Isaac Mizrahi has earned four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.
 Isaac Mizrahi: Well, you know what, I think it's all theater.
  And I think that these days, as a fashion designer, it's almost like you represent a political party or something.
  I love it.
  There's a movie called Unzipped about me that was a really successful movie.
 Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that.
 I don't really love travel.
 CNN: Say you're walking down the street.
  What's the most common style error that you see in people?.
 Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair.
  I would say that's the most common style error I see is bad hair.
 You know people have excuses for bad shoes because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they're walking and walking and walking but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair.
  Because you know what? There's a hat, if your hair is really that bad that day.
  What's the most common mistake people make there?.
 Mizrahi: You know what it is with people? I think people get lazy when it comes to being at home they leave things around.
  I like to think about cabinets.
  I like to put things away as much as possible.
  You know what I mean?.
 And people just think that bad flowers are better than nothing, but I disagree with that.
  I think that nothing is way better than bad flowers.
  Like at a dinner party, I prefer no flowers usually to the flowers that people have on the table.
 Mizrahi: It's gotten a lot quieter, my personal style.
  I used to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, and I don't know, I dress in a very particular way now and it's almost like clockwork.
 Mizrahi: I don't know.
