  Think again.

  Mentors and mentees are too often arbitrarily paired in the corporate world.
  But it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers in academia, the corporate world, public service, media, entertainment and the arts, whatever path talented young people might choose to recognize the subtle, unconscious biases that sometimes prevent Asians from achieving their true potential.
  A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group.
