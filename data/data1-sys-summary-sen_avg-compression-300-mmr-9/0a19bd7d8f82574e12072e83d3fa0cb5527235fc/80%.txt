Rein has said Black's next stop, after the Abu Dhabi conference, was supposed to be Malaysia.
 A former architect, Black often takes photos of buildings, according to Rein.
  We're relieved and happy with this news, Rein said.
 Black characterizes himself as an architect, cartoonist, graphic designer, professor and creativity consultant on his website.
