London Police in London were on Friday questioning a suspected rogue trader arrested after Swiss banking giant UBS discovered an estimated $2 billion worth of unauthorised deals.
 Credit rating agency Moody's has said it is looking at UBS for a possible downgrade.
 Rogue trader's impact on UBS.
 Finance ministers for the European Union member states, central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies are also present.
 The European Central Bank, along with the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, said three U.S. dollar auctions would be held to help out European banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt.
  Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year, said van Dam.
 A bank's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader's activities, he said.
 UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated.
 But the unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said.
 The loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading.
 Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel cost his French bank, Societe Generale, almost $6 billion, and was sentenced to three years in prison last year.
 A $2 billion rogue trading loss would be all but unprecedented, market analyst Ralph Silva told CNN..
 UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said.
 There is a much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clients' exposure to investment banking losses, he said.
 He favors that alternative, he said.
  The banks are too large, van Dam said.
 The bank is large enough to take a $2 billion hit, experts said.
