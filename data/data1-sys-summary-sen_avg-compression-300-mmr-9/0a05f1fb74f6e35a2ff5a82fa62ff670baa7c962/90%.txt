Rogue trader's impact on UBS.
  Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year, said van Dam.
 UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated.
 But the unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said.
 UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said.
  The banks are too large, van Dam said.
 The bank is large enough to take a $2 billion hit, experts said.
