 Although it's understandable for employees to be upset, frustrated and discouraged when benefits or perks are taken away, Kevin Sheridan, founder and CEO of HR Solutions, which specializes in helping organizations to keep employees engaged, said that employees are less likely to be upset if management communicates with employees.
  If leadership had simply asked employees which benefits were important to them, this situation may be avoided.
  Thirty-nine percent considered it for other reasons.
 Sixty-five percent of those employers indicated that they would cut back company social events, 61 percent anticipated curtailing business travel, 25 percent expected to scale back on health-care benefits and 11 percent planned to reduce wellness benefits.
 Such perks and benefits being taken away make for a tough situation for employees.
