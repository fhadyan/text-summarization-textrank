  We transitioned to a common boarding process across all aircraft, Hobart said.
 As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding.
 JetBlue offers families traveling coach with children under age 2 to board early, the airline said.
  Delta Air Lines said it also offers passengers with children an opportunity to preboard, including those with first class and business class tickets.
  The airline does allow passengers with children traveling in first class or business class to board early.
