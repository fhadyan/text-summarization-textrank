Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic once again faces two genocide charges instead of one in his long-running trial over ethnic violence during the 1990s Balkan wars.
 The 1992-95 Bosnian conflict was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia.
 Both men would face life in prison if convicted.
 Karadzic, whose trial began in 2010, also faces nine other charges related to ethnic violence during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
