London, England Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup.
 Television cameras showed Henry guiding the ball with his hand twice, before William Gallas scored from his resulting cross to give Les Bleus a narrow win in the two-legged World Cup play-off against the Republic of Ireland.
  The governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay.
 Delaney said the FAI had also written to the French football federation.
  Every time I go to a FIFA congress I hear about fair play and integrity.
  This was a defining game with the whole world watching, and if FIFA believe in fair play and integrity, this is their opportunity to step forward.
  The Football Association of Ireland is hoping that FIFA and its disciplinary committee will, on behalf of football fans worldwide, act in a similar fashion so that the standards of fair play and integrity can be protected, the FAI said.
 However, it said that under its regulations the referee's decision cannot be changed.
 Irish captain Richard Dunne, who spoke to Henry on the final whistle, said he felt cheated by the goal.
  He admitted he handled it, but it doesn't make me feel any better because we are not going to the World Cup finals, the defender said.
  FIFA will probably be happy.
  We're devastated.
 Ireland team manager Giovanni Trapattoni told reporters that the referee had time to ask the linesman and then Henry.
 The Irish Justice Ministry confirmed to CNN that Dermot Ahern had asked the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to demand a replay in the interests of fair play.
  Thierry Henry has admitted handling the ball, claims he told the ref he handled it.
 English Referees Union chief Alan Leighton told CNN that Swedish official Martin Hansson had clearly missed a huge decision.
