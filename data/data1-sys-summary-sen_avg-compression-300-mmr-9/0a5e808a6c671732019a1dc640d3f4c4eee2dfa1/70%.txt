 Nikolay Davydenko produced a ruthless display to beat U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro in straight sets to win the ATP World Tour Finals in London on Sunday.
 Serving for the title, he set up match point with an ace and took it when Del Potro could not return a fiece smash.
 Del Potro acknowledged he had been beaten by the better man on the day.
  Congratulations.
  You are a great champion, he said.
 Davydenko, seeded sixth, had begun the week with a thrilling three-set loss to Djokovic in round-robin play, but proceeded to rack up four straight victories, culminating in his emphatic win over fifth-ranked Del Potro.
 Del Potro looked weary after his epic three-set semifinal win over Swede Robin Soderling the previous night.
 The second set was tighter, with Del Potro having a break point in the sixth game.
