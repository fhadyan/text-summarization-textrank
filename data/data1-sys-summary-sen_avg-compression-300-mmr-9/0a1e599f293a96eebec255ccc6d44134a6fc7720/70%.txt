 North Korea has confirmed to Swedish diplomats that it is holding an American citizen, the U.S. State Department said Friday.
 According to the family, Newman and a traveling companion, Bill Hamrdla, had been on a 10-day organized private tour of North Korea.
 The day before Newman was to leave North Korea, he and his tour guide met with one or two Korean authorities, his son said.
 During that meeting, Newman's service record was discussed, Jeff Newman said.
  The tour arrangements were handled by the Korea International Travel Company, Thompson said.
  But the family of 85-year-old Merrill Newman of Palo Alto, California, has said he has been detained in North Korea since October 26..
 The family's statement came a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on North Korea to release Americans being held, calling the detentions very, very disturbing choices by the North Koreans.
 Newman is one of two American citizens being held in North Korea.
  The North Korean government has said he was found guilty of hostile acts and attempts to topple the government.
 North Korea has not publicly said why it is holding Newman.
