What's not new is the teamwork between the DEA and vetted Honduran police who participate in the operations, Posivak said.
 Operation Anvil seeks to track planes entering Honduras, ascertains where they will land, and then sends helicopters out to make arrests, Posivak said.
 The DEA is in Honduras at the request of our government in a support and training capacity, Hernandez said.
  It's not a problem that can be solved by law enforcement alone, he said.
 The goal is to address security concerns through all means, he said.
 Hernandez, the Honduran ambassador, counters that Operation Anvil and other programs are not military operations, but law enforcement ones.
 Drug cartels exert such influence in the region that both law enforcement and civilian government agencies have been corrupted, he said.
 Posivak, the U.S. embassy spokesman, said Operation Anvil has already proven successful at disrupting criminal organizations.
