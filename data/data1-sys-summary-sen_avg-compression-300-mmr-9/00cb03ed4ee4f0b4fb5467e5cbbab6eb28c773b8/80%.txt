 The International Atomic Energy Agency issued a critical report Tuesday saying that it has serious concerns about Iran's nuclear program and has obtained credible information that the Islamic republic may be developing nuclear weapons.
 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad slammed the report as a fabrication of facts aimed at satisfying U.S. allegations about Iran's nuclear program.
 Since 2002, the IAEA has regularly received new information pertaining to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile, the report said.
 It said Iran has made efforts, some successful, to procure nuclear related and dual use equipment and materials by military related individuals and entities and has acquired nuclear weapons information from a clandestine nuclear supply network.
 It has also worked on mastering the design of a nuclear weapon and tested components, the report said.
 Iran has repeatedly insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian energy purposes only.
 Rogers, R-Michigan, said new sanctions should cut off the supply of refined fuel to Iran and target its central bank, which he said is being used to finance Tehran's nuclear program.
  The agency has serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program, the report said.
 Western powers have long suspected that Iran's nuclear program is geared toward weapons development.
