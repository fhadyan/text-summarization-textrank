From Rucker's DailyMile blog: April 18, 2011 First day of the Couch to 5K program.
 Change is a funny thing, Rucker says.
 In the summer of 2010, Rucker, of Lexington, Kentucky, and his family went to Dollywood in Tennessee.
  She was devastated; I was crushed, Rucker said.
 In January 2011, he reconnected with an old elementary school friend, Anita Mills, and the two began talking on Facebook, discussing Mills' 240-pound weight loss.
 The day after the 2011 Super Bowl, Rucker woke up in pain.
  Something clicked, he said.
 Rucker took Mills' dieting hints to heart and cut out sugary drinks.
  Since February 2011, Rucker has run his first 5K, his first 10K, his first half-marathon and his first marathon.
  The focus he has, the drive he has it's so refreshing, Annita Rucker said.
  My wife jokes, 'I've got a brand new husband Rucker said with a long laugh.
  I think she's a lot happier with me because I'm much happier.
 Rucker is now training for his first Ironman competition.
  What he does after this Ironman, I don't know, his wife, Annita Rucker, said with a laugh.
 Rucker has rejoined the social world.
 Rucker wants to become a motivational speaker, to be that inspiration for others that Mills was for him.
  When I was so overweight, I felt so dead to everything, Rucker said.
