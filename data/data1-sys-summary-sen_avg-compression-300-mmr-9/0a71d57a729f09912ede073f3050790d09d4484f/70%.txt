 Almost 30 years later, Etan Patz is still missing.
  Watch an update on the case Â».
 Etan Patz, who disappeared in 1979, was the first missing child featured in the milk carton campaigns of the 1980s.
 When police found Ramos in his drainpipe home, they found he had many photographs of small blond boys.
  They noticed that they looked a lot like Etan Patz, according to author Lisa R Cohen's book about the case, After Etan: The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive.
 Bronx police questioned Ramos, and he denied having anything to do with Etan's disappearance.
  He left town and disappeared for six years until GraBois reviewed Etan's case.
  GraBois said he focused on Ramos as the prime suspect.
 GraBois said he learned in 1988 that Ramos had been arrested and convicted of child molestation and was serving time in a Pennsylvania prison.
 GraBois said he brought Ramos to New York for questioning and surprised him with the question: How many times did you have sex with Etan Patz? .
 Ramos told GraBois that he'd taken a little boy to an apartment he had on the lower East Side on the same day that Etan went missing.
  Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights, GraBois said.
 Ramos is serving a 10- to 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania.
 GraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison, and planted informants as his cell mates.
 Etan's case is still considered by the NYPD to be a cold case.
