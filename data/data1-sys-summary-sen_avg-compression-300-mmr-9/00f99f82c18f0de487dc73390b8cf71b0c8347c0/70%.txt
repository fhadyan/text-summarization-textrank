 Homeland security officials on Wednesday abruptly shelved a proposal to build a national database of license-plate scans after criticism from privacy advocates.
  The solicitation, which was posted without the awareness of ICE leadership, has been canceled, said spokeswoman Gillian Christensen.
  The database should track vehicle license plate numbers that pass through cameras or are voluntarily entered into the system from a variety of sources (access control systems, asset recovery specialists, etc and uploaded to share with law enforcement, the original solicitation read.
 The proposed National License Plate Recognition database was to have been used by immigration officers to find and arrest fugitives.
 Supporters of license-plate scanning, like former New York state homeland security chief Michael Balboni, said it could have been an invaluable tool for finding dangerous suspects.
