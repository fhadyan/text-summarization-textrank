 The flight data and cockpit voice recorders from JetBlue Flight 191, which made an emergency landing this week, have been retrieved and will be analyzed, officials said Thursday.
 The National Transportation Safety Board will download the data Friday, said spokeswoman Kelly Nantel.
 The cockpit voice recorder captures two hours of data and the flight data recorder, which measures the plane's speed and altitude, contains 25 hours.
  A court official said Osbon was still under care Thursday.
 Osbon's stepmother said Thursday she has flown with him several times.
 Crew and passengers subdued Osbon as he screamed and banged on the door so hard the first officer thought Osbon would come through, according to a federal criminal complaint filed Wednesday against Osbon.
  The aircraft crashed near Daytona Beach Regional Airport.
