Haylee Donathan was found with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, fugitive sex offender Robbie Potter.
 Potter and Watson were still using the same vehicle, a 1980s blue Chevrolet pickup truck they drove from Ohio, Elliott said.
 Authorities had feared Haylee was endangered.
 Haylee Donathan, her mother Candace Watson and Robbie Potter were discovered hiding for the past week at The Morning Star Ranch, a retreat in Valley Center, near San Diego, said Peter Elliott, United States Marshal for the Northern District of Ohio.
 Potter is a registered sex offender, officials said.
