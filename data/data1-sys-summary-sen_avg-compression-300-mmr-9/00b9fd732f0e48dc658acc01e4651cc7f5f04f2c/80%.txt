 Jeff Yeager says the economic downturn is an opportunity for people to simplify their lives and be content with less.
 More than 40 percent of the average household food budget is spent on eating out, says Jeff Yeager.
  Maybe we can simplify our lives, be content with less and actually enjoy life more.
  Really?.
 Yeager: Give up the cellulite life.
  I've never owned a cell phone, and nothing awful has ever happened.
  Average cell phone plan costs about $100 a month.
 Collins: Wow.
  All right.
 Collins: OK. Give up meals prepared outside your home.
 Yeager: More than 40 percent of the average American family household food budget is spent on meals prepared outside the home.
  You can cut that by 80 percent by cooking those same meals at home and you know, maybe recapture some family time around the dinner table.
  Every dinner, every business meeting, every lunch.
 Collins: Yes, yes.
 Yeager: Yes.
  Less than 2 percent of clothes that we throw away in America are worn out.
 Yeager: And again, less than 2 percent of the clothes we throw away are worn out.
 Back in my days, lots of people, including myself, lived at home when we went to college.
