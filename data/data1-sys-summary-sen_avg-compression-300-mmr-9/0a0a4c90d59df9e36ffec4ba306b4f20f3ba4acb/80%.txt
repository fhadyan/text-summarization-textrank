Critics of Zero Dark Thirty fear that audiences will accept as true the film's story line that torture was effective in eliciting information to locate bin Laden.
 Peter Bergen: Did torture really net bin Laden?.
 Opposition to the film escalated last week as three senior U.S. senators John McCain, Carl Levin and Dianne Feinstein sent a letter to the film's distributor, Sony Pictures, characterizing the film's use of torture as grossly inaccurate and misleading.
 How concerned is the gas industry?.
  They are wrong.
 So go ahead, enjoy these films and ones like them that are based on actual events or current hot issues.
 The first, Zero Dark Thirty, is about the pursuit and killing of Osama bin Laden, which features scenes of torture.
  The second, Promised Land, stars Matt Damon and explores how the use of fracking to drill for natural gas can pose health and environmental dangers.
