 military's Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility have been resettled in Bermuda, officials said Thursday.
  Watch concerns about resettling the Uyghur detainees Â».
  is extremely grateful to the government of Bermuda.
  The Chinese statement followed an offer by Palau, a Pacific island nation, to accept the Uyghur detainees.
 Issues to be worked out include how to transfer the Uyghurs to Palau and how much money the United States would give the men for resettlement, the official said.
 The United States will not send Uyghur detainees cleared for release back to China out of concern that they would be tortured by Chinese authorities.
  China has said no returned Uyghurs would be tortured.
 Palau said it will take in the ethnic Uyghur detainees for humanitarian reasons and because of the special relationship between Palau and the United States.
 In 2006, five other Uyghur detainees were transferred to Albania, according to the Justice Department, which said it has no reports they took part in any post-resettlement criminal behavior or terrorist activities.
 Since 2002, more than 540 detainees have departed Guantanamo for other countries, including Albania, Algeria, Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Belgium, Denmark, Egypt, France, Great Britain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Mauritania, Morocco, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uganda, the United Kingdom and Yemen, the Justice Department said.
