SEOUL, South Korea The last bit of news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells into the sea near the border with South Korea.
 Disturbing news from North Korea comes just as often as stories that make us laugh in disbelief.
 With its conventional and nuclear arsenals, North Korea manages to keep the international community, including the United States, scrambling for an approach that might neutralize the danger and send a lifeline to the victims of the cruel regime.
 It's tempting to ignore North Korea's antics as bluster, as empty threats.
  North Korean government researchers announced their country is the second happiest in the world second only to China.
 The three generations of Kim men who have ruled the North are painted as supernatural to the local population.
  By firing missiles, threatening neighbors and acting erratically, North Korea portrays itself as mysterious and volatile, and even that perception magnifies its ability to create fear, adding to its power and helping keep the despotic regime in control.
 Those are two sides of North Korea deliberately frightening and inadvertently comical.
 A yearlong investigation conducted by the United Nations found that North Korea is a country whose depth of brutality does not have any parallel in the contemporary world.
 According to the report, North Korea engages in murder, torture, slavery and mass starvation to terrorize the population into submission.
 North Korea is a Riddle Kingdom that is simultaneously threatening, bizarre and brutal.
