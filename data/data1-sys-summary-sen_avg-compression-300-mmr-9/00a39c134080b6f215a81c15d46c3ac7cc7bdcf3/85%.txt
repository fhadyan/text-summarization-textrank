 I love it.
 Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that.
  Always.
 I don't really love travel.
 CNN: Say you're walking down the street.
 Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair.
  I would say that's the most common style error I see is bad hair.
 You know people have excuses for bad shoes because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they're walking and walking and walking but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair.
  Because you know what? There's a hat, if your hair is really that bad that day.
  I like to think about cabinets.
  I think that nothing is way better than bad flowers.
  I used to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, and I don't know, I dress in a very particular way now and it's almost like clockwork.
 Mizrahi: I don't know.
