 Even in death, peace seemed to elude little Myls Dobson.
 Myls' father, Okee Wade, who has a lengthy arrest record, was jailed in New Jersey on conspiracy, theft and money laundering charges just days after dropping his son off with King in mid-December, authorities said.
  We're trying to get this child buried with dignity and respect, said Tony Herbert, a spokesman for Dobson.
 The boy had burn marks and abrasions on his head, neck, face and testicles, court papers said.
  The child appeared malnourished, the complaint said.
 King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch on December 17 and that she was the child's primary and sole caretaker until the time of his death, the complaint said.
 At a news conference Friday, Herbert said that Dobson lost custody of her son for financial reasons.
  Herbert and Dobson demanded answers from child welfare authorities.
  The record reflected serious mental health issues that would have prevented her from properly caring for the young boy, he said.
 Dobson told police that Myls later fell down stairs and struck his head.
 In tears, she said, I love my son.
 King, the baby-sitter, told police that on December 29 she removed a hot rack from an oven with a glove and allegedly placed it against the boy's right leg, leaving linear burn marks, the complaint said.
  On the day she freed him, the complaint said, King allegedly beat him 12 to 13 times with a belt.
 On January 7, during subfreezing temperatures, King told police she allegedly locked the child, wearing only a T-shirt and shorts, outside on a balcony from 20 minutes to an hour, the complaint said.
 King told authorities that the boy was being very difficult eating and that the last full meal he ate was on December 26, 2013; after that he would only pick at his food, the complaint said.
 After arriving at King's home on December 17, the complaint said, Myls Dobson lost 20 to 25 pounds.
