 He pleaded not guilty.
  We're trying to get this child buried with dignity and respect, said Tony Herbert, a spokesman for Dobson.
 The boy had burn marks and abrasions on his head, neck, face and testicles, court papers said.
  The child appeared malnourished, the complaint said.
 At a news conference Friday, Herbert said that Dobson lost custody of her son for financial reasons.
  Herbert and Dobson demanded answers from child welfare authorities.
 Dobson told police that Myls later fell down stairs and struck his head.
 In tears, she said, I love my son.
 After arriving at King's home on December 17, the complaint said, Myls Dobson lost 20 to 25 pounds.
