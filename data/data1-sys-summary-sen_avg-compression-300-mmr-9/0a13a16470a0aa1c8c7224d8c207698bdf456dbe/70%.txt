 A grand jury indicted Jeffs May 10 on two counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two counts of incest for alleged incidents that occurred in 2002, according to a statement issued by Mohave County Attorney Matthew J. Smith.
 Jeffs previously was charged in Arizona with two counts of sexual conduct with a minor for allegedly presiding over arranged marriages, along with an additional charge of conspiracy.
 Those charges, from 2005, were put on hold while Jeffs faces trial in Utah.
 Jeffs was captured August 28, 2006, in a traffic stop near Las Vegas, Nevada.
