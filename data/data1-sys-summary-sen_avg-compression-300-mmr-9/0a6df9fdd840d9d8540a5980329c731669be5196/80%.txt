Opinion: Has Putin broken international law?.
 After all, in the eyes of many ethnic Russians, it is the Ukrainian nationalists not Putin who are the Nazis.

 Opinion: Putin 2014 vs.
  Putin 2004.
  Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union until two decades ago (whereas Crimea was part of Russia until 1954 the country contains millions of ethnic Russians and, crucially, it has Russian military installations that are key to Russia's strategic interests.
 Nevertheless, calling Putin Hitler is careless.
  Even reckless.
 Of course, what also gets everybody so nervous is leading statesmen comparing Putin to Hitler and, thereby, raising the specter of another world war.
