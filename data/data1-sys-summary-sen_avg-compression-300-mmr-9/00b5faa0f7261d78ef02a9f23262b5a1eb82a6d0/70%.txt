 As president after president has discovered, there are innumerable ways opponents can stop measures from getting passed, even if the president's party holds a majority in Congress.
 American politicians are independent political entrepreneurs.
 When Bill Clinton first became president, he had a solid Democratic majority in Congress.
  Health care reform.
  The Clinton plan failed, and within two years, Democrats lost their majority in Congress.
  Bush had trouble getting what he wanted notably, immigration reform from a Republican Congress.
  Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 2006..

  That's why politicians in the U.S. are always declaring crises a drug crisis, an education crisis, an environmental crisis.

  Members of Congress who try to block President Obama's program may find themselves in political trouble.
 American government is not an efficient, well-oiled machine.
 Obama won the biggest Democratic majority for president in 44 years.
  His party made big gains in Congress.
