Clarksburg, West Virginia North Central West Virginia Airport boasts quick check-ins, free, accessible parking and a convenient baggage claim.
 In addition to the $1 million based on passenger traffic, the Clarksburg airport got $30 million to lengthen its runway in 1999 and another $1.6 million from the Obama administration's economic stimulus bill in 2009. Local students get free flights to Washington for school trips as well, Rock said.
  It's special.
  But the airport offers a special treat as the end of the year approaches free sightseeing flights.
