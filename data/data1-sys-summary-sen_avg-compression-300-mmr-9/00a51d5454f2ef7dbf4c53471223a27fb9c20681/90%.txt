 Marco Rubio is all in.
 Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.
 Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.
 Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.
  By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters.
 Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
