 Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, right, meets with Richard Holbrooke in Kabul on February 15, 2009..
  We have to defeat terrorism.
 At the same time, Karzai said the actions of troops currently in Afghanistan have turned some of the public against them.
  It's the question of home searches, he said.
  But Afghanistan deserves respect and a better treatment.
  What should have happened early on didn't unfortunately happen, Karzai said.
 The Obama administration is conducting several reviews of U.S. policy in Afghanistan, including a review by Gen.
 Holbrooke is visiting Afghanistan after a trip to neighboring Pakistan.
 Speaking via satellite from Kabul, Karzai called former President George Bush a great person, but said he can work with Obama despite the president's comments as a candidate that Karzai had not gotten out of the bunker to improve security and infrastructure in Afghanistan.
  President Obama is a great inspiration to the world, he said.
 Karzai also acknowledged corruption in the Afghan government, but defended the work he's done to combat it.
  Sure, corruption in the Afghan government is as much there as in any other third world country, he said.
  President Obama and Secretary Clinton and the United States government were very gratified to hear President Karzai reaffirm his support of the August 20 decision, Holbrooke said.
  U.S. forces will not be able to leave soon in Afghanistan because the task is not over, Karzai said.
