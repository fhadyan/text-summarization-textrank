 Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, right, meets with Richard Holbrooke in Kabul on February 15, 2009..
  We have to defeat terrorism.
 At the same time, Karzai said the actions of troops currently in Afghanistan have turned some of the public against them.
  But Afghanistan deserves respect and a better treatment.
  What should have happened early on didn't unfortunately happen, Karzai said.
 Holbrooke is visiting Afghanistan after a trip to neighboring Pakistan.
  President Obama is a great inspiration to the world, he said.
  Sure, corruption in the Afghan government is as much there as in any other third world country, he said.
  President Obama and Secretary Clinton and the United States government were very gratified to hear President Karzai reaffirm his support of the August 20 decision, Holbrooke said.
  U.S. forces will not be able to leave soon in Afghanistan because the task is not over, Karzai said.
