LOS ANGELES, California Michael Jackson's ex-wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, has agreed not to challenge the singer's mother for custody of the children, according to a joint statement from lawyers for Rowe and Katherine Jackson.
 Debbie Rowe will not pursue custody of the children she bore with Michael Jackson, a lawyer says.
 Beckloff will also hear arguments Monday about Jackson's estate and who will control it.
  Jackson and Debbie Rowe were on the exact same page, McMillan said.
 He said the executors have either denied Mrs.
 The couple divorced in 1999 with Rowe giving Jackson full custody while she got an $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents.
  Jackson later agreed to additional support.
 Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children.
 Katherine Jackson gained temporary guardianship of the three children soon after his death last month.
