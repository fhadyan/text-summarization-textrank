Washington The much-maligned, color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System is about to be consigned to the proverbial dustbin of history.
  The old color coded system taught Americans to be scared, not prepared, said ranking member Rep.
  Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi.
 President George W. Bush established the Homeland Security Advisory System by presidential directive on March 11, 2002, just a few months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.
 Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is expected to announce Thursday that the almost 9-year-old threat alert system will go away in April.
 The general threat level is yellow/elevated.
 Almost from the start, the threat level system was the butt of jokes and multiple parodies.
 The Bush administration denied Ridge's assertions, however.
  Though the system served a valuable purpose in the terrible days and months following the terrorist attacks of September 11, it was clearly time for the current color-coded system to be replaced with a more targeted system, King said.
