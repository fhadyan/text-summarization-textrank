The Clinton Foundation admitted last month that a 2010 donation from the Algerian government was not properly approved under the guidelines the Obama administration put in place with the foundation when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009. Bill Clinton defended the donations as something that went to worthwhile projects.
  On Saturday, Clinton did the same.
  And then let people make their judgments, Clinton said.
  Neither Hillary or Chelsea Clinton mentioned the issue.
 Saturday's event is the university-focused branch of the Clinton Foundation.
  In total, the foundation will hand out $900,000 to the different students.
 Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman are among the countries that donated to the Clinton Foundation.
