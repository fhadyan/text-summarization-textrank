Tamir, who had what police said is an air gun that looked like a real firearm, died Sunday, a day after he was shot outside a recreation center.
 Video shows officer shoot Tamir.
  (The officer's) door was open as they pulled up, Tomba said.
 Police have said Tamir reached into his waistband and pulled out the weapon.
  The video shows Loehmann, the passenger-side officer, exiting the car, and Tamir falls down, apparently shot.
  Twice the caller said the gun might be fake.
 Loehmann joined the department in March, Tomba said.
