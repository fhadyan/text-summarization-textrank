 South African golf was handed another boost on Tuesday when the country was awarded the right to host one of the lucrative World Golf Championships events for the next five years.
  This is, without doubt, the most significant milestone in the history of professional golf in South Africa, Sunshine Tour commissioner Gareth Tindall said on his return from Augusta following meetings with the U.S. PGA Tour and the International Federation of PGA Tours.
 The date and venue for South Africa's first staging next year have yet to be announced, but it will feature the top 70 players in the world.
