It's one of the issues opponents to home genetic testing kits raise most often.
 Scientists have identified more than 2,000 single gene disorders, says Rebecca Nagy, president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.
  It's not that the science behind (this kind of genetic testing) isn't good.
 Hartmann's genetic code showed two mutations that are linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, he says the site told him.
 The upside of these at-home genetic testing kits and 23andMe isn't the only company that sells them is that they've generated a lot of buzz about genetics, Nagy says.
 Nagy recommends anyone who wants to do genetic testing first talk to a genetic counselor.
  They're also trained in explaining test results to laymen.
 Parents push for standardized screening of Jewish genetic diseases.
 Genetic testing can be a powerful tool.
