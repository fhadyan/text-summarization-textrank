Schumacher, 45, sustained severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on December 29..
 His investigative team said it thinks the experienced skier hit a rock hidden beneath the snow while traversing an area between two marked pistes, which catapulted him face-first onto another rock.
