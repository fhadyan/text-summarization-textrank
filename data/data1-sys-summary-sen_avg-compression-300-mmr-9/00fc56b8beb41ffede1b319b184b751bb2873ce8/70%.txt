Laura Dekker will find out on Friday whether the Dutch Court will back her record attempt.
 Laura's parents are happy about Friday's decision, family lawyer Peter de Lange said.
 The teenager was out sailing Friday, de Lange said.
 Laura believes she will be able to convince the court that she is fit to make the trip alone, de Lange said.
 Laura said she has dreamed of sailing around the world since she was 10 and her parents are determined to help her achieve her goal.
 Laura Dekker's parents support her round-the-world ambition, which sparked concern from child protection officials because of her age.
  He said he doesn't think age alone should determine whether Laura Dekker is ready for such an adventure.
 Another sailor, Robin Knox-Johnston, also said age shouldn't be the only determining factor.
  They took the case to court to prevent the solo trip.
 The move prevents the parents from permitting Laura to set off on her trip alone, though Laura will remain at home with her father, Dick Dekker, a court official said.
 The court will then make a final ruling on whether her parents may have the final say about their daughter's plans, the court official said.
