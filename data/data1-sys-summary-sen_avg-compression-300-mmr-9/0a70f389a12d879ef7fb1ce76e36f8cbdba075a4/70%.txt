 He is in that landing pattern that middle-aged heartthrobs finally come to: time for home and family and a woman who is worthy of keeping his love.
 The 50-plus Oscar winner, producer and political activist George Clooney is apparently engaged to be married.
  In his films, he has played lost middle-aged men, lost in their careers, lost in neglected marriages, lost because of a lack of connection to something important Up in the Air, The Descendents, Michael Clayton, among others.
  Many of these men reshuffle their lives, readjust their principles or at least find some self knowledge they sorely lacked.
  Clooney's doing that middle-aged love choice.
  He's at a particularly pivotal age.
  Unlike a woman his age, Clooney can do the whole settling-down gambit at almost any age.
 Middle age is an important time for reassessment and course correction.
  This is the real anchor of middle-aged love: It's time to stop fooling around.
