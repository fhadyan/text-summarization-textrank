Biggest Challenge.
 From day one I've never worked with leather or fur.
  I don't work with PVC, and I'm very conscious in the sourcing and manufacturing of fashion.
  That's a hurdle, that's a challenge, but it's a worthwhile one.
  I've had people say to me: You'll never sell handbags, you don't work with leather and leather is luxury.
  Over 50 million animals a year are killed just for fashion.
 CNN: So you're comfortable flipping that notion on its head, that leather is luxury?.
 The fashion industry, is not really as accountable for some reason.
