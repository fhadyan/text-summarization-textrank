 Asked whether she had any regrets, Fromme said, No.
 Fromme became eligible for parole in 1985, Ponce said.
 Fromme was not granted parole until July 2008, Ponce said.
  At the time, prison officials said they were looking into rumors that Fromme escaped after hearing Manson was ill, according to news reports.
 In the WCHS interview, Fromme said that Manson should not be incarcerated because he didn't kill anybody.
 Fromme wanted to be heard on issues including the environment, he said.
 In the 1978 interview, Fromme called Manson a once-in-a-lifetime soul.
  She said she still corresponded with him.
  A prison spokeswoman would not say whether Fromme continues to correspond with Manson.
