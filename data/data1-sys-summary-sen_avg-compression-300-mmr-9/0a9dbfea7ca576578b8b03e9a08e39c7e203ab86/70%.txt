Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, led the GOP charge against the bill and accused Democrats of crafting it to favor labor unions traditionally Democratic allies over other types of donors.
 McConnell cited a recent Wall Street Journal analysis that found labor unions spent $4.4 billion on campaigns between 2005 and 2011..
 Democrats disagreed with the Republicans' assertion that labor unions are exempt from their legislation.
  However, the concern about labor unions appeared to sway key Republicans such as Sen.
  Democrats unanimously supported the bill, while Republicans voted unanimously against it.
 Opinion: Why Democrats need labor unions.
  During this election, outside spending by GOP shell groups is expected to top $1 billion, said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, in a floor speech.
 Democrats say the requirement is a much-needed response to the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizen United decision, which opened the doors to large amounts of campaign spending by corporations, labor unions and other groups.
