Jurors convicted Joshua Komisarjevsky in October on six capital felony charges.
 Petit is the sole survivor of the attack that killed his wife and two daughters.
 The two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation, while William Petit managed to escape from the basement, where he had been held.
 Komisarjevsky responded Friday, saying that he came into this trial angry and defiant.
