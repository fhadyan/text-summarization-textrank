 Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, known to many people more as an aggrieved movie character or perceived tax dodger than as an actual person, has finally spoken out.
 Saverin has had little to do with Facebook in recent years.
 Saverin continues to work as an investor and partner in Internet startups from his Singapore apartment, where an office contains three, 27-inch Mac monitors on which he constantly monitors everything from stock prices to the weather, Altman writes.
  I don't like showing my private life online, he said.
 Surprise: The Internet hates rich people.
