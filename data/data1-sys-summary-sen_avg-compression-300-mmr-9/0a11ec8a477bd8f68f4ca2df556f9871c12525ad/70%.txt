 Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, known to many people more as an aggrieved movie character or perceived tax dodger than as an actual person, has finally spoken out.
 In an interview with a magazine in his family's native Brazil, Saverin a newly minted billionaire after Facebook's public stock offering talked about his taxes, his relationship with co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and life after The Social Network.
  I can only speak well of Mark; I don't resent him, Saverin said.
 Saverin has had little to do with Facebook in recent years.
  The decision was strictly based on my interest of living and working in Singapore, he said.
 Many observers believe Saverin, who, according to the Facebook origin story was slighted by Zuckerberg as the site grew, was a primary source for the book The Accidental Billionaires, on which Social Network is based.
 Saverin continues to work as an investor and partner in Internet startups from his Singapore apartment, where an office contains three, 27-inch Mac monitors on which he constantly monitors everything from stock prices to the weather, Altman writes.
 Surprise: The Internet hates rich people.
