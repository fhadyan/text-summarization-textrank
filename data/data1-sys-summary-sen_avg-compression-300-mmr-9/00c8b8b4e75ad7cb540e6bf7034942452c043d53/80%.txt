Messi has been handed the responsibility by new Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella after their disappointing Copa America campaign.
  He is the captain from now on, Sabella told gathered reporters Wednesday ahead of the match in the 120,000 capacity Salt Lake stadium in Kolkata.
  Winning will give us confidence.
