 Our primary focus here was to find Relisha, Lanier said Monday.
  That search is continuing.
 Lanier said after Relisha was last seen, Tatum continued to go to work and was seen around the capital several times between March 2 and March 20. Lanier said Relisha was not with Tatum in any of those sightings.
