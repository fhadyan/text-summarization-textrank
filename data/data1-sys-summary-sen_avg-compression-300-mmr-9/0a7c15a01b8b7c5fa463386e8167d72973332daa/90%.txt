Leaders of Libya's interim government have said Gadhafi was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him Thursday.
  He said crowds beat Gadhafi in what was a humiliating end for the former dictator.
 An amateur video distributed by the Reuters news agency Sunday showed NTC fighters congratulating a man the fighters say killed Gadhafi.
  CNN could not independently verify that claim.
  Taken together, these videos are very disturbing, he said.
 No foreign or independent officials were present, Zentani said.
