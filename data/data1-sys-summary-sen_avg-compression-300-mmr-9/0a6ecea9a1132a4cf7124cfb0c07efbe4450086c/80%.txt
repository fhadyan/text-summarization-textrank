When the May 26 directive was issued, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said dispersant use should be cut by 75 percent.
  The directive states that BP must ramp down dispersant use by 75 percent from the maximum daily amount used.
  The EPA and Coast Guard say they're trying to keep dispersant use to around 18,000 barrels a day.
 But the struggle over daily dispersant use has caught the eye of Rep.
  We expect to see a substantial reduction in the overall amount of dispersant used, Jackson said in May.
 Before May 26, BP used 25,689 gallons a day of the chemical dispersant Corexit.
 But the EPA argues it deserves credit for getting alarming dispersant use under control.
