 The Boston Bruins won their first Stanley Cup in 39 years, defeating the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 Wednesday night in the seventh and deciding game of the National Hockey League's annual championship.
 Freelance Journalist Jorge Contreras told CNN that 1,000-2,000 people were on the streets in downtown Vancouver, and that six police vehicles had been set on fire.
 After dropping the first two games in Vancouver, the Bruins took four of the last five games from the Canucks, who struggled to stay in Game Seven after going down 1-0 in the first period.
 Marchand would finish the game with two goals and one assist.
 Coming into the series, Vancouver was considered the superior squad on special teams, especially on power plays.
  Vancouver was also outscored 10-0 in the second period.
 Patrice Bergeron's first period goal should have been enough for fans to know the game's outcome, as the team that scored the first goal won every game in this series.
