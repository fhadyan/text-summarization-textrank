 As the world knows, peace can sometimes be fleeting.
 One-time basketball bad boy Ron Artest, who changed his name to Metta World Peace and said it was meaningful and inspirational, was ejected Sunday from the Los Angeles Lakers-Oklahoma City Thunder game for hitting James Harden in the head with his elbow.
 On Monday, the Thunder said Harden was undergoing testing.
 Sports fans were baffled, some even amused, when World Peace announced last year that he planned to legally change his name from Ron Artest.
  Ron Artest has contemplated the name change for years and always knew that he wanted his last name to be World Peace.
 The NBA suspended Artest for 86 games.
 Fast forward to September 2011, when Artest announced the name change.
 Even before it was finalized by the court, World Peace was working on making the world a more peaceful place.
 But in the world, peace sometimes comes with a price: The NBA is now reviewing World Peace's less than peaceable actions.
 World Peace was ejected from the game and faces possible suspension.
