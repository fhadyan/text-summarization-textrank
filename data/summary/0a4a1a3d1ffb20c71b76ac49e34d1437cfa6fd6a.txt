NEW: Dozens have searched for three missing boys along Michigan-Ohio border
An Amber Alert is out for three boys -- ages 5, 7 and 9 -- who were last seen Friday
The boy's father told police he left the boys with a woman he'd met on the internet
Police still don't know if the father's story is true or whether the woman he mentions is real
