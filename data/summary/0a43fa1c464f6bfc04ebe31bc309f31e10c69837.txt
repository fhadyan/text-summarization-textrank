Matika Wilbur began touring the country in 2012 to photograph Native Americans
Those images, Project 562, show the diversity of  Native American identity
Project 562 is on display at the Tacoma Art Museum until October 2014
Wilbur hopes to turn the images into books and websites that share native culture
