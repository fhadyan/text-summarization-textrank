 Marco Rubio is all in  The Republican senator from Florida has announced that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the American Dream With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016  Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations  He holds little appeal to Latino voters  And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep Back in 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate Gang of 8 that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants  He later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from House Republicans, and now says he favors a piecemeal approach, starting with securing the border His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates  That's a shame, for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to Latino voters Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration  He believes that President Obama's Deferred Action program, offering deportation relief to young immigrants, should be ended  He has stated that the President's executive action on immigration, on hold pending a circuit court review, sets a horrifying precedent Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics  No wonder the research firm Latino Decisions reports that, We find no evidence that Rubio's candidacy will draw significant Latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally  So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken At a private breakfast Monday for supporters, Rubio described running against one candidate in the race who's from yesterday, and one who wants to take us back to yesterday  But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past  Over the weekend, he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous He has warned that Cuba is taking advantage of the United States  Here, he is an increasingly lonely voice  Most Americans support better relations with Cuba, as do a majority of Cuban-Americans  By clinging to the notion that isolating Cuba is better than engaging with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics  He is a fierce opponent of Obamacare and wants the law repealed  However, the Affordable Care Act has led to a 12 3% drop in the Hispanic uninsured rate, making Latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance, thanks to the law  (In fact, Rubio signed his own family up for Obamacare on the Washington exchange, taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers  Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals
