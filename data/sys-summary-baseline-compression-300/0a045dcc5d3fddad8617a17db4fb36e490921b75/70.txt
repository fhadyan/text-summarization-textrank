DES MOINES, Iowa The 2016 Republican presidential race in Iowa got its unofficial start Saturday with a marathon of speeches, giving close to a dozen potential candidates a chance to introduce (or re-introduce) themselves to a core group of caucus-goers roughly one year before the contest Immigration and Islamic extremism took front and center as the White House hopefuls sought to test-drive their stump speeches  On style, it was Wisconsin Gov  Scott Walker and Texas Sen  Ted Cruz who saw strong receptions from the audience, though support for a wide number of candidates was expressed in the hallways after the event New Jersey Gov  Chris Christie also sought to establish a deeper bond with Iowa  The Hawkeye State receives outsized attention in presidential years thanks to its first-in-the-nation status during the primary season Marathon time For the 10-hour day of back-to-back speeches, the candidates as they were called joined other high-profile Republicans at Hoyt Sherman Place, an old, intricate theater built in 1877 that also became the first public art museum in Des Moines Billed as the Iowa Freedom Summit, the event was co-hosted by Citizens United and Rep  Steve King, a revered lawmaker who represents the northwestern part of the state and has considerable clout among the more social conservative and Christian right faction of the party It was no secret that it was considered a cattle call for the presidential race  Former Arkansas Gov  Mike Huckabee, for example, said that the reason he ended his Fox News show was for a bigger goal he has in mind  It wasn't just so I can go deer hunting every weekend, I can assure you that, he said Others were more blatant  I am a potential presidential candidate, yes I am, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina told CNN Even Palin angled to get in on some of the action, teasing ahead of her appearance Saturday that she was now seriously considering a run  And real estate titan Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that he'll make his decision before June  I'm the one person who can make this country great again, that's all I know, he told reporters Saturday  Nobody else can Palin, in her remarks, was less forward  Ticking through a somewhat dizzying and hard-to-follow speech, Palin suggested that the country is ready for a woman leader just not Hillary Clinton  Hey Iowa, can anyone stop Hillary? she said, prompting the audience to cheer  To borrow a phrase, yes we can!  The class of 2016 The speakers, who were typically allotted 20 minutes, used a bulk of their speeches to share their own personal upbringings  Ben Carson and Christie talked about their strict but sharp mothers, while Wisconsin Gov  Scott Walker and Texas Sen  Ted Cruz talked about having pastors as fathers Other more well-known names in Iowa — like former Pennsylvania Sen  Rick Santorum who won the state's caucuses in 2012 and Huckabee, who won in 2008 — tried to remind Iowans why they picked them in the first place, dipping into their personalities but also focusing on the issues Given King's firebrand credentials as an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, it was no surprise that problems at the border became a focal point in much of the speeches Saturday Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, argued there wouldn't be people coming in here if there wasn't a magnet pulling them in, suggesting there should be criminal punishment for employers who hire undocumented workers The main target in the immigration battle, however, was President Barack Obama's executive action to delay deportation for up to five million undocumented immigrants  Or as Palin put it, in her folksy swagger, Obama's decision makes him seem like an overgrown little boy who's just acting kinda spoiled Speakers railed against the President's pledge to use his pen and his phone to work around Congress, with immigration as just one example of what many called the president's overreach That was punctuated when DREAM Act Coalition protesters interrupted Rick Perry's speech, leading to one arrest and theater full of Iowans trying to drown out the demonstrators' chants The potential candidates also warned about what they see as a dire path for the country, in particular when it comes to foreign policy, a theme that, along with immigration, also seems poised to become a flash point in the 2016 presidential race, unlike in 2012 Santorum argued that the growth of ISIS is a consequence of the isolationism and weakness from the Obama's administration  Cruz, like several speakers, said the President will fail in the war on terror if he refuses to use the words radical Islamic terrorism Huckabee blasted Obama for devoting more time to climate change in the State of the Union address than talking about terrorism  A beheading is a far greater threat to Americans than a sunburn, Huckabee said The issues There was plenty of the usual Iowa charm on stage, speeches with pig analogies and corn references  And there was more than one reference to how people in Iowa are somehow taller than average Shown on a big screen above the stage was an image of a red barn sitting on a green hill surrounded by white fences  Steve King's name — in all caps — was plastered across banners on the stage, as well as the podium The contenders also dished out a bevy of red meat, blasting Obamacare, Common Core, the media, Hillary Clinton and the $18 trillion debt  Cruz won huge applause for proposing to place 110,000 IRS employees on the southern border, joking that they'll do a better job at deterring illegal immigration than anything else Giving a shout out to the state's newly elected U  senator, Joni Ernst, was also a popular item on the agenda for the potential candidates  Nearly all of them referred to her as their friend, and almost equal amount of affection and time was dedicated to the state's other beloved senator, Chuck Grassley  The country would be transformed The reception  Several mentioned Fiorina as a surprise hit
