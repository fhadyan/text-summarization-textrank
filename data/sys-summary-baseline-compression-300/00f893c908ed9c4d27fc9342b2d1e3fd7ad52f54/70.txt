Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic once again faces two genocide charges instead of one in his long-running trial over ethnic violence during the 1990s Balkan wars Appellate judges at a U  war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands on Thursday reinstated the second genocide charge, ruling that the tribunal improperly dismissed the count in June 2012 Karadzic, whose trial began in 2010, also faces nine other charges related to ethnic violence during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s The reinstated charge accuses Karadzic of trying to permanently remove Bosnian Muslims and Croats from parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992  The charge was thrown out last year after the prosecution rested its case, with the tribunal ruling that there wasn't enough evidence for a genocide conviction on that particular allegation But the appellate judges Thursday ruled that the evidence of serious abuse against Bosnian Muslims and Croats including detaining them in overcrowded, squalid conditions where they were starved and left vulnerable to disease could be shown to be genocidal acts The judges cited allegations that Karadzic and officials loyal to him decided on a plan to rid Bosnia of Muslims, in part by killing a third of them and converting another third to Orthodox Christianity Thursday's decision came exactly 18 years after the notorious 1995 Srebrencia massacre, for which Karadzic faces the other genocide charge Nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in July 1995  Srebrenica became an emblem for the dissolution of Yugoslavia once a multiethnic state of Serbs, Croats, Muslims and others into six countries during a bloody and brutal conflict On Thursday, more than 400 victims of the massacre were to be reburied at a memorial center in Potocari in Bosnia and Herzegovina, adding to the more than 5,000 victims already buried there, the country's state-run news agency FENA reported Victims of the massacre have been buried at the site periodically as officials locate and identify more victims in mass graves  Sadness and pain, I have no words  It is so hard, said Fadila Efendic, who was set to bury her son Fejzo at the site Thursday, according to FENA
