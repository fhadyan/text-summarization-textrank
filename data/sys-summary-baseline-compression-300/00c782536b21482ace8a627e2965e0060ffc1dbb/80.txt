Well, it seems the U  Navy finally got the memo: DON'T USE ALL CAPS! IT'S RUDE! The Navy is switching to a new messaging system that's cheaper and more efficient And oh yeah, one that does away with a century-old practice: communications using all uppercase letters  Lowercase messages are here to stay; they provide a more readable format, a Navy news release said, citing James McCarty, the naval messaging program manager at U  Fleet Cyber Command The all-caps were a vestige of a bygone era Back in the 1850s, the teletype machines that the military used were made up of three rows of keys none of them lowercase letters Word of the change went out to all naval commands in April  But it didn't reach the rest of us until the news release this week In it, the Navy said it is ditching its in-house Defense Message System in favor of e-mail  One with a very apt acronym: NICE (Navy Interface for Command Email  The switch will save the Navy $20 million a year  And it gets them caught up with current Internet protocol Old sea dogs may feel differently
