 A spate of deadly shootings during anti-drug operations in Honduras including two in which U  agents killed suspects is linked to an aggressive new strategy to disrupt a preferred corridor for traffickers Operation Anvil, as the multinational mission is known, differs from past efforts because of its reliance on military outposts close to the front lines to provide quick responses  It is a strategy reminiscent of counterinsurgency tactics used by the U  military on battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan In a two-month span, six people have been killed in the operation, including possibly four innocent civilians Despite the controversial shootings, American and Honduran officials say they both are happy with their collaboration and consider Operation Anvil launched in April a success As of Wednesday, authorities said, they had interdicted five planes, seized about 2,300 kilos of cocaine, and made seven arrests  Firearms, including military assault rifles, have also been seized  The amount of drugs seized and the disruption of narcotrafficking routes speak for themselves, said Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro, the Honduran ambassador to the United States Meanwhile, critics in Honduras and the United States oppose the law enforcement strategy and question why American agents are killing anyone on foreign soil during peacetime The latest incident was just after midnight on July 3, when a plane carrying 900 kilograms of cocaine crashed in northeast Honduras not an uncommon occurrence in a region that is among traffickers' preferred smuggling stopovers Authorities descended on the scene, and when one of the suspected traffickers aboard the plane allegedly made a threatening move, two Drug Enforcement Agency officers opened fire, agency spokeswoman Barbara Carreno said  The suspect later died It was the second such incident in a two-week span  On June 23, a DEA agent shot and killed a suspected trafficker after he reached for a weapon, the agency said The pair of shootings by DEA agents follow an episode in May in which villagers in the country's Mosquitia coastal region say Honduran forces aboard American helicopters mistakenly fired on a civilian riverboat, killing four, including two pregnant women  official with knowledge of the incident said that the preliminary Honduran investigation, as well as a video of the incident, raises doubts about claims by those on the riverboat that they were innocent victims  The official asked not to be named because the a final report has not been issued  I think this is a disheartening sign of the escalation of U  involvement in Honduras without clear goals and guidelines, said Dana Frank, a Honduras expert and history professor at the University of California Santa Cruz  There is no clear oversight from Congress over what is going on, she said  It's not clear under what terms the DEA is there, operating in killings Anti-narcotics cooperation between the United States and Central American countries is not new, but Anvil represents a new approach to intercepting smugglers' aircraft Oliver Stone film revolves around drug war Anvil's major innovation is the use of military outposts closer to the drug trafficking routes, known as forward operating locations, for quicker deployment by Honduran police and their DEA advisers Anvil appears modeled after counterinsurgency tactics used by the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq, but the Hondurans say the suggestion to use the forward operating locations came from them About 600 American troops are located in Honduras, mostly at Soto Cano Air Base  Officials say they have seen a decreased role in Operation Anvil as the DEA team has stepped up, but a limited number of U  troops remain at the forward operating locations Joint Task Force Bravo, as the U  contingent is called, serves purely as a support element, providing re-fueling capability, communications infrastructure and medical evacuation capability at the forward bases, said Lt  Christopher Diaz, the spokesman for the group The forward operating bases are owned and maintained by the Hondurans, and they have operated them for years, Diaz said The helicopters used in the operations belong to the U  State Department, and are piloted either by Guatemalan military pilots who are on loan, or by U  contractors, said Stephen Posivak, spokesman for the U  Embassy in Honduras What's not new is the teamwork between the DEA and vetted Honduran police who participate in the operations, Posivak said  This concept is new, but previously there's been these type of bi-national efforts done by the Honduran government and DEA, he said Operation Anvil seeks to track planes entering Honduras, ascertains where they will land, and then sends helicopters out to make arrests, Posivak said Both governments insist that the DEA agents provide a supporting role only, and that under their rules of engagement are allowed to fire their weapons only in response to a threat The DEA is in Honduras at the request of our government in a support and training capacity, Hernandez said The three shooting incidents are the part of Operation Anvil that has received the most attention, but law enforcement aid is just one of the facets of American help Anvil falls within the larger framework of Central American Regional Security Initiative, or CARSI, which has provided more than half a billion dollars to the region since 2008  Besides law enforcement efforts, the money goes toward institution building and anti-corruption efforts, Posivak said Nobelists focus on violence against women in Central America  It's not a problem that can be solved by law enforcement alone, he said The goal is to address security concerns through all means, he said  funding for CARSI has increased from $60 million in 2008 to an estimated $135 million in 2012 The most controversial of the Anvil-related confrontations has been the May 11 incident near Ahuas in the Mosquitia region Hilda Lezama, the owner of the boat that was attacked, told reporters last month that she was carrying passengers before dawn when helicopters appeared and opened fire, wounding her and killing four The State Department, however, has indicated that the Honduran forces were justified in firing in self-defense  DEA agents were present, but did not fire their weapons, officials say The Honduran government is investigating the incident, but critics don't believe the government has the capacity to fairly assess itself  What happened in Ahuas is unbelievable  They claim they combat crime but they cover up their own crime? said Rodolfo Pastor Fasquelle, a Honduran historian and former minister of culture, arts and sports  For us who gain no benefit, these costs are unacceptable, Pastor said Posivak, the U
