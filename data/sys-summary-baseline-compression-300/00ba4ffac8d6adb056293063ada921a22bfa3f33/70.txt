 We don't know much about the shooting at Los Angeles International Airport just yet, but it has clearly jangled our collective nerves, dredging up the fear and shock and pain of 9/11 the wellspring of our modern airport security process reminding us that more than a decade later, flying is still a fraught experience For those of us who were working for United or American, that day in 2001 changed everything  When we finally got back onboard, our workplace now included air marshals, armed pilots, martial arts lessons, tasers, fortified cockpit doors, and a new focus on vigilance, not warmth and customer service  Welcome aboard was less a greeting and more an opportunity to size you up So, reports of today's airport shooting raise new fears about weaknesses in this system  Is it possible that the gunman who shot and killed one TSA officer and injured two of his colleagues may have made it through LAX security with a high-powered rifle? (As of this writing, that is not yet clear  And is it time to start arming Transportation Security Administration officials? No way I can understand the urge to react, to grasp at anything that might protect travelers  I too want air travel to be safe; hell, my husband is a pilot  But arming screeners at checkpoints well away from the airfield wouldn't be just another of the many precautions the airlines have taken to avert large-scale terrorism  It would simply be about protecting people from something that is everywhere in America: gun violence yes, at airports, and also at schools, at movie theaters, and malls If you're the kind of person who thinks that every teacher and hall monitor and mall cop and cinema usher should be armed, then you'll probably feel safer if we give guns to TSA officers  And maybe flight attendants and customer service reps and baggage handlers  And probably bus drivers and ballpark ticket takers, and hospital staff LAX shooting delays flights nationwide September 11, 2001, still hurts, but most of our public killings have been at the hands of angry or disturbed co-workers, students, neighbors, family members not terrorists Do you really want to start handing out guns to the people you work with? Probably not if you work for an airline where people are often underpaid, overworked, sometimes inhumanely exhausted and locked, perennially, in famously contentious relationships with management Even before 9/11, it made me nervous that as airline workers, we skipped security entirely, simply hopping off the employee bus and entering a back door, bags and bodies unscreened  I feared that the next air disaster would be caused by a colleague with a bone to pick I was never a fan of armed pilots, even in the nightmarish days after 9/11
