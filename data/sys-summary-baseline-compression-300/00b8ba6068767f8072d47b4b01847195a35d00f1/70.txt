 From personal stories of growing up with gay parents to challenges of what defines a family, the public's comments on same-sex couples having families was supportive and critical, calm and heated sometimes all in one conversation thread In CNN's documentary Gary and Tony Have a Baby, Soledad O'Brien follows a gay couple in their struggle through the legal and personal obstacles to become parents  We asked readers and viewers what they thought about gay couples having families  Whether they are gay as a couple, or gay as a single parent as long as they love and nourish that child it will make absolutely no difference  Compared to the atrocious things that we read here on CNN about what parents do to their children, being raised by a gay parent will be a blessing, says one reader  I work in a medical clinic and believe me, the large number of gay people/couples that we see are a helluva lot more 'normal' (and pleasant) than the straight people/couples!
