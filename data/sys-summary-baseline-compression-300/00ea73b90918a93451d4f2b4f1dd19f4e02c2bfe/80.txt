 Travel warnings from the U  Department of State didn't stop Faith Hentschel, 65, from venturing to Iran this May to visit the rustic sites in ancient Persepolis and the colorful bazaars in Tehran A photo of Khaju Bridge in Isfahan, Iran, taken by an American traveler  I had no idea what to expect, said Hentschel, who spent two weeks in Iran after booking the trip through a private tour operator and applying for a visa  I was stunned with the friendliness of all the Iranian people  That alone makes me want to go back Iran is still a relatively rare destination for Americans, creating a niche market for only a handful of tour operators across the nation that organize group trips for travelers once or twice a year  And with news of the arrest of three American backpackers, along with the June election riots and government crackdown, Iran may be an even harder sell, some travel companies said  It really depends on the political climate and the perception of Iran, said Mike McDonnell, who operates the site BestIranTravel com in San Francisco, California  The site books trips for non-Iranian travelers interested in visiting  His site saw a decline in booking travel to Iran this summer  It's already really hard to get to Iran in the first place Officials at the U  Department of State say travel warnings have been implemented on Iran since the hostage crisis in 1979, when militants captured 52 American diplomats and staff  The Americans were held for 444 days  Since then, the two countries have had no diplomatic relations  passports are valid for travel to Iran and visas are required to enter the country, according to the State Department Web site  Going with an organized tour group is the easiest way to attain a visa  Travelers who do visit Iran run the risk of being denied entry, U  officials say  In some cases, Iranian officials have prevented American citizens, academics, scientists and journalists from leaving the country, and even detained, interrogated and imprisoned some on unknown or various charges, the Web site said  It's made well-known that the destination [Iran] could be perilous for American citizens, said Darby Holladay, spokesman at the State Department Last week, three Americans were detained after crossing into northern Iran during a hiking trip  The two men and one woman, said to be seasoned travelers, began their trip in Turkey and went into Iraq before crossing the unmarked border into Iran  The U  State Department and the Australian and British government warn against traveling into the border zones  Obviously, we are concerned, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday to reporters  We want this matter brought to a resolution as soon as possible Mudhafer Mohammed, owner of the Miwan Hotel, told CNN that the hikers said they had come to the area because they heard it was safe  Mohammed said he tried to discourage them from going to Ahmed Awa, a popular tourist destination in the northern Kurdish region of Iraq  I told them, 'Don't go there because it is unsafe for you because you're American and Ahmed Awa is very close to the Iranian border Mohammed told CNN  It is unclear whether the three wandered into Iran accidentally or intentionally entered the country Pauline Frommer, creator of the Pauline Frommer's Travel Guides, said it's safer when visiting countries in conflict to use travel companies and tour operators that rely on local accommodations and guides  She warned against staying in big hotel chains, which have been targets in recent terrorist attacks in Indonesia and India  When it's an iffy destination, it's always a good idea to try and travel under the radar, she said  You don't want to be a target Despite worries about safety, demand for visiting Iran has grown in recent years  Last May, travel writer Rick Steves shot a 10-day video of his visit to Iran in a one-hour special that launched on PBS  The project cleared up misconceptions about Iran and sparked Americans' interest in traveling there, travel experts said At Geographic Expeditions, a luxury travel company that organizes trips to Iran, the number of participants doubled from 25 in 2007 to 50 in 2008  Spiekermann Travel Service, Inc one of the oldest travel agencies that specializes in Iranian travel, has booked more than 350 tours to the country since it began operating there in 1995  My path is known, said Ihab Zaki, owner of Spiekermann, which is based in Michigan  He said he began offering tours after he visited the country himself and was awed by its history and art  We send all our paperwork to local governments and they know we are coming  I don't let my people roam around in the middle of nowhere  It's very safe But the recent uncertainty in Iran has caused interest to wane  Spiekermann's bi-annual trips to Iran, limited to 14 travelers, usually sell out  But only four have signed up for the fall trip  Far Horizons Archaeological & Cultural Trips, Inc  in San Anselmo, California planned a second trip to Iran for October after their first trip in May sold out  But owner Mary Dell Lucas said the trip maybe be canceled because travelers are withdrawing  What's happening most recently is scaring people, she said  Those three Americans made a mistake, but with us, it's very different  We are taking a group, and we are invited Lucas' firm and other tour companies say they take precautions  Participants are required to abide by Iranian law, which means women must dress conservatively and cover their heads with scarves  A professor and a local guide, who are familiar with the country, accompany the American travelers 5 million readers in the U travel-security-and-safety
