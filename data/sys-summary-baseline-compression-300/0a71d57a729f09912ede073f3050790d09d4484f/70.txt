NEW YORK His was one of the first photos of a missing child to appear on a milk carton  Almost 30 years later, Etan Patz is still missing Etan Patz, who disappeared in 1979, was the first missing child featured in the milk carton campaigns of the 1980s Etan was 6 when he disappeared on May 25, 1979, the Friday before Memorial Day  He was on his way to school in what is now the upscale Soho neighborhood of New York It was the first time he'd walked to the bus stop by himself  It was just a few blocks away  Etan, like any 6-year-old, argued that all of his friends walked to the bus stop alone, and his parents relented His mother, Julie Patz, learned that Etan hadn't been in classes when he failed to return home  She called the school at 3:30 p m then called the homes of all his friends  When no one had seen Etan, she called police and filed a missing person's report By evening more than 100 police officers and searchers had gathered with bloodhounds  The search continued for weeks, but no clues to Etan's whereabouts were found  Watch an update on the case Â» The boy's disappearance was one of the key events that inspired the missing children's movement, which raised awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children  Etan's case was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s  In our minds there were only two possibilities, said Stan Patz, the boy's father  Either Etan was taken by a stranger and killed or he was taken by a very sad woman desperate for a child of her own, and we hoped that such a woman would at least take care of him and keep him safe Patz lived with this hope until 1982, when he learned of Jose Antonio Ramos' arrest and the surprising connection between him and a former babysitter of Etan's Ramos was a drifter who in 1979 lived in Alphabet City, a neighborhood not far from Soho  In 1982 he was arrested after boys in a neighborhood in the Bronx complained that he had stolen their book bags while trying to coax them into a drainpipe under a bridge, where he lived, said the Patzes and federal prosecutor Stuart GraBois, who spent years investigating the case When police found Ramos in his drainpipe home, they found he had many photographs of small blond boys  They noticed that they looked a lot like Etan Patz, according to author Lisa R Cohen's book about the case, After Etan: The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive Bronx police questioned Ramos, and he denied having anything to do with Etan's disappearance  But he did tell police that his girlfriend used to baby-sit for the boy, GraBois said Prosecutors in the Bronx and Manhattan pursued this lead, but concluded they did not have enough evidence to connect Ramos to Etan's disappearance, GraBois and a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said Ramos was released when the parents of the Bronx boys chose not to press charges against him, according to published reports  He left town and disappeared for six years until GraBois reviewed Etan's case  GraBois said he focused on Ramos as the prime suspect GraBois said he learned in 1988 that Ramos had been arrested and convicted of child molestation and was serving time in a Pennsylvania prison  Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights, GraBois said
