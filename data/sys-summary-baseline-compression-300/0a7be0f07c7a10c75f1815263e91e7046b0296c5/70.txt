It's a slick production with a nefarious goal: A 55-minute video released by ISIS, praising its victories and warning the United States from getting in the way of its goal to create an Islamic caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria It's propaganda, terrorism experts say  A recruitment video aimed at English speakers But the U  intelligence community is focused on one jihadist who appears briefly at the end of the video  The ISIS fighter, who speaks perfect English with a North American accent, is shown orchestrating the mass execution of a group of men It is too early to know if this militant hails from North America, or maybe spent some time there, or what his exact story might be But the intelligence community is already analyzing the video in an attempt to identify the man's origin, a U  official told CNN  It is too early to tell where his dialect is from, the official said In the video titled Flames of War, the jihadist first appears speaking Arabic in a classical dialect and with the ease of a native Arabic speaker, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said But the ISIS fighter who is masked and wearing a camouflage uniform seamlessly switches to English  There are a number of men digging a ditch behind him  The jihadist claims they are Syrian soldiers assigned to a 17th Division military base near the Syrian city of Raqqa, and who now, after an ISIS attack, are digging their own graves in the very place where they were stationed CNN cannot independently verify that the men in the video were soldiers, as the propaganda video claims How the 'Islamic State' is run, from oil to beheadings The video then shows a group of militants executing the men, who fall into the ditch The man who committed this atrocity on film could be an Arab who was educated in the West  Or he could be an American or Canadian  If so, Cruickshank said, he would be the first North American jihadist to commit a war crime on camera  Clearly ISIS had a calculated step to be able to put this guy on camera, said Frank Cilluffo, a security analyst at George Washington University  Why? Because he seems American  The message is aimed at a Western audience The intent, Cilluffo told CNN, is to project fear to Americans, and to project power The difference between ISIS and al Qaeda ISIS, ISIL or the Islamic state?
