It's called Godwin's law  The longer a debate rages, the greater the likelihood that someone will compare someone else to Hitler And Hillary Clinton has done just that: On Tuesday the former secretary of state reportedly told a private fund-raising party that Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions are similar to Hitler's in the run up to World War II Her quote (according to the Long Beach Press-Telegram All the Germans that were the ethnic Germans, the Germans by ancestry who were in places like Czechoslovakia and Romania and other places, Hitler kept saying they're not being treated right  I must go and protect my people, and that's what's gotten everybody so nervous Of course, what also gets everybody so nervous is leading statesmen comparing Putin to Hitler and, thereby, raising the specter of another world war It's unlikely that Clinton intended to gain politically from these remarks and they were carefully qualified  She added that there is no indication that Putin is as irrational as the German dictator was  But they could indicate that if she wins the 2016 election, America might gain a slightly more forceful president in foreign affairs, someone more willing to engage directly in Europe than Obama has  You may recall that in the 2008 primaries she was the Democrats' hawk candidate so much so that Ann Coulter preferred her to John McCain (Coulter called her our girl  But was Clinton right? Mostly no  It is true that Putin's justification for intervention in Ukraine is similar to Hitler's, that is, threatening to invade a sovereign territory to defend his ethnic brethren  But the situation is complex, and the historical comparison is tenuous at best Opinion: Has Putin broken international law?

Putin's ethnic Russian nationalists? Or the fringe of the ethnic Ukrainian nationalists? Neither is particularly pleasant Of course, the Ukrainian Nazi movement is small, and Ukraine is dwarfed by Russia, which puts Putin in the role of the dominant regional power picking on a small country and exploiting its extremist politics for the purpose of propaganda  But Putin is still no Hitler, because he lacks the German Fuhrer's global vision Opinion: Putin 2014 vs  Putin 2004 Hitler worked by an all-encompassing racist ideology that dreamed of turning Europe into a giant living space for his people  Even reckless
