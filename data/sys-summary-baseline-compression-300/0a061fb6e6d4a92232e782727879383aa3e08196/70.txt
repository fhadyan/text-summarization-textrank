 Egypt has agreed to allow two Iranian warships to cross through the Suez Canal in a move that puts the country's new military regime in a prickly position with its Israeli neighbor The post-Hosni Mubarak caretaker government gave the green light to the Iranian warships Friday, state media reported  They are expected to be the first Iranian warships to sail through the Suez since the Islamic republic's 1979 revolution The canal is an internal body of water, and as such, Egypt has sovereignty over it  But Egypt also is bound by the 1978 Camp David Accords, which guarantee the right of free passage by ships belonging to Israel and all other nations on the basis of the Constantinople Convention of 1888  Before that, Egypt did not allow Israeli ships to sail through the canal Last week, Egypt's newly empowered military government said it would honor all its international treaties  That would include Camp David  This is awkward at a minimum, said David Schenker, director of the Program on Arab Politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy Schenker said the Iranians had asked for a frigate the Alvand and a military supply ship the Kharg to cross into the Mediterranean  Both are armed with missiles, he said, adding that their passage would create more uncertainty in the region  It's destabilizing  It raises tension, particularly in this time of transition in Egypt, Schenker said  This is typical of Syrian-Iranian opportunism Egypt's decision, analysts said, could show the direction that the military caretakers intend to take the Arab world's most populous nation  It does raise an unwelcome political issue that has to be resolved, said Cmdr  James Kraska of the U  Naval War College in Rhode Island Iran said earlier that the flotilla was on a yearlong intelligence-gathering and training mission to prepare cadets to defend Iran's cargo ships and oil tankers from the threat of attack by Somali pirates, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency Asked about Iran's assertion that the ships are going to Syria for training, State Department spokesman P  Crowley said Friday, My initial response to that would be we're highly skeptical of that Asked whether he was concerned about the ships' travel plans, he said, It's not really about the ships  It's what are the ships carrying, what's their destination, what's the cargo on board, where is it going, to whom, for what benefit
