 These types of patients have such disfigurement beforehand they can't eat, they can't breathe properly  It's about functionality, says Dr  Richard Luskin, CEO of the New England Organ Bank Luskin is referring to the small group of people worldwide who are on waiting lists in hope of a new face, and in the United States at least, they may now have one donated to them more readily Last month the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS a non-profit organization managing the U  organ transplant system, approved the first national policies for the transplantation of limbs, faces and other structures collectively known as vascularized composite allografts (VCAs) which should make it easier to find donors As of April 2014, there had been 28 face transplants across the world  Animal attacks, severe burns and gunshot wounds had left these recipients scarred for life, literally, in the one place their scars cannot be hidden their face  Anyone with this disfigurement would argue they're not living, they're surviving, says Luskin Face transplant recipients: New findings A growing field The first face transplant was performed in France in 2005 on Isabelle Dinoire, whose mouth, nose and chin had been chewed away by her dog  Since then the field has grown and transplants involving varying combinations of facial parts have been performed in six other countries, including the United States As the procedures improve and their safety grows, donor registries and collaborating hospitals will increasingly be asking the question: Would you like to donate your face? Or in the case of the UNOS approval, asking family members of potential donors the sensitive question of whether they will donate the face of their loved one The UNOS approval will initially be in place temporarily for 15 months to enable public comment, but families of donors will receive extra guidance when it comes to making the decision  Face transplants remain unique and require very specific criteria such as hairlines and ethnic components, explains a UNOS spokesperson  Therefore consent should be distinct and individual  (This) will broaden the donor pool for wait-listed patients across a number of regional and national organ procurement organizations, explains Dr  Eduardo Rodriguez, professor of reconstructive plastic surgery at NYU Langone Medical Center  A major component for a successful procedure is patient selection on both the recipient and donor, he adds  The likeliness of a perfect match can be very challenging But this once-experimental procedure is becoming more widespread and accepted  Richard Norris, from Virginia, received a new face in March 2012 and last month his face was featured on the cover of the U  edition of men's magazine GQ  Norris lost most of his facial features after a gun blast, and lost abilities such as his sense of smell  But after surgery at the hands of Rodriguez and his team he can live his life once again Face transplant patients: Where are they now? Risk of rejection However, as this mode of surgery becomes a norm, the side effects and risks that come with the life-changing operation are still a concern and a question of ethics Like any other transplant, there is a risk of the new organ being rejected by the patient's immune system and recipients have to take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives, putting them at risk of infections and cancer  But unlike many other transplants, replacing a face is not a matter of life and death  The surgery is classed by some as life-changing, not life-saving, which raises questions as to whether this risk is justified  For heart transplant patients they need a transplant or they will die  These (face transplant) patients are not in organ failure but are having to take anti-rejection medication and have lifelong repression, explains Dr  Maria Siemionow, from the University of Illinois, who performed a near-total face transplant in 2008 on American Connie Culp, who was shot in the face by her husband But Siemionow is working to solve this problem  We need new therapies which will be less harmful, she says The Polish surgeon is developing chimeric cells, which bring together the cells from a donor and the recipient during transplantation  Not an easy task Luskin feels the benefits of a new face counter ethical doubts  He looked like a normal guy
