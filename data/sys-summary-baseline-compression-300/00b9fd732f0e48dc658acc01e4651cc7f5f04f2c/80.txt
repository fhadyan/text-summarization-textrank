 Jeff Yeager says the economic downturn is an opportunity for people to simplify their lives and be content with less More than 40 percent of the average household food budget is spent on eating out, says Jeff Yeager The author of The Ultimate Cheapskate's Road Map to True Riches has some ideas for saving $20,000 to $30,000 a year  The savings don't necessarily require sacrifices, he says, but rather choices that can lead to greater happiness Yeager talked with Heidi Collins on Tuesday on CNN Newsroom  A transcript of their conversation follows Heidi Collins: How did you become a cheapskate, if you will? Jeff Yeager: Well, you know, I'm about 50 years old  I grew up in the Midwest, and back then, spending money was really a last resort  We led sort of a simpler life, and I think, in a lot of ways, happier, Heidi  And that's really what I write about is, maybe there's a silver lining to this economic downturn  Maybe we can simplify our lives, be content with less and actually enjoy life more Collins: All right  As a fellow Midwesterner, I share your cheapskate thoughts already Yeager: You are a sister of the cheaphood  I knew it, Heidi Collins: Well, hey  I do wonder, though, as you've gone through this process, if you will, if you become the ultimate cheapskate, are you noticing now a lot more people kind of joining your club? Yeager: You know, they are  And again, I don't really talk about a life of sacrifice  I talk about a life of choices and how, in many instances, less can be more  Watch Jeff Yeager explain his savings suggestions » You know, in this economy, we hear a lot of stories about how to get more stuff for 20 percent less  I'm not saying that's unimportant  But maybe we're missing the real point  The secret to the time is being content with less Collins: OK  I like the way you talk  All right, so let's get to these five things, because that's what everybody really wants to hear about  Specifically, what they can do  And again, this is in order to save 20,000 to $30,000 a year  Really? Yeager: If these things apply to your family Collins: OK Yeager: And they are let me say in advance these are some fairly radical changes  But, again, it's probably not about sacrifice  It's about changing your life and maybe in the end being happier Collins: OK  Well, very good  First thing you say, give up your cell phone Yeager: Give up the cellulite life  I will use myself as a poster child  You know, I have a fairly successful career, a very happy life  I've never owned a cell phone, and nothing awful has ever happened Collins: Now, wait a minute  I've got to push back for a second, because a lot of people will tell you you can be happier with a cell phone because you're out of the office and you're with your family more, still able to still do business Yeager: We can debate all that, but 10 or 15 years ago, none of us had it, and nothing awful happened  It seemed to me we were really quite happy  Average cell phone plan costs about $100 a month  There's an interesting article in the recent Christian Science Monitor that shows the actual cost of using a cell phone could be more than $3 a minute by time you factor in unused minutes and so on Collins: Wow  All right  You say you might not need that second car and certainly not the third? Yeager: Americans own about 2½ cars per family  Can you give up one? The Auto Club says it costs about, on average, $1 a mile to drive a car by the time you factor in the cost of the car, depreciation and so on  So, you could easily be talking about $5,000 to $10,000 savings by sharing the remaining car that you have, using public transportation and so on Collins: OK  Give up meals prepared outside your home  Quit going out for meals no matter what, if it's just a salad or a fancy fancy dinner? Yeager: More than 40 percent of the average American family household food budget is spent on meals prepared outside the home  You can cut that by 80 percent by cooking those same meals at home and you know, maybe recapture some family time around the dinner table Collins: Yes, there would be people who would argue with you about that, though, too, because our culture is just so socially oriented to food  Every dinner, every business meeting, every lunch Collins: Yes, yes
