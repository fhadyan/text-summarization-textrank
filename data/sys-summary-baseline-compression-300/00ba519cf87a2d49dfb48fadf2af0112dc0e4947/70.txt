 Having established itself as Apple's top tablet competitor by going smaller and cheaper, Amazon will now go head to head with the category-defining iPad on its own turf Even as Google's new Nexus 7 challenges the Kindle Fire for dominance in the small-tablet category, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Thursday introduced a new, 8 9-inch Kindle Fire HD That pits the new device, which will ship in late November, against a device with which Apple has, thus far, squashed all direct competition  No tablet that has tried to match the iPad feature-for-feature has gained more than a token foothold in the market So, how do the latest version of the iPad and the Kindle Fire HD stack up? Because only a few people have gotten their hands on the new device, some questions can't be answered yet  But here's a look at what we do know so far: The Fire comes out way ahead on this one, as is to be expected from Amazon, which has targeted customers looking for the basic features of a tablet but not willing to pay Apple's heftier price tag For $499, the cost of the lowest-end iPad (the 16GB, WiFi-only model a buyer can get a 32GB version of the Fire HD with a 4G LTE connection on an upgraded cellular network The 16GB version of the Fire comes in at $299, or $200 less than the comparable iPad While Amazon obviously closed the gap significantly, the iPad still has a bigger screen than the Fire Apple's iPad screen measures 9 7 inches diagonally, while the Fire is at 8 9 inches  That's less than the difference between the screen sizes on the iPhone 4S and the larger Samsung Galaxy S III smartphones  (There's speculation the iPhone 5 will have a larger screen  But competition between Apple and Amazon could heat up on another front if rumors that Apple plans to release an iPad Mini turn out to be true Display Both tablets feature high-definition screens, although the details vary The iPad's retina display featured a total of 3 1 million pixels, with a resolution of 2,048 by 1,536  By contrast, the Fire HD measures 1,920 x 1,200 pixels, with custom features designed to reduce glare and improve color saturation Both Apple and Amazon boast that the resolution on their tablet is so sharp that it's impossible for the human eye to discern individual pixels Data plans Until now, the Kindle Fire has been a WiFi-only device, and some of its new models remain that way  But Bezos announced that the top-end version of the Fire HD is available in 4G The plan is offered at an attractive price of $50 a year  But that price gets you 250 MB of data per month not a lot for a device designed in large part to stream movies and other media It was unclear Thursday what the charges will be for going over the allotted data The $50 is well under what AT&T and Verizon charge for a year of data on the iPad When the first iPad launched, AT&T offered data plans starting at $15 per month, or $180 per year, for 250 megabytes of data
