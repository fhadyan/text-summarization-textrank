London, England Britain's Prince William and fiancee Kate Middleton made their first official engagement as a couple Thursday, launching a lifeboat in Wales The pair, who are due to marry in April, officially named the Hereford Endeavour lifeboat in a ceremony at the Trearddur Bay Lifeboat Station in Anglesey, North Wales  Middleton, wearing a Vivien Sheriff black-feathered beret, three-quarter length cream coat and suede boots, poured a bottle of champagne over the lifeboat after Prince William made a speech commending the efforts of the volunteers and rescue crew  We effectively have two launches today, said CNN royal contributor Mark Saunders  The launch of the lifeboat by William and Catherine and, at the same time, the launch of William and Catherine into this celebrity saturated world they are going to be living in Despite the modest nature of the event, hundreds of people turned out to watch the royal couple conduct their first official duty together  In 20 years of royal reporting I've never witnessed quite such excitement for such a single job, said Saunders One onlooker told CNN: It's lovely I would have thought more people would have brought flowers and things for them but it's lovely It's low key which is what he (Prince William) wanted It's the first public appearance the couple has made since they announced their engagement last November  It's a very low-key event, launching a lifeboat on the island where they both live it's a very good debut event for them, said Saunders  They have a very good relationship with the locals here, they are often seen at the local supermarket and buying wine from the local off-license  So for a first event, they couldn't have picked a better one The reason for such a low-key ceremony, says Saunders, is to prepare Middleton for life as a royal  (The royal family) have learnt many lessons from when Princess Diana first joined the royal family  Diana was just thrown in the deep end and absolutely given no guidance whatsoever  They're making sure this time round Catherine is well prepared, he said  Naming a new lifeboat is always a special occasion for the charity where we can thank our supporters and fundraisers
