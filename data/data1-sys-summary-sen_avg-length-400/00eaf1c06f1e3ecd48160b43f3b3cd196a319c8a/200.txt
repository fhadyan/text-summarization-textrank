Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes Its high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes and ultimately increase crop yields while acting as natural carbon sink - sequestering CO2 and locking it into the ground  Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere, said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar Worldwide use of biochar could cut CO2 levels by 8 parts per million within 50 years, according to NASA scientist James Hansen 5 ppm per year The process of making biochar can also lead to other valuable products Thousands of years later, the terra preta soil remains fertile without need for any added fertilizer, experts say Bibens' specialty is biochar, a highly porous charcoal made from organic waste Day says biomass that otherwise would be thrown away could be developed into entirely new markets for biofuels, electricity, biomass extracts and pharmaceutical applications, in addition to biochar
