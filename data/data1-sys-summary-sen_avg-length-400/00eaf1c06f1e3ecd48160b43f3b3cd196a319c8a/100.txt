Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes  See more about how biochar works Â»  Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere, said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar Worldwide use of biochar could cut CO2 levels by 8 parts per million within 50 years, according to NASA scientist James Hansen Bibens' specialty is biochar, a highly porous charcoal made from organic waste
