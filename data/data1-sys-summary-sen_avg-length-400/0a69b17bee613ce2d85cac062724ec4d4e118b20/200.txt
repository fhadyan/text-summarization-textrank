Kamberg, South Africa Sunlight sparkles through the drops of water that tumble off the edge of the cliff  Painted on the rock face behind the tiny waterfall are a pair of faded eland, the largest antelope in Africa Scattered throughout these mountains are some 60,000 individual images, visible at about 600 different sites  The artists used the blood and fat of the eland as well as whitened clay, bird droppings and charcoal as pigments  Behind them are two barely visible human figures Raphael has been coming here for years, and is now studying rock art through university, but the beauty of this ancient gift left behind by lost generations has not faded for him  This is a sacred place, says Raphael Mnkhati, a guide from the Kamberg Rock Art Center The tiny cave behind the waterfall is only one of thousands of such hidden, secret shelters in the Drakensberg-Ukahlamba Mountains of South Africa Read previous David McKenzie and World Cup in a Winnebago Today they are a vanished people, but their legacy remains in the vibrant paintings they left behind on the rock walls of their shelters
