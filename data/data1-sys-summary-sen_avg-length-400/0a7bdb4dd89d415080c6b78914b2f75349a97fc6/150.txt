New York Planned Parenthood of New York City blasted the city's new Teen Pregnancy Prevention Campaign on Thursday, saying it won't deter teen pregnancy and inappropriately shames and stigmatizes its target audience The campaign creates stigma, hostility and negative public opinions about teen pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering alternative aspirations for young people, said Haydee Morales, the organization's vice president of education and training  This campaign is part of the city's comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention program, which includes sex education, increased access to birth control and partnerships with community-based organizations, said Samantha Levine, deputy press secretary for Mayor Michael Bloomberg The city runs a school-based education program in which teen mothers and fathers discuss with peers the challenges of raising a child Since 2011, the city has mandated comprehensive sex education in public schools
