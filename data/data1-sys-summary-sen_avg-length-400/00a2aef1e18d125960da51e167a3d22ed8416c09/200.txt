But the future of the rescued children was unclear One woman told a local television station that she was willing to pay the police to keep her troublesome child  She said she would rather have the facility remain open, regardless of how it treated the children Many others, however, said they were in shock and disbelief over the allegations The school, Al-Arabiya Aloom Jamia Masjid Zikirya, which also was a drug rehab clinic, is in Sohrab Goth, a suburb of Gadap in Karachi All 14 boys were returned to their families, senior police official Ahsanullah Marwat told CNN Three people who worked at the facility were arrested, but the four men who ran the place were still at large, Marwat said Officials said the facility was part madrassa and part drug-rehab facility, and the captives were chained at night apparently to prevent their escape  The operation was successful, and we plan on continuing our work to ensure that places like this are shut down, Marwat said Many of the captives told police their families sent them there because they were recovering drug addicts
