Rakovich is an anti-abortion rights, pro-environment vegetarian living in Florida with her husband and nine cats  I do believe that there are times when we need the government to have some type of stopgap measures to help get people back on their feet, Rakovich said  Those types of people need help Many Tea Party activists believe she was one of the first people to publicly protest President Obama's economic policies In February 2009, Obama was in a Fort Myers, Florida, event hall pitching his stimulus plan  Rakovich stood alone outside the hall, speaking against it Nine days after Rakovich's protest, CNBC business reporter Rick Santelli publicly mounted his own campaign against the president's $75 billion plan to help struggling homeowners  It happened as Santelli reported live from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on February 19, 2009  The government is promoting bad behavior, he said in a tirade, claiming that all Americans would be forced to subsidize the losers' mortgages The stimulus bill had nothing to do with job creation whatsoever, Rakovich said in an interview with CNN last summer
