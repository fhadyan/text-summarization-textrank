I'm talking about breaking the habit of faking knowledge in order to save face How many times have I found myself nodding in feigned recognition when someone makes reference to a person or book they assume I know? How many times have I been guilty of unwittingly inflicting similar discomfort on others?  Politicians routinely face shame if they confess to not knowing Her students, anxious to deliver the right answer, would demand clarification  If her students protested, she'd say simply, That's all I know In other words, a whole generation of kids who've grown up with an emphasis on multiple choice testing, who've been taught that knowing the one right answer is more important than the process of inquiry, who've learned that admitting I don't know is a crime  But we won't ever achieve equity let alone excellence if we don't also work to make our schools places where we all feel safe saying I don't know  Pressure to know the right answer (or, more precisely, to appear to know) isn't limited to the classroom
