 Thailand's rice bowl is now Thailand's nightmare It was hard to imagine that last year, Red Shirts battled Yellow Shirts in deadly political street protests that prompted a state of emergency in Thailand and left a nation deeply divided Disaster brought them back together this week  But Friday, the river and its many tributaries eyed the capital, Bangkok, like a ferocious animal stalking its prey With 283 people dead and another 8 million affected by the flooding, the fears were real in Bangkok Monsoonal rains have flooded Thailand's plains and now the bursting river threatens to drown Bangkok The water was not raging  In two hours, they said, everything would be under water The water has already turned parking lots into marinas, markets into lakes and houses into homes suitable only for fish  Friday, he said he had moved into a second-floor company apartment in Bangkok, confident he would be safe there  Some wondered Friday how much worse it could get The government's Flood Relief Centre chief said that Bangkok would be spared In Bangkok and other deluged cities and towns, the strong carried the feeble on their backs
