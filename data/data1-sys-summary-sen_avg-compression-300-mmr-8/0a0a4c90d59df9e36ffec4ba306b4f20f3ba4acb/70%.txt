Critics of Zero Dark Thirty fear that audiences will accept as true the film's story line that torture was effective in eliciting information to locate bin Laden Peter Bergen: Did torture really net bin Laden?  senators John McCain, Carl Levin and Dianne Feinstein sent a letter to the film's distributor, Sony Pictures, characterizing the film's use of torture as grossly inaccurate and misleading  The senators bluntly informed Sony Pictures that it has an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden is not based on the facts, but rather part of the film's fictional narrative  Big business namely, the gas industry is aggressively objecting to the allegation in Promised Land that fracking poses environmental and health risks  They are wrong Energy in Depth went as far as to fact check a recent appearance by the film's co-star and co-writer, John Krasinski, on Late Night With David Letterman Regardless of whether Zero Dark Thirty and Promised Land intended to promote any message, people who watch them will be educated in some way on torture and fracking even if very subtly So go ahead, enjoy these films and ones like them that are based on actual events or current hot issues The first, Zero Dark Thirty, is about the pursuit and killing of Osama bin Laden, which features scenes of torture
