 Kyle White now has two pieces of metal to wear one, a bracelet inscribed with the names of his six comrades killed in an ambush in Afghanistan, the other, a Medal of Honor given to him for his valor that ensured that death toll wasn't higher Speaking minutes after President Barack Obama gave him the highest military honor, White insisted the two emblems are equally significant On Tuesday, White dressed in full uniform In an interview prior to the award ceremony, White told CNN how the group walked down this little incline and looking into the valley, (when) I hear this single shot  White was finishing off his first magazine and beginning to load another one when an rocket-propelled grenade exploded, knocking him unconscious  White administered first aid to one wounded soldier using the only cover available: a single tree It was at that point in the attack that White realized his radio wasn't working  White ran toward him, braving enemy fire White was able to drag the wounded man back to the tree White continued to risk himself to help his fellow warriors, again running from cover into enemy fire to reach the platoon leader  White told the military publication Stars and Stripes that he could see the leader's helmet and assault pack, but he couldn't tell whether the leader was alive  White had to see, he said White crawled toward the man White figured he would be killed  And I vow to live up to the responsibility of doing so, White said Then White found a working radio on a deceased comrade and called for artillery and helicopter gunships to help Finally, maybe, there could be hope  But then a friendly mortar round landed near White Speaking with National Public Radio this week, White said the experience from the violence to the wait seemed like forever  It's something you still think about every day, White said  he told NPR White first returned home and trained other paratrooopers Obama called him on February 10 to tell him he'd be given the Medal of Honor  Four service members received the Medal of Honor all posthumously for actions in the war in Iraq, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society As such, White couldn't help but think about his brothers in arms  Without the team, he said, there could be no Medal of Honor Read the transcript of the White House ceremony 24 minority veterans receive long overdue Medal of Honor See Kyle White's Army profile
