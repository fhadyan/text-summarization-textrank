ATHENS, Georgia Over the railroad tracks, near Agriculture Drive on the University of Georgia campus, sits a unique machine that may hold one of the solutions to big environmental problems like energy, food production and even global climate change Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes Biochar helps clean the air two ways: by preventing rotting biomass from releasing harmful CO2 into the atmosphere, and by allowing plants to safely store CO2 they pull out of the air during photosynthesis  Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere, said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar Worldwide use of biochar could cut CO2 levels by 8 parts per million within 50 years, according to NASA scientist James Hansen 5 ppm per year Thousands of years later, the terra preta soil remains fertile without need for any added fertilizer, experts say Bibens' specialty is biochar, a highly porous charcoal made from organic waste Day says biomass that otherwise would be thrown away could be developed into entirely new markets for biofuels, electricity, biomass extracts and pharmaceutical applications, in addition to biochar
