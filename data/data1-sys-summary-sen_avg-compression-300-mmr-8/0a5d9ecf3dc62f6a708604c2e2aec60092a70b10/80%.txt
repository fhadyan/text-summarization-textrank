 In recent months, Americans have experienced numerous extreme weather-related events, including droughts, wildfires and heat waves  In one recently published study, six international research teams led by scientists from NOAA and a number of countries investigated seven different 2011 extreme weather and climate events Among those events exacerbated by climate change were heat waves in Texas and Oklahoma, the East African drought and extreme temperatures in Europe and England Thirty-one states reached record-high temperatures One upward trend is indisputable: At NOAA, requests for climate data have skyrocketed, and those data are increasingly helping stakeholders cope with extreme events Businesses and governments depend on climate information to make smart investments At present we cannot definitively link any single extreme event to climate change
