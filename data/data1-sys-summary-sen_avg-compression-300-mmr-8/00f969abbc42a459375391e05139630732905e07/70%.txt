I believe Washington state has just played that pivotal role with regard to marijuana A public health model includes six key elements  Washington state's new law incorporates each of them  The Washington state legalization model assigns responsibility to a state agency for writing regulations concerning how the growing, producing and selling of marijuana will occur  Among those regulations are tight limitations on advertising and the prevention of access to marijuana by minors The second element is a well-funded multifaceted marijuana education program that is based on science rather than ideology  A key to good decision-making is possessing accurate information A fourth element is making treatment of marijuana dependence readily available  The new law dedicates funding to establish a statewide Marijuana Help Line  Using the findings of these evaluative studies, the state agency overseeing the pricing and taxing of marijuana can adjust those costs to maximize undercutting of the black market and deterrence of youth access to marijuana  Far too many adults don't take seriously enough the risk of marijuana dependence that accompanies very frequent use  By regulating and taxing marijuana based on a set of strong public health principles, I believe our cultural norms concerning marijuana will shift and the harms we've witnessed will greatly reduce  People of color will no longer face the egregious inequities in how marijuana criminal penalties are imposed  Roffman  In 1923, the state of New York repealed its alcohol prohibition law
