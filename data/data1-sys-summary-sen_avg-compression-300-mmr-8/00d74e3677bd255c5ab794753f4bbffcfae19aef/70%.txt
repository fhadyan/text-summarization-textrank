 Comprehensive immigration reform What's the most important piece of comprehensive immigration reform you never heard of? It's fixing the legal system so it works for the future for immigrants and the U  economy Many Americans think reform is about the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already living in the United States News: Possible compromise on immigration reform takes shape The root cause: For less-skilled foreigners who want to come to work legally in the United States, there is no line no available visas The two existing programs for low-skilled temporary workers are for seasonal labor only: farmhands, landscaping crews, summer and winter resort workers This wouldn't be a problem if we didn't need immigrant workers This isn't because American workers are somehow lacking or inadequate News: GOP needs to back immigration overhaul, lawmakers say In 1960, half of the native-born men in the labor force were high school dropouts happy to do physically demanding, low-skilled work No, we don't need as many immigrant workers in a down economy and far fewer want to come to the U Don't get me wrong: The goal of reform is not to increase the overall number of unskilled immigrants entering the country What's needed is to end illegal immigration by creating ways for needed workers to come legally creating worker visas and establishing a system that allows employers who can't find enough willing and able Americans to connect easily and quickly with lawful immigrants  Without it, there can be no successful immigration law enforcement  economy Finding a solution for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already in the country addresses the mistakes of the past but fixes nothing going forward The only way to prevent this: a legal immigration system that works Now if only Obama would mention it
