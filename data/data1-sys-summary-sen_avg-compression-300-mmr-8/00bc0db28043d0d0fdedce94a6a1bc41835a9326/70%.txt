 The inaugural addresses of the presidents are, for the most part, a wasteland of howling rhetoric and dried-out inspiration Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it Theodore Roosevelt failed  Dwight Eisenhower failed  Barack Obama failed the first time, and since second inaugural addresses are almost always even worse than firsts, it seems almost certain he'll fail again on Monday Why do inaugural addresses fail? They fail for two reasons: One subject to the speaker's control; the other, not They fail, first, because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric, even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments  Lincoln's two inaugural addresses stand (of course) as the great exception Consider, for example, this passage from Obama's first inaugural address:  Good writing can never come from bad thinking But there's another source of failure, one not so easily corrected  Inaugural addresses can fail even when the ideas are clear, even when the writing is fine, if the addresses make commitments that the ensuing presidency cannot deliver  Garfield Garfield was assassinated in September 1881, serving barely six months in office  Even had Garfield served a full term, his efforts would almost certainly have failed  We continue to quote a single sentence from Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural, a sentence from Ronald Reagan's first and a two-word phrase from Lyndon Johnson's  Garfield's noble summons went unheeded at the time and therefore inspires little interest now An inaugural address is a plan for what is to come  Even a good president can deliver a bad speech
