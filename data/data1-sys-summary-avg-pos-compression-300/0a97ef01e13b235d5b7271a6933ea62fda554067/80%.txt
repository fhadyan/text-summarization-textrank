 More than half a million people a year flock to the Blue Mountains National Park, Australia's most accessible wilderness, to see its impressive peaks and ancient rainforest.
 However, Randal Walker, chairman of Blue Mountains Tourism, argued that it is possible to develop sustainable tourism without damaging the natural beauty that visitors come to see.
  Although it looks gorgeous and beautiful it is a park under pressure there are a lot of vulnerable species in this national park, said Tara Cameron, a local teacher and President of Blue Mountains Conservation Society.
  I think national parks and nature is worth more than just being the new thing, the sort of new product, she said.
  Only eight percent is national park.
 Its tourism strategy has attracted criticism for refusing to rule out development within the park.
