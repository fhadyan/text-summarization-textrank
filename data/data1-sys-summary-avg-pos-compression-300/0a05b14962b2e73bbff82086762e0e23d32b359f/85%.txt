 Johnston was set to take part in a reality show in Alaska, she said.
  I do not believe that it would be in Tripp's best interest for Levi's reality show to be filming this case as it unfolds, or for Levi Johnston to be capitalizing off of this custody case through his reality show, Palin said.
 While Johnston said his former girlfriend would never be malicious toward him, her mother is powerful, politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive.
 Bristol Palin's affidavit said her mother is not involved in the custody case, except as a grandmother.
 Bristol Palin filed for full custody in November, but Johnston is seeking shared custody.
 Johnston has asked that the case conducted in public to protect himself from Sarah Palin, whom he said was powerful, politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive.
