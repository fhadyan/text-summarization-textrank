 Facebook is expanding its Gift feature to include plastic gift cards that carry balances for multiple stores and restaurants.
 The new product falls somewhere between store-specific cards and bank-issued open gift cards that can be used almost anywhere credit cards are accepted.
 Gift cards are an easy workaround for people who don't have enough time or personal knowledge to pick out a specific gift.
