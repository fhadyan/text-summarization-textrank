 Facebook is expanding its Gift feature to include plastic gift cards that carry balances for multiple stores and restaurants.
 The cards only work at four stores for now: Target, Jamba Juice, Sephora and The Olive Garden.
  It also offered gift cards for specific vendors such as Starbucks and iTunes.
 The new product falls somewhere between store-specific cards and bank-issued open gift cards that can be used almost anywhere credit cards are accepted.
 Gift cards are an easy workaround for people who don't have enough time or personal knowledge to pick out a specific gift.
 The cards will be rolling out gradually for Facebook users in the United States.
 Facebook is entering a crowded field and offers a couple of features to differentiate itself from other gift cards.
