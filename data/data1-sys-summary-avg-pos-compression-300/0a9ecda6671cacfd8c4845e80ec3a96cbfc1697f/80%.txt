North Korea has detained several Americans in recent years, increasing tension levels in what is already a rocky relationship between Pyongyang and Washington.
  One of the sources said the businessman had a visa to enter North Korea.
 The State Department is working with the Swedish Embassy in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, the officials said.
 Sweden represents America's interests in North Korea because the United States and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations.
