Why do inaugural addresses fail?.
  But in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.
  Inaugural addresses can fail even when the ideas are clear, even when the writing is fine, if the addresses make commitments that the ensuing presidency cannot deliver.
 An inaugural address is a plan for what is to come.
  Even a good president can deliver a bad speech.
 A speech can fail all by itself.
 Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it.
