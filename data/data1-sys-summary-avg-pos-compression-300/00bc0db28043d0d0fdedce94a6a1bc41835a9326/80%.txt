Theodore Roosevelt failed.
  Dwight Eisenhower failed.
 Why do inaugural addresses fail?.
 They fail for two reasons: One subject to the speaker's control; the other, not.
 They fail, first, because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric, even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments.
  But in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.
  The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history .
  Inaugural addresses can fail even when the ideas are clear, even when the writing is fine, if the addresses make commitments that the ensuing presidency cannot deliver.
  Garfield's noble summons went unheeded at the time and therefore inspires little interest now.
 An inaugural address is a plan for what is to come.
  Even a good president can deliver a bad speech.
  An inaugural address is a plan, and the test of a plan is the result.
 A speech can fail all by itself.
 Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it.
