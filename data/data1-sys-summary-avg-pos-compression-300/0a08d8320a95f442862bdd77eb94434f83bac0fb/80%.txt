Fourth seed Serena romped into the third round of the women's singles with a 6-2 6-3 win over Poland's Ursula Radwanska, whose older sister Agnieszka she beat to win her fifth Wimbledon title earlier this month.

 Lisicki also moved into round two of the singles, coming from behind to beat Tunisian teen Ons Jabeur ranked 297th and securing a match against Kazakhstan's Yaroslava Shvedova.
 The winner of that tie will likely face world No.
 Former world No.
