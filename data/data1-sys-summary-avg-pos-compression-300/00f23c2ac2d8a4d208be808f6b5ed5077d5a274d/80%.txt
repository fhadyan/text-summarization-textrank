In addition, Adam Dearman is indicted on three counts of Street Gang Act violations, and Garner is charged with theft by receiving stolen property and one Street Gang Act count, prosecutors said.
 One official described the offenses as a murder case and said no federal charges had been filed.
  Michael Burnett laid out the elaborate plot, telling a southeast Georgia court that he was part of what prosecutors called an anarchist group and militia.
 Roark, he said, was killed because he took money from the group and planned to leave.
 Four U.S. Army soldiers at Fort Stewart had already been accused of being members of the anarchist group, which was allegedly stockpiling weapons and bomb parts to overthrow the U.S. government, prosecutors said.
 The four men became part of a group that aimed to give the government back to the people, according to Burnett, who said that revolution was its goal.
 Prosecutors: 'Anarchist' group of U.S. soldiers aimed to overthrow government.
 It is not clear how capable the group was of carrying out the goals Burnett laid out.
 Roark and his girlfriend were killed because Aguigui felt the couple was a loose end, Burnett said.
  Adam Dearman is charged with three Street Gang Act offenses.
 In the third indictment, Joiner, Adam Dearman, Randall Blake Dearman and Anthony Garner are charged jointly, prosecutors said.
