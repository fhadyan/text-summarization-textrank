The teenager was out sailing Friday, de Lange said.
 Laura believes she will be able to convince the court that she is fit to make the trip alone, de Lange said.
 Laura said she has dreamed of sailing around the world since she was 10 and her parents are determined to help her achieve her goal.
  Guinness World Records confirmed the feat.
  He said he doesn't think age alone should determine whether Laura Dekker is ready for such an adventure.
 The court will then make a final ruling on whether her parents may have the final say about their daughter's plans, the court official said.
