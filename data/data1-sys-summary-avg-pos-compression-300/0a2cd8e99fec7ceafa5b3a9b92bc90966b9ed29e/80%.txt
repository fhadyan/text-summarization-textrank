 As a psychiatrist, former university president and advocate for Arab women in science, Rafia Ghubash is one of the United Arab Emirates' most influential women.
 Ghubash said her grandmothers' generation contributed far more to the politics, economy, education and literature of the region than has been recognized.
 Arianna Huffington tells women: 'Less stress, more living'.
  I want them to enjoy their culture and heritage, said Ghubash.
  My journey in life is very interesting, she said.
  Women here were empowered a long time ago, but haven't had a chance to tell our story, said Ghubash.
  Women here were not in the media, but they were economically engaged and running businesses.
