Tamir, who had what police said is an air gun that looked like a real firearm, died Sunday, a day after he was shot outside a recreation center.
  We are honoring the wishes of the family, Tomba said.
  It is our belief that this situation could have been avoided and that Tamir should still be here with us, the family said.
 Video shows officer shoot Tamir.
  (The officer's) door was open as they pulled up, Tomba said.
  He yelled three times as they pulled up.
 Police have said Tamir reached into his waistband and pulled out the weapon.
 Between 1.5 to two seconds elapsed from the time the car pulled up to the moment Tamir was shot, Tomba said.
  Twice the caller said the gun might be fake.
