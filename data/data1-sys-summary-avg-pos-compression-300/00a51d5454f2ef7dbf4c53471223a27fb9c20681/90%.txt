 Marco Rubio is all in.
 Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.
 Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.
  He holds little appeal to Latino voters.
  Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.
 Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
