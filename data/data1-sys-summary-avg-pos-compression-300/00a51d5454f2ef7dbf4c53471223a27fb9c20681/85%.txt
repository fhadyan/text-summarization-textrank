 Marco Rubio is all in.
  So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken.
 Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.
 Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.
 Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.
  Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.
 Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
