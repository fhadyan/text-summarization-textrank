 Marco Rubio is all in.
 Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.
  So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken.
  But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.
 Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.
 Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.
 Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.
 Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.
  Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.
 Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
