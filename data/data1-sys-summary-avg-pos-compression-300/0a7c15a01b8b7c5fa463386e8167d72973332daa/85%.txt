Leaders of Libya's interim government have said Gadhafi was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him Thursday.
  He said crowds beat Gadhafi in what was a humiliating end for the former dictator.
  More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi was shot in the head, dying moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, citing the city's coroner.
  Those who do not have blood on their hands must be made to feel safe and included, regardless of whether or not they supported Gadhafi in the past, she said.
  Taken together, these videos are very disturbing, he said.
 No foreign or independent officials were present, Zentani said.
