 Currently China's urban population is a little over 700 million people, said Tom Miller, author of China's Urban Billion.
  One in eight people on Earth will live in a Chinese city.
 Zhengzhou's population boom.
  Just a few years back, a new development zone, an adjunct to the main city, was labeled China's largest ghost city rows and rows of luxury apartments and office buildings sat empty on vast, deserted boulevards.
 But the city appears to have physically grown even faster.
 It would be another five or six years before this virtual city center would be completed, said a saleswoman named Song Lei.
 Asked whether or not she expected there to be enough customers to fill the giant office park, Song said, Altogether, probably not.
 Miller said the buy-up of property in China is further encouraged by the fact that unlike many Western countries, there is no annual property tax.
 But Miller challenges critics who quickly labeled Zhengzhou a ghost city.
 He said in the past few years city planners had constructed 14 new university campuses in the city, which he predicted would ensure a quarter of a million new residents.
