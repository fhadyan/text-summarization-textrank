 And maybe flight attendants and customer service reps and baggage handlers.
 Do you really want to start handing out guns to the people you work with?.
  Of course, I was wrong, and thankfully employees' bags are now screened, but giving guns to airline and airport workers is still a disquieting idea.
 Unquestionably, terrorism is a real concern for airlines, but like it or not, as Americans, we have also have to worry just as much about angry neighbors with guns.
 To fight our justified fear, some will undoubtedly push for more guns and others for fewer.
 No way.
