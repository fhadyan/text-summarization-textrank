 We were just professional cricketers.
 At the same time, a world away, South Africa was deep in the heart of apartheid.

 Many big-name West Indies stars were outspoken in their refusal to play in apartheid South Africa.
  I made the decision because I wasn't getting treated right as far as the West Indies (team) was concerned, said King.
  And I said to myself, 'Well, cricket is my job.
 More than just cricket.
  I knew the tour was more important than being just cricket, Stephenson said.
  I believe that cricket can make a difference, and I'm going to be a part of that team.
  But it was too late they were on their way to South Africa, to face apartheid head on.
  We packed them in, said Murray.
  It seemed South African fans couldn't get enough of the black cricketers from the West Indies.
 Even within the country itself, non-whites protested the West Indies rebels.
 The fate of their cricketing careers rested with the West Indies Cricket Board of Control.
  Their cricket careers came to an end.
 In 1983, the West Indies cricket team was on top of the world.
 And to this day, they hold strongly to the belief that being in South Africa in 1983 made a difference in disbanding apartheid, less than a decade after the West Indies players were there.
