 Federal civil rights investigators have found reasonable cause to believe that police in Portland, Oregon, use unnecessary or unreasonable force with persons who have mental illness, the U.S. Justice Department said.
  The city will move to speed investigations of complaints about possible officer misconduct.
 In the 42-page letter, federal officials outline remedies that include training and new policies to investigate alleged police misconduct.
  The city will revise its use-of-force policies particularly those regarding the use of stun guns to ensure that officers have necessary guidance when encountering someone with mental illness or perceived to have mental illness.
