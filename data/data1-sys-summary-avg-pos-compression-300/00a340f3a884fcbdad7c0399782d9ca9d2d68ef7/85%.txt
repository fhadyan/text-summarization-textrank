Petit is the sole survivor of the attack that killed his wife and two daughters.
  I lost my family and my home, said Petit.
  My wife, my friend, my partner.
 The two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation, while William Petit managed to escape from the basement, where he had been held.
 He said, I did not rape.
