 Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too.
 But the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network.
 We'll naturally make great use of Twitter and Facebook and all the other services, but it'd be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civic engagement.
  In fact, many of us have allowed companies to become intermediaries to all our communications, whether it was AOL 10 years ago or Facebook today.
  We can run our own Web sites, at our own Web addresses and keep control over how we communicate.
 That sounds absurd, but you can see advertisements today that essentially say Find us on Facebook at facebook.
 com/AcmeWidgets! .
 Now, Facebook probably won't fade away entirely, like early networks such as Friendster.
  And it is conceivable that the organizations and companies who communicate on Facebook today may want to become more independent.
 This is, after all, how the Web was designed to work.
  Because we'll have a web of independent but connected communications systems, just as the Internet was always designed to be.
