 So we thought Asian kids did great in school.
  Think again.
 The study highlights the pernicious nature of the model minority stereotype of Asians, and the fact that Asians are still viewed as the most foreign other in our American culture perhaps the biggest outsiders in the politics of not like us.
 And this lack of mentorship while in school may lead to an achievement gap in the workplace.
  Mentors and mentees are too often arbitrarily paired in the corporate world.
 Maybe then Asians in America can be recognized for bringing more to the table than just being good at school.
  But more surprising was the high level of racial bias against Asians and Indians professors were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these students.
  A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group.
