 Think again.
 The study highlights the pernicious nature of the model minority stereotype of Asians, and the fact that Asians are still viewed as the most foreign other in our American culture perhaps the biggest outsiders in the politics of not like us.

  But it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers in academia, the corporate world, public service, media, entertainment and the arts, whatever path talented young people might choose to recognize the subtle, unconscious biases that sometimes prevent Asians from achieving their true potential.
 Maybe then Asians in America can be recognized for bringing more to the table than just being good at school.
  But more surprising was the high level of racial bias against Asians and Indians professors were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these students.
  A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group.
