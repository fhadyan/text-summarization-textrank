Beijing Families of Chinese passengers on board missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have engaged in a rare late-night act of civil disobedience in this tightly-controlled city.
 Around midnight, more than one hundred relatives staged a pre-dawn sit-in outside the embassy gates.
  Their destination: the Malaysian Embassy.
 On several occasions within the last two weeks, Malaysian officials in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur publicly pledged to meet the Chinese families within a matter of 24 hours, but then failed to show up for talks.
 On Friday a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, Qin Gang, called on the families protesting outside the embassy to express their appeals in a legal and rational way while pledging to give them further assistance.
  And now we're going to the embassy.
