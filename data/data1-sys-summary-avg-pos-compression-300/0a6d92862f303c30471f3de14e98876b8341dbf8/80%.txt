For lovers of classical music, Vienna is a must-visit, as it was in the eighteenth century, when it attracted the young Mozart.
 For concerts, head to the Musikverein for performances by the Wiener Philharmoniker and smaller chamber concerts.
 STROLL.
 Vienna has a wealth of open spaces and parks, from the sculpted alpine gardens at the Belvedere Castle to the more laid-back, youthful feel of Danube Island.
 But that doesn't mean it's stuck in the past; Vienna has a youthful side, too, and is visited yearly by backpackers as much as mainline culture aficionados something Richard Linklater celebrated in his 1995 film Before Sunrise, which charted two strangers falling in love in the course of one day, with Vienna as the romantic backdrop.
 Places to stay in Vienna are plentiful and cater to all budgets.
