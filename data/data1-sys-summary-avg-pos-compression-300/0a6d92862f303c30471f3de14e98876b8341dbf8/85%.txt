For lovers of classical music, Vienna is a must-visit, as it was in the eighteenth century, when it attracted the young Mozart.
 STROLL.
 Vienna has a wealth of open spaces and parks, from the sculpted alpine gardens at the Belvedere Castle to the more laid-back, youthful feel of Danube Island.
  Alternatively, take a walk around the Baroque gardens at the Schonbrunn Palace.
 Places to stay in Vienna are plentiful and cater to all budgets.
 The Museum features Klimt's Beethoven mural, but to see his famed golden-hued painting The Kiss, head to the Belvedere Museum, housed in a magnificent palace built in the 1700s.
