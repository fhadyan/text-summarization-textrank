Lately, T-Mobile has been taking a bit of a beating in the U.S. market.
 Consequently, DT may not be pleased with what Sprint may be willing to offer for T-Mobile so who knows if this merger will happen.
 Wireless Week noted: T-Mobile currently markets its HSPA+ network as 4G but lacks the bandwidth to deploy LTE or WiMAX. Sprint and T-Mobile use different network technology and operate on different spectrum bands, which would complicate a possible merger of the companies' wireless services.
  So if the Sprint merger doesn't happen, T-Mobile does have options mainly leasing additional spectrum or access to other providers' networks, such as LightSquared, a wholesale-only wireless LTE network.
