Interactive: World AIDS Day and what it means.

 As a result of U.S. budget sequestration, the National Institutes of Health the engine of progress on AIDS research for 30 years will lose $229 million in AIDS research funding in the coming year.
 This hammer blow to AIDS research funding will be accompanied by cuts to a range of other HIV/AIDS programs cuts that will have negligible effect on the federal deficit but will have real consequences for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States and around the world.
