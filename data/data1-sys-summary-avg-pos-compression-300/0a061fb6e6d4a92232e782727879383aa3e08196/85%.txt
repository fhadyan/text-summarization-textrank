Asked about Iran's assertion that the ships are going to Syria for training, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Friday, My initial response to that would be we're highly skeptical of that.
 Asked whether he was concerned about the ships' travel plans, he said, It's not really about the ships.
 Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel's allies should pay close attention to the situation.
 The Israeli Defense Ministry said it was monitoring the movement of the Iranian ships and alerted its allies.
