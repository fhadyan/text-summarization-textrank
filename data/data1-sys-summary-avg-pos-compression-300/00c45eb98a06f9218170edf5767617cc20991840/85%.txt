 Ferguson is crumbling.
  The cowardly and reprehensible shooting Wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the Missouri town, which had already seen Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announce his resignation after a damning Justice Department report on its police department.
 Residents understandably want justice.
  If we don't press our police departments to reflect the makeup and needs of our communities, then towns like Ferguson will unravel further.
  But what's worse in all this is that Ferguson is illustrative of a broader problem across the country as increasingly militarized majority-white police departments demonstrate consistent racial bias toward majority-black communities.
