 When asked their reaction, Elliott said, I believe a little shocked that we were able to find them.
 Potter and Watson were still using the same vehicle, a 1980s blue Chevrolet pickup truck they drove from Ohio, Elliott said.
 Countless tips came in while they were missing but one in particular led to the breakthrough on Tuesday, Elliott said without elaborating.
 When she is returned to Ohio, Haylee will be placed in the custody of her grandmother, Elliott said.
 Potter was wanted on a state warrant for parole violation and a federal warrant for probation violation.
  Haylee was not on that video.
 Potter is a registered sex offender, officials said.
 Late Tuesday Haylee was in the custody of a children's protective services agency in the San Diego County area, Elliott said.
