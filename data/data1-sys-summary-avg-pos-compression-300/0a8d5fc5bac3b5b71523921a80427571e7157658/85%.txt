 I am very happy that my granddaughter's coming home, said Mary Watson, Haylee's grandmother.
  When asked their reaction, Elliott said, I believe a little shocked that we were able to find them.
 Potter and Watson were still using the same vehicle, a 1980s blue Chevrolet pickup truck they drove from Ohio, Elliott said.
 When she is returned to Ohio, Haylee will be placed in the custody of her grandmother, Elliott said.
 Potter was wanted on a state warrant for parole violation and a federal warrant for probation violation.
 Potter is a registered sex offender, officials said.
