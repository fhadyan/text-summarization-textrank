 It's a fashion designer's dream!.
  However, I think this was the first time I've traveled to India with a conscious intention to create a fusion of styles: their own traditional dress with my more modern, western creations.
  Everything is so full of intense color and I realized that, on a subconscious level at least, I've been influenced by Indian style In fact, when it comes to bold use of colors and the use of these rich, deep dyes, how can anyone deny the huge influence of India on fashion around the world?.
  This was the place to find all the accessories, textiles, ribbons, bows, buttons, and beads that I could take back to my studio in Auckland to use as inspiration for the final creations.
  I was born a fashion designer she says, and soon after she set up shop, her clothes acquired a reputation for their bold use of pattern and intricate stitching.
