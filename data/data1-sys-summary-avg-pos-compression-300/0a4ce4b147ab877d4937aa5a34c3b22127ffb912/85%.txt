LeJ has a long history of targeting the Hazara Shia community in Pakistan.
  The Hazara are numerous in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, and make up much of Afghanistan's Shia minority.
  In a subsequent open letter, the LeJ warned: We will rid Pakistan of [this] unclean people.
 The Taliban were quick to disown and condemn the attacks.
  Hazara leaders have already called on their community to remain calm and not to take the bait offered by these attacks.
 The first claim of responsibility for the bombing in the Afghan capital has come from a militant Sunni group in Pakistan with a history of sectarian attacks against Shia.
  The bombers wearing burkas killed 42 people belonging to tribes that opposed the Pakistan Taliban, also known for its antipathy toward Shia.
