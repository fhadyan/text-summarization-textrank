Either way, South Korean defense officials said on Friday they were sure that they came from North Korea and that they were up to no good.
 There is little danger the drones could have made it far into South Korea.
  They're just a militarized version of that, Hardy said.
 The Korean drones are nowhere near as sophisticated as those used by the United States in Pakistan, Yemen and Afghanistan, he said.
 North Korea has flaunted similar, larger UAVs at military parades in recent years, and some of them have been spiked with explosives, Hardy said.
 North Korea also warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device.
 And they made it through South Korean air defenses.
 They were launched in North Korea from three locations, South Korea's defense ministry said: Near the Kaesong area, 27 kilometers southeast of Haeju and 17 kilometers from Pyonggak.
 Kim said Seoul will send a warning via the United Nations to Pyongyang and tighten air defenses as a response to the drones.
 Photos the drones took along on their journey corroborate their flight path, he said.
 Precarious cargo.
