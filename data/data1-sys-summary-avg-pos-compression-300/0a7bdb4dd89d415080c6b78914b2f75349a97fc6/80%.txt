The campaign creates stigma, hostility and negative public opinions about teen pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering alternative aspirations for young people, said Haydee Morales, the organization's vice president of education and training.
 Since 2011, the city has mandated comprehensive sex education in public schools.
 Planned Parenthood said that it supports the initiatives and recognizes the importance of awareness and education, but added that the rate of teen pregnancies is affected by economic and societal factors such as poverty, violence, limited access to health care, as well as gender, racial and ethnic inequalities.
  Teenage parenthood is simply not the disastrous and life-compromising event these ads portray, it said.
 Some 41% of women who gave birth before 20 were living in poverty within the first year of their child's birth, while the chances of living in poverty rose to 50% when their child reached 3, Pika said.
