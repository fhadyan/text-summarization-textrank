Washington In the most extensive reshaping of the Obama administration's national security team to date, the president will name Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta as his nominee to succeed Robert Gates as defense secretary, top U.S. officials said Wednesday.
 In addition, Petraeus will resign from the military once confirmed so that he serves as a civilian CIA director, officials said.
 Gates was telling legislators and staff members that he recommended Panetta for his job six months ago, and joked that Panetta stopped speaking to him for days for doing so, the officials said.
 Gates is the only Cabinet member from the previous administration to stay on when Obama came into office.
  When asked if he would continue under another administration, Gates said in 2008, I learned a long time ago never to say never, so my answer is: The circumstances under which I would do that are inconceivable to me.
  But, he said, Obama impressed him.
  Holder said he believes that if a nominee is selected by May, the administration should have time to get the new director confirmed by August.
