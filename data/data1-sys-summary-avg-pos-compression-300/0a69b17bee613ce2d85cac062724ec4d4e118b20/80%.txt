 Painted on the rock face behind the tiny waterfall are a pair of faded eland, the largest antelope in Africa.
 Scattered throughout these mountains are some 60,000 individual images, visible at about 600 different sites.
  Behind them are two barely visible human figures.
  We are all from the same origins.
 The tiny cave behind the waterfall is only one of thousands of such hidden, secret shelters in the Drakensberg-Ukahlamba Mountains of South Africa.
  They were the home of the Bushmen, the original inhabitants of this country, who fled to these mountains to escape other Africans moving down from the north of the continent and white settlers moving up from the Cape.
