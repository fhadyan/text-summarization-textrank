Few details have been publicly released about how Anthony will be let out of the Orange County Jail, where she has been held since her arrest in October 2008..
 When exactly Anthony will be freed hasn't been made public.

  Casey Anthony had her day in court and the jury made a decision.
 What Anthony will do after her release is unclear.

 Anthony also still has legal issues to deal with.
  One is filed by a woman with the same name Anthony gave to investigators as the name of her daughter's nanny.
