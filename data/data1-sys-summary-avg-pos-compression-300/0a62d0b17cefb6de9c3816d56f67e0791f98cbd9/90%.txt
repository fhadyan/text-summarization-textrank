When exactly Anthony will be freed hasn't been made public.
 An Oklahoma woman said she has already faced the kind of ire Anthony may face when she's no longer behind the protective walls of the Orange County Jail.
  Casey Anthony had her day in court and the jury made a decision.
 What Anthony will do after her release is unclear.
 Hostin said on CNN that she's heard reports that Anthony will go into hiding, live under an assumed name or get plastic surgery.
 Anthony also still has legal issues to deal with.
  That is not just going to happen.
