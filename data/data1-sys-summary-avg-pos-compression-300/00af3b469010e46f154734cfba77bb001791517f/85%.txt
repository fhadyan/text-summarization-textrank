 Barahona said he didn't go through with his suicide plan because his son was with him, the document added.
  Mary Olsen said.
 Scott said the chemicals were so potent that staff caring for the boy at the hospital became ill as well, he said.
  She added, It's a complex case.
  The story was corroborated by interviews with the other two children in the home, officials said in court.
 The boy was hospitalized in intensive care with severe burns to his abdomen, upper thighs and buttocks, the affidavit said.
 Barahona told police he was distraught over the death of his daughter, and had intended to commit suicide by dousing himself with gasoline and setting himself afire, the affidavit said.
