SEOUL, South Korea The last bit of news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells into the sea near the border with South Korea.
 Disturbing news from North Korea comes just as often as stories that make us laugh in disbelief.
  But Pyongyang has launched deadly attacks.
 Those are two sides of North Korea deliberately frightening and inadvertently comical.
 North Korea is a Riddle Kingdom that is simultaneously threatening, bizarre and brutal.
