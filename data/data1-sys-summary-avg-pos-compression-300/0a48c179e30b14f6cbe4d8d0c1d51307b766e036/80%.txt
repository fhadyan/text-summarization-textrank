SEOUL, South Korea The last bit of news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells into the sea near the border with South Korea.
 Disturbing news from North Korea comes just as often as stories that make us laugh in disbelief.
 With its conventional and nuclear arsenals, North Korea manages to keep the international community, including the United States, scrambling for an approach that might neutralize the danger and send a lifeline to the victims of the cruel regime.
 Those are two sides of North Korea deliberately frightening and inadvertently comical.
 A yearlong investigation conducted by the United Nations found that North Korea is a country whose depth of brutality does not have any parallel in the contemporary world.
  Stories from refugees who have escaped from North Korea are a chilling reminder that the regime is not just a military threat, it is causing a terrible humanitarian crisis.
 North Korea is a Riddle Kingdom that is simultaneously threatening, bizarre and brutal.
