Opinion: Has Putin broken international law?.
 After all, in the eyes of many ethnic Russians, it is the Ukrainian nationalists not Putin who are the Nazis.
  Ukraine's new deputy secretary of national security is Dmytro Yarosh, leader of the Right Sector group, which regards Tyahnybok as a soft liberal and which flies the old flag of the Ukrainian Nazi collaborators at its rallies.
  But Putin is still no Hitler, because he lacks the German Fuhrer's global vision.
 Opinion: Putin 2014 vs.
  Putin 2004.
 Nevertheless, calling Putin Hitler is careless.
  Even reckless.
  It smacks, too, of the Manichean division of the world between good and evil that permeated the war on terror and led to so many terrible mistakes and so many American deaths overseas.
 Of course, what also gets everybody so nervous is leading statesmen comparing Putin to Hitler and, thereby, raising the specter of another world war.
