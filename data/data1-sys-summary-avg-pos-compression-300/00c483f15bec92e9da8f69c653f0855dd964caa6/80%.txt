 The passengers were evacuated from the plane on emergency slides.
 The slides were deployed on the left side of the aircraft, indicating that the problem was with the right engine, said CNN's Richard Quest.
 London Fire Brigade said one of its crews helped the airport fire service put out an aircraft fire.
  We've just been sitting, waiting in a plane meant to take off this morning, she told CNN iReport.
  The rain doesn't help.
 The airport is working to return to normal service as soon as possible, she said, but passengers are advised to check with their airlines.
