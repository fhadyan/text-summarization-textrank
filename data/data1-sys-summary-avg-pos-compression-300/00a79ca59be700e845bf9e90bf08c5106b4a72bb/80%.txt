Martin van Vliet, a researcher at the African Studies Center in Leiden, the Netherlands, said that while Timbuktu was no longer a city of vital economic or military importance, it stood out as an important prize for the rebels due to its symbolic significance.
  The group that controls Timbuktu controls the symbolic capital of the entire region, because it's that well-known across the world.
  If you control that city, it will be known.
  Laing stayed a month in the city, then was murdered two days after leaving.
 The city, today part of present-day Mali and known as the city of 333 saints for the Sufi imams, sheiks and scholars buried there, was made a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988..
  Timbuktu in the 14th to the 16th century was an important university city where many manuscripts referring to knowledge of astronomy, economy, religion, mathematics, physics, and medicine were produced, said Lazare Eloundou, chief of the Africa unit for UNESCO's World Heritage Center.
 He said the city's heritage was vastly important to locals as a source of cultural pride, but also of income.
  Timbuktu's outstanding earthen architectural wonders that are the great mosques of Djingareyber, Sankore and Sidi Yahia, must be safeguarded, she said.
