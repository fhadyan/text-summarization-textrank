 An official in Inner Mongolia is disputing an Amnesty International report that parts of the region are under martial law.
 The students were marching toward the building that houses the regional government, shouting, defend our land and defend our rights, according to the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center.
  The protests are a wake-up call for the authorities.
  There were no demonstrations or protests, Chao said Monday.
 The Amnesty report said Chinese authorities declared martial law in some parts of the autonomous region in an apparent response to days of protests.
