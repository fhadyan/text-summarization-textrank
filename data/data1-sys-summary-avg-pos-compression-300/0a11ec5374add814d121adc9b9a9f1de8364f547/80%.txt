The attorney said he'll file an appeal within a few days.
 However, the lawyer representing Ibrahim's family said Sunday that the mother is a devout Muslim.
 But the parliament speaker said that claims she was raised as non-Muslim are untrue.
 Ibrahim, who is eight months pregnant, is a Christian, her husband said.
 He uses a wheelchair and totally depends on her for all details of his life, said Jar Elnabi, her lawyer.
 She's having a difficult pregnancy, and a request to send her to a private hospital was denied, the lawyer said.
  But the court considers her a Muslim.
  I don't know what to do, said her husband, Daniel Wani.
