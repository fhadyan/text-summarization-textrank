AlKhamissi said it was too early to tell if life was improving for the middle classes who took to the streets during the revolution.
 He said: Some journalists have said that about my book, but it's nonsense to say that one book or 10 books can change reading habits.
 AlKhamissi said he dreams of an Egypt where taxi drivers could have the time and education to read his or any other book.
  I'm not interested in whether they read my book, I just hope they will read anything.
  A new post-revolution English edition has just been published.
  Twenty years ago there was nothing for 16, 17, 18-year-olds to read, said Towfik.
 Towfik said that despite Egypt's revolution, he still fears the scenes in his book, first published in Arabic in 2009, could come true.
  My taxi drivers are among the 55% of the population living under the poverty line of $2 a day, said AlKhamissi.
