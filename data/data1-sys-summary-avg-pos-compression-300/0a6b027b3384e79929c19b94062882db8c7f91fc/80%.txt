 Arsenal kept their slim hopes of winning this season's English Premier League title alive by beating relegation threatened Burnley 1-0 at Turf Moor.
 A first half goal from Welsh international Aaron Ramsey was enough to separate the two sides and secure Arsenal's hold on second place.
 Relegation dogfight.
 Good form.
 Arsenal have been in superb form since the start of the year, transforming what looked to be another mediocre season struggling to secure fourth place and with it Champions League qualification into one where they at least have a shot at winning the title.
