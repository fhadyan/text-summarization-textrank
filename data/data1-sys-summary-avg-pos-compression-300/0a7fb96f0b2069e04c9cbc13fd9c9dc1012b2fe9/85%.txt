With 283 people dead and another 8 million affected by the flooding, the fears were real in Bangkok.
 Some recalled the devastating 2004 tsunami that wiped out everything with walls of water.
  And panicked.
 The water was not raging.
  In two hours, they said, everything would be under water.
 The water has already turned parking lots into marinas, markets into lakes and houses into homes suitable only for fish.
  This is already the worst flooding Thailand has seen in decades.
 In Bangkok and other deluged cities and towns, the strong carried the feeble on their backs.
