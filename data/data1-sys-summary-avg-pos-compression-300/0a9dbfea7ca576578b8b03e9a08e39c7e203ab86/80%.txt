 This legislation is an unprecedented requirement for groups to publicly disclose their donors, stripping a protection recognized and solidified by the courts, said McConnell, who has advocated for more disclosure in the past so long as it applies to all big players in campaign financing, such as labor unions and trial lawyers.

 Democrats disagreed with the Republicans' assertion that labor unions are exempt from their legislation.
  However, the concern about labor unions appeared to sway key Republicans such as Sen.
 Opinion: Why Democrats need labor unions.
