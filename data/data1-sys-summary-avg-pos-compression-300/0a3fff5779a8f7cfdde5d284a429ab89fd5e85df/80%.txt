 Three months after the White House released a single photograph taken during a photo op of Air Force One flying over New York a flight that caused panic on the streets below the U.S. Air Force on Friday released the remaining 145 photos taken during the flight.
 The photographs show the Boeing VC-25 a military version of a 747 making three passes by the Statue of Liberty, at one point accompanied by an F-16 fighter jet and at another point making a steep bank not usually seen with passenger aircraft.
 The Pentagon estimated the cost of the flight at $328,835, which includes the Boeing aircraft and the two fighter jets that accompanied it.
 The VC-25 aircraft is designated Air Force One only when the president is aboard.
  Thanks for the heads up on sensitivities in the New York area, an Air Force colonel wrote in an e-mail two days before the flight.
