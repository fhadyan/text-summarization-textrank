KABUL, Afghanistan Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Sunday that his country would join the strategic review of the U.S led war on terrorism.
  We have to defeat terrorism.
 At the same time, Karzai said the actions of troops currently in Afghanistan have turned some of the public against them.
  It's the question of home searches, he said.
  What should have happened early on didn't unfortunately happen, Karzai said.
  President Obama is a great inspiration to the world, he said.
  The people of America have proven that they can really be the light holders for change and the will of the people in the world.
  Sure, corruption in the Afghan government is as much there as in any other third world country, he said.
  President Obama and Secretary Clinton and the United States government were very gratified to hear President Karzai reaffirm his support of the August 20 decision, Holbrooke said.
  U.S. forces will not be able to leave soon in Afghanistan because the task is not over, Karzai said.
