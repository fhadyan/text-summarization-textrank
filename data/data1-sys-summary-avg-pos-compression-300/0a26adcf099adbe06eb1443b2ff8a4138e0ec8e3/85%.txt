 Lester Hobbs and Aja were gone, Goss said.
 Goss said Lester Hobbs has an extensive criminal history but did not elaborate.
 Aja is 4 feet tall and weighs 59 pounds, Goss said.
 Her mother, Tonya Hobbs, 37, was found dead inside a parked RV Sunday night, the bureau said.
  Hobbs and her daughter were visiting Hobbs' estranged husband, Lester William Hobbs, at his sister's home, the bureau said.
  Lester Hobbs is not Aja's biological father, police said.
