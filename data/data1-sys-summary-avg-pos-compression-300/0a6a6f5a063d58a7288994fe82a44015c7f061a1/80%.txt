A Brazilian helicopter takes off Thursday from an airport in Palmira, Colombia, to pick up Sigifredo Lopez.
 The rebels had been training for months.
 A rebel camera was rolling as the 20-strong commando group drove a bus to Cali, Colombia's third-largest city.
  We are the FARC. .
 In 2003, Lopez and some of the other hostages appeared in a proof-of-life video.
 Another, Jairo Hoyos, sent a prophetic plea to the president: Mister President.
 Lopez was the sole survivor.
 FARC has released five other hostages in the past week.
 Four hostages three police officers and a soldier were released over the weekend.
 The FARC, the largest and oldest guerrilla group in Colombia, announced the releases December 21 and designated Cordoba as the coordinator.
 Colombia has said the rebels are still holding about 700 captives.
 He is the only one of that group who remains alive.
 A video taken by the FARC that day in April 2002 and released in late 2006 shows the first minutes of the bold kidnapping that led to his captivity.
