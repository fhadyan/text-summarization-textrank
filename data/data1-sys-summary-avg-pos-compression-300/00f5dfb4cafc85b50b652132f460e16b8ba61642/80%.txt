They will not bring more bodies up from the ocean if they cannot identify the two they already have, they said Thursday.
 Those two bodies are being examined to see if there is enough DNA to identify them, investigators said, adding that they hope to have results by Wednesday.
 The fuselage was discovered in April with bodies still inside, investigators said.
 Other relatives have called for the bodies to be recovered.
 The investigators also recovered two bodies from the fuselage after finding only about 50 bodies in the days immediately after the crash.
