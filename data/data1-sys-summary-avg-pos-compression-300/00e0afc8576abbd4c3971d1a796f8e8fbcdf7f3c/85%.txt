 As the world knows, peace can sometimes be fleeting.
  Ron Artest has contemplated the name change for years and always knew that he wanted his last name to be World Peace.
 The NBA suspended Artest for 86 games.
 Even before it was finalized by the court, World Peace was working on making the world a more peaceful place.
 World Peace was ejected from the game and faces possible suspension.
  It was unfortunate that James had to get hit with an unintentional elbow, World Peace told reporters after the game.
