 What's not new is the teamwork between the DEA and vetted Honduran police who participate in the operations, Posivak said.
  This concept is new, but previously there's been these type of bi-national efforts done by the Honduran government and DEA, he said.
 Operation Anvil seeks to track planes entering Honduras, ascertains where they will land, and then sends helicopters out to make arrests, Posivak said.
 The DEA is in Honduras at the request of our government in a support and training capacity, Hernandez said.
  It's not a problem that can be solved by law enforcement alone, he said.
 The goal is to address security concerns through all means, he said.

  Firearms, including military assault rifles, have also been seized.
  These factors are not favorable for long-term success, he said.
 Posivak, the U.S. embassy spokesman, said Operation Anvil has already proven successful at disrupting criminal organizations.
  We believe these interdictions have had a strong impact, he said.
