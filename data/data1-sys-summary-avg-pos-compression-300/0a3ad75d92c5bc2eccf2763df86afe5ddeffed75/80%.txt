TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras The de facto president of Honduras denied Wednesday that his government turned off the power at the embassy where deposed President Jose Manual Zelaya surprisingly reappeared this week, and said that the people inside were free to come and go.
 Micheletti said that other nations have not given his government a fair hearing of its position.
  Yes, we are alone, but we are surviving, Micheletti said.
 The organization said police fired tear gas Tuesday at a building housing a prominent human rights organization.
  Many were there to denounce what they said were police abuse while breaking up the demonstration outside the Brazilian Embassy, the rights group said.
  President Zelaya should present himself before the tribunals of justice in our country where he has charges against him, Micheletti said.
 As of Wednesday, power was restored to the building, Micheletti said.
 Micheletti said that the police were there because the people inside the embassy requested the protection, and said, We are not impeding the exit nor the entrance of absolutely anybody.
