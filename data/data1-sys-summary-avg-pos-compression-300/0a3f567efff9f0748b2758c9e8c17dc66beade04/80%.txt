 And he knows the White House.
  Rahm Emanuel has experience in the White House, on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill.
  Watch what Emanuel brings to the White House ».
  He has spent more time in the White House than President-elect Obama has.
  And most importantly, what I want to do as a parent, Emanuel said in an interview that aired Wednesday.
 Emanuel added: This is not a professional choice.
 Emanuel's at-times blunt approach would ensure the White House runs smoothly for the new president, said Mack McLarty, Clinton's former chief of staff.
  Watch as McLarty calls Emanuel an excellent choice ».
  So I think the years have been good to him in that regard, McLarty said.
 But David Gergen, a CNN senior political analyst who has worked in five administrations, said the contrasting styles between Obama and Emanuel could help the new president get things done in Washington.
  Barack Obama can be the good guy, Gergen said.
 Emanuel has made a career of being the tough guy.
 In the job, Emanuel would oversee the White House staff.
