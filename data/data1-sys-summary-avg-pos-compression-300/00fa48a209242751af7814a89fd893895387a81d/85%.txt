London, England Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup.
  The governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay.
 Delaney said the FAI had also written to the French football federation.
  This was a defining game with the whole world watching, and if FIFA believe in fair play and integrity, this is their opportunity to step forward.
 However, it said that under its regulations the referee's decision cannot be changed.
  He admitted he handled it, but it doesn't make me feel any better because we are not going to the World Cup finals, the defender said.
  FIFA will probably be happy.
  It was a clear handball.
  We're devastated.
  You don't do that, he told CNN. Henry was doing his job.
