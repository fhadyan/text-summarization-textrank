 Delaney said the FAI had also written to the French football federation.
  This was a defining game with the whole world watching, and if FIFA believe in fair play and integrity, this is their opportunity to step forward.

  He admitted he handled it, but it doesn't make me feel any better because we are not going to the World Cup finals, the defender said.
  FIFA will probably be happy.
  It was a clear handball.
