5 cool things DNA testing can do.
 Scientists have identified more than 2,000 single gene disorders, says Rebecca Nagy, president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.
  Testing for markers of risk scattered across someone's genome is really only testing for the tip of the iceberg.
 The upside of these at-home genetic testing kits and 23andMe isn't the only company that sells them is that they've generated a lot of buzz about genetics, Nagy says.
  She says she believes most early adopters of the tests are information-savvy and understand the results aren't set in stone.
 But Nagy says she worries about what will happen when the tests become more mainstream.
  Our message is to be a smart consumer, Nagy says.
  He eventually found he did indeed have two mutations, he says, but they weren't on the same gene.
  He says he submitted his bug report to the company and it apologized.
 Hartmann says he now believes he will not get limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, although he says there is a risk he could pass the genetic mutations onto his kids.
 Genetic testing can be a powerful tool.
