The suspect remained at large Sunday night, believed to be somewhere in the expansive park, Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Lee Taylor said.
 She is survived by her husband, who is also a park ranger, as well as a 4-year-old and a 1-year-old.
  She was a person with a quick smile, a very gentle person, a very competent ranger, said Taylor.
