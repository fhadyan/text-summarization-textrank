 For the first time since 9/11, the NSS integrates homeland security and national security, according to highlights of the plan given to CNN by a senior administration official said.
 Brennan, who made his comments at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that as the United States has strengthened its defenses against massive attacks like 9/11, al Qaeda has shown itself to be a resilient, resourceful and determined enemy.
 Brennan said al Qaeda is recruiting individuals with little training, attempting relatively unsophisticated attacks and seeking people living in the United States to launch such attacks.
 Homegrown terrorism represents a new phase of the terrorist threat, officials said.
