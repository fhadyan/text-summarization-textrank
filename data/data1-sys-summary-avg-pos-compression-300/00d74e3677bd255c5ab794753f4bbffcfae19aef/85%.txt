 Comprehensive immigration reform.
 What's the most important piece of comprehensive immigration reform you never heard of? It's fixing the legal system so it works for the future for immigrants and the U.S. economy.
 Many Americans think reform is about the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already living in the United States.
  And there are virtually no permanent visas to be had for unskilled workers.
  And we're going to need them increasingly as the economy recovers.
 This isn't because American workers are somehow lacking or inadequate.
 No, we don't need as many immigrant workers in a down economy and far fewer want to come to the U.S. when jobs are scarce.
 Even the best, most effective enforcement is no match for the dynamism of the U.S. economy.
  As long as there are jobs available, foreigners will want to come to work here.
 Now if only Obama would mention it.
