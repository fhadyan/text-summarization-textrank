 Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a key congressional voice on national security, announced Friday that he will not run for reelection this year.
 Rogers has said in the past that the phone and electronic surveillance programs were not abused and has stridently criticized Snowden, a former NSA contractor.
 Democrats sought to tie together Rogers and Boehner.
 Before Rogers became chairman, he issued an Intelligence Committee report on Iran's nuclear ambitions, authored a bill to protect against chemical and biological threats, and co-authored legislation reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, his Intelligence Committee biography said.
  That is why I have decided not to seek re- election to Congress in 2014. .
