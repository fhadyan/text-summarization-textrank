 A show featuring a lawman who makes jailed inmates wear pink underwear and uses actors to trick suspects, however, is a new twist.
 Dubbed America's Toughest Sheriff, Arpaio makes many of his county's 10,000 or so inmates live in tents.
  They were stealing the white underwear, smuggling the underwear out of the jail, Arpaio told CNN. So you know what? Give them pink.
  The other reason is they hate pink.
 Fabian said America's Voice is considering putting pressure on companies that advertise during Arpaio's show.
  I'm not going to brag, Arpaio said, but there isn't anybody in the world who doesn't know who this sheriff is.
  Sheriff Joe Arpaio now has his own TV show, Smile: You're Under Arrest.
