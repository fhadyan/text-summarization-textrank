Al-Mutawa and his team have now raised more than $40 million in venture capital for the project.
 According to Al-Mutawa, the criticism spooked The Hub.
  All of a sudden we couldn't get an air date and I was asked to be patient and we have been, Al-Mutawa said.
  They are just intellectual terrorists.
 But Al-Mutawa says criticisms of burqas are evidence that, for some people anything to do with Islam is bad.
 Al-Mutawa's frustrations are chronicled in the new documentary Wham! Bam! Islam which will air on PBS on October 13 as part of the Independent Lens series.
  One way or the other, he says, 'The 99' will get on air in the U.S. .
  It took off, although slowly, after Al-Mutawa raised $7 million from 54 investors across four continents.
