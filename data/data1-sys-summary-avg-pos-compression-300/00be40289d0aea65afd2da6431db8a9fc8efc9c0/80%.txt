  We would attribute a lot of that [bank robberies] to the growth and the fact that the banking industry has matched that growth with an increase in bank branches throughout the area, Emmett said.
 Atlanta's rise in bank heists comes just as Los Angeles has aggressively countered once out-of-control bank robberies.
 According to the FBI, its Atlanta field division reported 350 bank robberies in the last year the most notorious of which were the Barbie Bandits and Grandpa Bandit robberies.
 Here one of the so-called Barbie Bandits is captured on surveillance video at a surburban Atlanta bank.
  He also said bank robbers are often repeat offenders.
 Emmett says typically very little money is taken in a bank heist.
 He said customers want to come into a bank unimpeded that 99.9 percent are just customers, not bank robbers.
  he says.
 Emmett said as long as metro Atlanta continues to grow, so will the number of bank robberies.
  Two more armed bank robberies took place in metro Atlanta Friday.
