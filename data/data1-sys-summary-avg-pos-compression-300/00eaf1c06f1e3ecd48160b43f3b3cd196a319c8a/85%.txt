Biochar is considered by many scientists to be the black gold for agriculture.
  Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere, said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar.
