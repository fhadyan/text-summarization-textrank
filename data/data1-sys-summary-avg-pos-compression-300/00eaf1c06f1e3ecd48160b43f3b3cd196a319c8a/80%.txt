Biochar is considered by many scientists to be the black gold for agriculture.
  Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere, said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar.
 The process of making biochar can also lead to other valuable products.
 Although scientists look to biochar to improve the future, its origin lies in the past.
  These terra preta soils are older than 500 years and they are still black soil and very rich in carbon, said Steiner, a professor at the University of Georgia.
 Day says biomass that otherwise would be thrown away could be developed into entirely new markets for biofuels, electricity, biomass extracts and pharmaceutical applications, in addition to biochar.
