 I am very angry with China, said student Shohei Fukumoto.
 Yoko Sakamoto, 55, said Japan has been too easy on China.
  I 'd like to criticize Japanese government's weak attitude toward China and Senkaku Islands issue, rather than China itself, Sakamoto said.
  Senkaku Islands is Japan's traditional territory, Tamogami said.
 Tamogami called China a thief and vowed to protect the islands.
