Former White House spokesman Scott McClellan blasts President Bush and advisers in a new book.
 McClellan's former White House colleagues had harsher reactions to McClellan's book.
 In excerpts from a 341-page book to be released Monday, Scott McClellan writes on the war in Iraq that Bush and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war.
  I think the difference with McClellan's book is he's now telling us something we all know that the war with Iraq was a disastrous war [and] was sold with deception.
  It's a little different when you say something as I did and a few other people did four or five years ago, when the war was popular and when we were unpopular for saying what we said.
  Bush commuted his 30-month prison term, calling it excessive.

  Scott, we now know, is disgruntled about his experience at the White House, Perino said.
  This is not the Scott we knew.
