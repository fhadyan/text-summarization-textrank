Coalition strikes have not been targeting the Syrian government's military forces or infrastructure.
 So far, however, the balance of power has not shifted significantly either in favor of the government forces or rebel groups.
 ISIS has been pushed out of some territories, but is advancing in others.
 More fundamentally, the coalition's anti-ISIS campaign has deflected attention from the Syrian government and armed rebel group's atrocities against civilians.
 On a long term basis, the coalition strikes against ISIS in Syria will inevitably keep expanding, working to escalate the conflict.
 Military strikes are to some extent forcing ISIS fighters to retreat from territories under their control in northern and eastern Syria.
 Other opposition groups including the Free Syrian Army are unlikely to have the capability to take advantage of these strikes.
 The Syrian military is still superior when it comes to aerial force and may be best placed to retake ISIS territories.
