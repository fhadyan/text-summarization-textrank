 Jeff Yeager says the economic downturn is an opportunity for people to simplify their lives and be content with less.
  The secret to the time is being content with less.
 Yeager: Give up the cellulite life.
  You know, I have a fairly successful career, a very happy life.
  Can you give up one? The Auto Club says it costs about, on average, $1 a mile to drive a car by the time you factor in the cost of the car, depreciation and so on.
 Collins: OK. Give up meals prepared outside your home.
 Yeager: More than 40 percent of the average American family household food budget is spent on meals prepared outside the home.
 Collins: Yes, there would be people who would argue with you about that, though, too, because our culture is just so socially oriented to food.
  Less than 2 percent of clothes that we throw away in America are worn out.
 Yeager: And again, less than 2 percent of the clothes we throw away are worn out.
 Yeager: This is a big one, you know? Back in my day, if you have a child in school, consider having them live at home while they go to school.
