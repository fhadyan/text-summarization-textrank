 Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, known to many people more as an aggrieved movie character or perceived tax dodger than as an actual person, has finally spoken out.
  I can only speak well of Mark; I don't resent him, Saverin said.
 Saverin has had little to do with Facebook in recent years.
  The decision was strictly based on my interest of living and working in Singapore, he said.
  I already paid and I will keep paying whatever taxes I owe based on my time as a U.S. citizen.
  There was no other way.
 As for Facebook itself? Saverin still has his own profile, with more than 1 million people subscribed to it.
  But despite well-documented friction over the years, Saverin says he bears no ill will toward Zuckerberg.
