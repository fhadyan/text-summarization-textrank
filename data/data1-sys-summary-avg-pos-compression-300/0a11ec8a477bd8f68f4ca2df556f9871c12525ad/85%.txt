 Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, known to many people more as an aggrieved movie character or perceived tax dodger than as an actual person, has finally spoken out.
 Saverin has had little to do with Facebook in recent years.
  The decision was strictly based on my interest of living and working in Singapore, he said.
  I already paid and I will keep paying whatever taxes I owe based on my time as a U.S. citizen.
 As for Facebook itself? Saverin still has his own profile, with more than 1 million people subscribed to it.
