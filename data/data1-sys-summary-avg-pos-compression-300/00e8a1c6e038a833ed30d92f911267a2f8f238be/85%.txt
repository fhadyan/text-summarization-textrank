South African former president Thabo Mbeki is shown at talks Monday in Harare.
  The talks did not go very well.
  MDC have a proposal which is in conflict with the SADC and we opposed it and then the talks broke down, Mugabe said.
 The meeting had drawn the leaders of Mozambique and South Africa, as well as former South African President Thabo Mbeki.
 Tsvangirai blamed Mugabe for the failure of the talks.
