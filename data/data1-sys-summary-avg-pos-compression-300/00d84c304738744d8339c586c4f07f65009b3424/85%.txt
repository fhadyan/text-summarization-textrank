 Many 501(c 4) groups have interpreted this regulation to mean they can spend up to 49% of their funds on political activities mostly negative, deceptive political ads.
  As a result, politically active nonprofit groups spent more than $300 million on the 2012 election.
 With more and more groups seeking to participate in federal elections using money raised from donors who want to remain anonymous, applications to the IRS for 501(c 4) status more than doubled between 2010 and 2012. To manage the deluge, Lerner said the agency relied on code words and other shortcuts to single groups out for extra review.
  Nevertheless, Congress has shown no appetite to pass legislation clarifying the requirements for these nonprofit groups.
  Federal law requires these groups to operate exclusively for purposes beneficial to the community as a whole.
