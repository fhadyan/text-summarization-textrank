Pamela McNair said the family will continue carrying on James' legacy as a humanitarian, and the finances from the settlement will help.
  Little things that he's done are truly missed, McNair said.
  He was a great comedian, but he was a good family person first and foremost.
  He loved life and wanted others to love life as well.
  He was a humanitarian.
 McNair said her family has not been in contact with the Morgan family.
  It's kind of heartbreaking, McNair said.
  Walmart and the McNair family have worked closely together to reach an agreement.
