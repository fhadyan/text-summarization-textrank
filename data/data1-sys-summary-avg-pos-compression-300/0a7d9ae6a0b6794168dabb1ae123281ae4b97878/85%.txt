 We transitioned to a common boarding process across all aircraft, Hobart said.
 As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding.
 JetBlue offers families traveling coach with children under age 2 to board early, the airline said.
  So does Virgin America, which said it allows children under 5 to board early.
  Previously the airline had allowed earlier boarding.
  The airline does allow passengers with children traveling in first class or business class to board early.
