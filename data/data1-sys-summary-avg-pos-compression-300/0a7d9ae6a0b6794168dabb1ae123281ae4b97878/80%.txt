The policy change also has roots in the merger announced in 2010 between United and Continental.
  We transitioned to a common boarding process across all aircraft, Hobart said.
 As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding.
 JetBlue offers families traveling coach with children under age 2 to board early, the airline said.
  So does Virgin America, which said it allows children under 5 to board early.
  Previously the airline had allowed earlier boarding.
  The airline does allow passengers with children traveling in first class or business class to board early.
  If families do need additional assistance, our gate agent will work to accommodate them, Hobart said.
