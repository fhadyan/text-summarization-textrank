 We're trying to get this child buried with dignity and respect, said Tony Herbert, a spokesman for Dobson.
  The child appeared malnourished, the complaint said.
 King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch on December 17 and that she was the child's primary and sole caretaker until the time of his death, the complaint said.
 At a news conference Friday, Herbert said that Dobson lost custody of her son for financial reasons.
  She claimed she scratched the boy when she grabbed him and then fell on top of him, the report said.
  When they got up she stated that she slapped the child with a closed fist on his face because she was mad, the report said.
 In tears, she said, I love my son.
  He always gave me kisses.
  On the day she freed him, the complaint said, King allegedly beat him 12 to 13 times with a belt.
 King told authorities that the boy was being very difficult eating and that the last full meal he ate was on December 26, 2013; after that he would only pick at his food, the complaint said.
 After arriving at King's home on December 17, the complaint said, Myls Dobson lost 20 to 25 pounds.
  Each one of these tragedies, it's our job to try to stop, he said.
