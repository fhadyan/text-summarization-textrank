These are some of the contentious issues driving the presidential election in Taiwan this weekend.
 In 1954, the U.S. and Taiwan signed a mutual defense treaty.
 But all these years, Washington has avoided spelling out what it would do in case military clash erupts in the Taiwan Strait.
  Tsai for one rejects the 1992 Consensus and instead calls for a yet undefined Taiwan Consensus.
  There is no way China will keep the current level of talks if Taiwan claims itself to be a country, he says.
 Mainland companies, on the other hand, invested U.S 174 million into over 200 projects in Taiwan in the short time since Taiwan allowed mainland investments in June 2009, Xinhua said.
 Since Taiwan opened its borders to mainland tourists three-and-a-half years ago, says Shao Qiwei, head of China's tourism agency, over three million mainlanders have visited the island.
