These are some of the contentious issues driving the presidential election in Taiwan this weekend.
 In 1954, the U.S. and Taiwan signed a mutual defense treaty.
  Tsai for one rejects the 1992 Consensus and instead calls for a yet undefined Taiwan Consensus.
  There is no way China will keep the current level of talks if Taiwan claims itself to be a country, he says.
 Mainland companies, on the other hand, invested U.S 174 million into over 200 projects in Taiwan in the short time since Taiwan allowed mainland investments in June 2009, Xinhua said.
