The real estate developer and art lover donated $40 million, half made up from his private art collection, to the Pérez Art Museum Miami, known as PAMM, one of the few major institutions in the United States with a Hispanic name.
 The Pérez Art Museum had a smooth opening last year except for one slight hiccup: naming it.
  It seems they had their heart set on the Miami Art Museum.
  Some of the board members argued the name of the museum should represent the city's central art museum.
 When it comes to naming rights, perhaps Miami takes its art more seriously than science.
 But, she points out, naming Miami's art museum after Pérez carries a sense of pride for the Hispanic community, even though his art donation doesn't represent a collection.
