She said she knew Ford was in town and near her, and I said, 'I gotta go and talk to him and then I thought, 'That's foolish.
  I said, 'Maybe I'll take the gun and I thought, 'I have to do this.
 She said it never occurred to her that she could wind up in prison.
  Asked whether she had any regrets, Fromme said, No.
 Fromme was sentenced to life in prison, but parole was an option at the time, although the federal system later abolished it, said Felicia Ponce, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons.
 Fromme became eligible for parole in 1985, Ponce said.
 Fromme was not granted parole until July 2008, Ponce said.
  At the time, prison officials said they were looking into rumors that Fromme escaped after hearing Manson was ill, according to news reports.
 In the WCHS interview, Fromme said that Manson should not be incarcerated because he didn't kill anybody.
  If Fromme had killed the president, no one would have listened to her, he said.
  It's just hard to imagine how she got all caught up with Manson, he said.
 In the 1978 interview, Fromme called Manson a once-in-a-lifetime soul.
  She said she still corresponded with him.
  A prison spokeswoman would not say whether Fromme continues to correspond with Manson.
