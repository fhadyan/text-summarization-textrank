Miami The 9-year-old girl critically injured when an airplane struck her on a Florida beach last weekend has died, the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday.
 Kokomoor said that he was losing altitude fast and had little time to make a decision.
  He said he aimed for an area on the water's edge that appeared to be remote.
  I never saw them, he said.
 Venice Municipal Airport officials reported a plane in distress Sunday afternoon, sheriff's spokeswoman Wendy Rose said.
  Words cannot express the sorrow I feel, said a statement that was read by Willis.
