 The interesting news in the latest CNN/ORC International poll that Bill Clinton is pulling a 66% favorable rating among Americans suggests the 42nd president has the power to help or hurt Barack Obama as the 2012 campaign enters its final five months.
 Clinton is trying to change the debate in the presidential campaign from one about the past to one about the future.
  In 2010, working through Vice President Joe Biden, he urged Obama to make the case that the president had done a number of things to improve the lives of Americans in his first two years and suggested the president campaign on his record.
 Clinton isn't the first president to meddle in presidential politics after his own presidency ended.
