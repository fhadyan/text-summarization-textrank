 Data plans.
 When the first iPad launched, AT&T offered data plans starting at $15 per month, or $180 per year, for 250 megabytes of data.
 There are more than 225,000 apps designed specifically for the iPad.
 The 16GB version of the Fire comes in at $299, or $200 less than the comparable iPad.
 While Amazon obviously closed the gap significantly, the iPad still has a bigger screen than the Fire.
