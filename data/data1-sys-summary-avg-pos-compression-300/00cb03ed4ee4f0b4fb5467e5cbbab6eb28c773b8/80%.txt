The IAEA had released another report on Iran in September but this one was highly anticipated because of the military aspect.
 Since 2002, the IAEA has regularly received new information pertaining to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile, the report said.
 The IAEA said the some of the activities have both civilian and military applications, but others are specific to nuclear weapons.

 Rogers, R-Michigan, said new sanctions should cut off the supply of refined fuel to Iran and target its central bank, which he said is being used to finance Tehran's nuclear program.
  The agency has serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program, the report said.
