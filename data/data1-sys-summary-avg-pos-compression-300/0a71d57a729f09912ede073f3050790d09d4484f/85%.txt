 Almost 30 years later, Etan Patz is still missing.
  Etan's case was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s.
  GraBois said he focused on Ramos as the prime suspect.
 GraBois said he brought Ramos to New York for questioning and surprised him with the question: How many times did you have sex with Etan Patz? .
  Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights, GraBois said.
 Ramos is serving a 10- to 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania.
  He is scheduled to be released in November 2012, GraBois said.
 GraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison, and planted informants as his cell mates.
 Etan's case is still considered by the NYPD to be a cold case.
