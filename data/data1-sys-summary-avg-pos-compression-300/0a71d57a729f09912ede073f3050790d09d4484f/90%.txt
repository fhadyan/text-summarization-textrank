 Almost 30 years later, Etan Patz is still missing.
  GraBois said he focused on Ramos as the prime suspect.
  Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights, GraBois said.
 Ramos is serving a 10- to 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania.
  He is scheduled to be released in November 2012, GraBois said.
 GraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison, and planted informants as his cell mates.
 Etan's case is still considered by the NYPD to be a cold case.
