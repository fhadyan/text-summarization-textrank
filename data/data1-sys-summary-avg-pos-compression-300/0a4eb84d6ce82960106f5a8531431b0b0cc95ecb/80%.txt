In real court, however, the rules are different.
  Huth's attorneys should have complied with these rules.
  If they knew it was impossible to comply with the rules, then the attorneys knew when they filed the complaint that it was fatally defective.
 Cosby breaks his silence.
 Huth filed her complaint long after the time permitted by the statute of limitations.
 Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit.
  Her attorneys filed her Complaint naming Cosby.
  Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission.
 Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there.
  Huth's case illustrates that these rules are not merely procedural.
  But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.
 Cosby and his attorneys are not going quietly into the good night.
  They have filed a demurrer , which challenges the legal sufficiency of the claims or the complaint itself.
  A demurrer essentially says the complaint is so defective as written, that it should be dismissed His attorneys have also gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit.
