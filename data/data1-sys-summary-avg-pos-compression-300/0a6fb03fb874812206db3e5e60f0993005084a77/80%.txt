Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was hospitalized Sunday after doctors discovered a blood clot during a follow-up exam related to a concussion she suffered this month, her spokesman said.
 Reines did not specify where the clot was discovered.
 Clinton spent the holidays with her family last week after working from home.
