The European Central Bank, along with the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, said three U.S. dollar auctions would be held to help out European banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt.
  Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year, said van Dam.
 UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated.
 But the unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said.
 The loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading.
 UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said.
 There is a much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clients' exposure to investment banking losses, he said.
 He favors that alternative, he said.
  The banks are too large, van Dam said.
  We have only had three or four other situations in the billions, and that is exactly what happened, he said.
 The bank is large enough to take a $2 billion hit, experts said.
