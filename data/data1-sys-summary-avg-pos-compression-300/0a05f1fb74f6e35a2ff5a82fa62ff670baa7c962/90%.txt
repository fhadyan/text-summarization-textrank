  The bank declined to comment on the arrest.
  Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year, said van Dam.
 UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated.
 But the unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said.
 The loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading.
 He favors that alternative, he said.
  The banks are too large, van Dam said.
 The bank is large enough to take a $2 billion hit, experts said.
