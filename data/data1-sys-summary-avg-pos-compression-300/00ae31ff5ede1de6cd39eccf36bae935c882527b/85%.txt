 A three-year-old girl was sickened by a suspected melamine-tainted milk over the weekend the first known illness outside of mainland China.
 Investigators arrested two brothers who sold milk used to produce the contaminated baby milk powder last week.
 The raw milk had been watered down and the chemical added to fool quality checks, the newspaper said.
 Thousands of tons of the tainted milk powder have been recalled.
