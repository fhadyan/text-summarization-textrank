Trial 'will not bring back the dead'.
 Suffering under the Khmer Rouge.
 INTERACTIVE: Five faces of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge.
 This verdict regarding the two senior Khmer Rouge leaders matters a great deal to me, as should it for all Cambodians, because it gives some closure but closure is too little, too late for many.
  Then, they put me in prison.
 Surprisingly, the prison chief agreed and I was released.
 My experience is a mere footnote to the millions of other Cambodians who suffered and died at the hands of this regime, but it is illustrative of the ongoing struggle to find justice and closure.
