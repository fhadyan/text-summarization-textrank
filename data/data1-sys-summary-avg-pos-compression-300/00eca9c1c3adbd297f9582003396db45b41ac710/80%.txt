Hamilton's time of one minute, 38.673 seconds in the second session in Yeongam was about one-tenth of a second quicker than Vettel, the triple reigning world champion who has captured the last two races in Korea.
 Vettel admitted there was some room for improvement in his Red Bull.
  It will be close with Mercedes, he told Formula One's website.
 The only driver with half-a-chance of catching Vettel, Fernando Alonso, was a distant seventh in the second session.
