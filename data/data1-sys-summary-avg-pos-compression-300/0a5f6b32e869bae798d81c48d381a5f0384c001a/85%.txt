Australian FM Kevin Rudd resigns.
 Never before had the Labor Party dumped a serving Prime Minister, yet Hawke's equanimity outwardly at least was striking.
 Not so Kevin Rudd.
 It has been an undeclared, subterranean campaign to reinstall Rudd in the Prime Minister's office one from which the candidate has, until now, been able to stay aloof.
  Rudd has portrayed himself as busy and contented within the Cabinet under Julia Gillard.
 And in the resulting public imagery, it is not Rudd who is seeking to return to the Prime Minister's office; rather it is a semi-reluctant Rudd who is being ferried along by a group of ministers, MPs and Labor fixers who believe the only way that Labor can win against Tony Abbott and the Coalition at the next election is for Rudd to resume the leadership.
 Gillard calls for Australian Labor Party leadership vote.
 But Rudd had to be seen to be drafted by his party back into the Prime Minister's office.
 Hawker is now openly connected to the Rudd campaign's camp and helped advise Rudd that night.
 Tactically the day was a victory for Rudd; the leadership issue was out in public and now, sooner or later, it will have to be confronted.
 Should Rudd force a ballot? I don't know exactly how this is going to be played out.
