 That was about 50% of all the sugar produced in Uganda.
 Dawn of dictatorship.
  All industries collapsed, all international trade collapsed.
  Within a few years Kakira Sugar Industries had collapsed, but so had infrastructure in Uganda.
  Social services, everything had collapsed.
  The factory was a skeleton, Barungi said.
 Besides nearly 8,000 staff members, Kakira has almost as many contract workers in the shape of farmers, like Mwanja Banuli.
  The excess can go and work in other industries in the country, Barungi said.
 In Uganda, sugar is big business.
