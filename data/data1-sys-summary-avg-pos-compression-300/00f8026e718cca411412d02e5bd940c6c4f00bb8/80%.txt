Washington The much-maligned, color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System is about to be consigned to the proverbial dustbin of history.
  We will have to wait and see how they implement this new, more targeted system.
 President George W. Bush established the Homeland Security Advisory System by presidential directive on March 11, 2002, just a few months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.
 The initial level was yellow, which the system retained until September 11, 2002, when it was raised to orange to cover the first anniversary of the attacks.
 Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is expected to announce Thursday that the almost 9-year-old threat alert system will go away in April.
 The general threat level is yellow/elevated.
 Almost from the start, the threat level system was the butt of jokes and multiple parodies.
  Sometimes we disagreed with the intelligence assessment.
 The source did not provide details of the new system, which Napolitano will unveil at what the department is calling the first annual 'State of America's Homeland Security' address at George Washington University.
  Though the system served a valuable purpose in the terrible days and months following the terrorist attacks of September 11, it was clearly time for the current color-coded system to be replaced with a more targeted system, King said.
