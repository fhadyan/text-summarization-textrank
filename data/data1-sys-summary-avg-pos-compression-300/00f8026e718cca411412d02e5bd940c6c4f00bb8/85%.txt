Washington The much-maligned, color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System is about to be consigned to the proverbial dustbin of history.
  We will have to wait and see how they implement this new, more targeted system.
  The old color coded system taught Americans to be scared, not prepared, said ranking member Rep.
 The initial level was yellow, which the system retained until September 11, 2002, when it was raised to orange to cover the first anniversary of the attacks.
 Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is expected to announce Thursday that the almost 9-year-old threat alert system will go away in April.
 The general threat level is yellow/elevated.
 Almost from the start, the threat level system was the butt of jokes and multiple parodies.
  Though the system served a valuable purpose in the terrible days and months following the terrorist attacks of September 11, it was clearly time for the current color-coded system to be replaced with a more targeted system, King said.
