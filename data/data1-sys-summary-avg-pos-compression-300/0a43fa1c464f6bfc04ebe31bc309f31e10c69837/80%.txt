'The project is for the people'.
  The project is for the people, not just native people but everyone, Wilbur said.
  Letting them decide is central to the project, Wilbur said.
 Wilbur and Keene knew each other before Project 562 through their efforts in a larger movement in Indian country to change negative perceptions of Native Americans.
  Stereotypes in the media reduce Indian country to the Plains Indian in a headdress, said scholar Adrienne Keene, a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma whom Wilbur photographed for the series.
  She said it was a powerful experience she'll never forget.
 The concept of identity is fluid from person to person and generation to generation, Wilbur said.
  (Project 562) gives people an opportunity to see the diversity in Indian country and reframe what they think of when they think of Native Americans.
 She has high hopes for Project 562's legacy.
  The life we live is for the people, Wilbur said.
 The project is also building relationships in Indian country, cultivating bonds among Wilbur, the participants and also connecting them to elite institutions like the Tacoma Art Museum, Keene said.
