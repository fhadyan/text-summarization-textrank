'The project is for the people'.
  The project is for the people, not just native people but everyone, Wilbur said.
  Letting them decide is central to the project, Wilbur said.
 Wilbur and Keene knew each other before Project 562 through their efforts in a larger movement in Indian country to change negative perceptions of Native Americans.
 Taking Native American fashion 'Beyond Buckskin'.
  Stereotypes in the media reduce Indian country to the Plains Indian in a headdress, said scholar Adrienne Keene, a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma whom Wilbur photographed for the series.
  She said it was a powerful experience she'll never forget.
  (Project 562) gives people an opportunity to see the diversity in Indian country and reframe what they think of when they think of Native Americans.
  The life we live is for the people, Wilbur said.
