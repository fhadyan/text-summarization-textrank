 In September 1985 a devastating earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter Scale smashed into Mexico City killing 10,000 people and leaving parts of the city in ruins.
 Since then, the populous Latin American nation of 122 million has invested in one of the most advanced seismic warning systems anywhere in the world.
  He moved to Mexico City after working in Haiti and witnessing the devastation caused by the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck the Caribbean island in 2010 killing more than 230,000 people.
 It's called the Grillo (the Spanish word for cricket) early warning system.
 Meira also hopes versions of the Grillo system could be introduced elsewhere in the world where earthquakes are a real risk like in Nepal, India, the West Coast of the U.S. and along much of the Pacific Coast of South America.

 Warning app.
  This is our plan in Mexico.
  And that system, which consists of 1,000 GPS sensors.
 Now, they await the next earthquake.
 With roughly 21 million people living both formally and informally in and around Mexico City alone, that means many will not be aware the alarm is sounding until the ground begins shaking.
