Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that.
  I wake up, I go swimming every day, and I eat the same breakfast almost every single day.
 Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair.
  Because you know what? There's a hat, if your hair is really that bad that day.
  [Laughter .
  You know what I mean?.
 And people just think that bad flowers are better than nothing, but I disagree with that.
  You either have gorgeous, gorgeous flowers, or you have no flowers.
  That's awful, but it's true.
 Mizrahi: I don't know.
