Red Bull's four-time world champion has signed a three-year contract with the Scuderia, the oldest team in F1, from 2015..
 A return to McLaren seems most likely, despite his acrimonious departure from the team after just a single season as Lewis Hamilton's teammate in 2007..
 Since his full debut season for Toro Rosso in 2008, the German has won at least one race a year, not to mention winning four straight world championships between 2010 and 2013..
 The double move by two of the sport's high profile world champions is the most significant in the driver market this season.
 Which other teams have seats to fill?.
 There's also only one seat up for grabs at Toro Rosso, who will blood 17-year-old Max Verstappen as the youngest F1 driver in history next season.
 Junior Red Bull driver Carlos Sainz Jr is in pole position for the second seat and the Spaniard has been named as a test driver for Red Bull at the end of season test in Abu Dhabi although Toro Rosso may still retain French racer Jean-Eric Vergne.
 Sauber announced Swede Marcus Ericsson and Brazilian Felipe Nasr as its 2015 drivers in November much to the chagrin of current driver Adrian Sutil, who believed he had a contract with the team for next season.
