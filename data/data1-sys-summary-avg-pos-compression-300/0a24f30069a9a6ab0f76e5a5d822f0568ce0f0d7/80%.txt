 We have a long way to go, and not just in India.
  A World Health Organization global survey found that 59% of women in rural Ethiopia report being subjected to sexual violence from their intimate partner, 62% of women in Peru report physical violence at the hands of their partners and 30% of women in rural Bangladesh say their first sexual experience was forced.
  We can change.
  That starts by treating this moment not as some global airing of our dirty laundry but rather a national awakening to the reality that all of us girls and boys, women and men must do our part in cleaning it.
  But along the way, I've also met countless men who, given an opportunity, were willing to examine and improve their behavior towards the girls and women in their lives.
