 Washington canceled its plan for food shipments after Pyongyang launched a rocket on April 13..
 North Korea said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit, but much of the international community saw it as a cover up for testing its ballistic missile technology.
 No food aid is likely to come from the United States.
