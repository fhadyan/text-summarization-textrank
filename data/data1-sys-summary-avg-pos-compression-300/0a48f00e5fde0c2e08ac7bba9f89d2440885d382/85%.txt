 But if you're rich like Baldwin, why not hire someone to follow you around and record life as it happens? Go about your daily life, but have a trusted and well-paid photographer at your side, documenting just how rude, invasive, and aggressive the celebrity chasers can be.
 It may be too late for Baldwin, but not for other celebrities.
  Don't disappear from public life just to spite the paparazzi.
  It's time for a 21st century solution.
  It's time to fight photos with photos.
