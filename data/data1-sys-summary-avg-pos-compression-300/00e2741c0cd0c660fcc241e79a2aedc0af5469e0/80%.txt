Britain's Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is going back to work, taking on a new role as an air ambulance pilot.
 The duke will start training in September, a year after leaving the Royal Air Force, where he flew search and rescue helicopters.
 These were not a major issues whilst Prince William was a military search and rescue pilot because he was working in a remote part of west Wales and over water.
  He is highly skilled.
 The Duke has always been keen on a role beyond his royal duties whilst he is still second in line to the throne.
  He regards his work with the RAF search and rescue force as having been an exceptional privilege and the Duke wanted to make his own contribution to the outstanding work of the air ambulance service.
