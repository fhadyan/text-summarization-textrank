Britain's Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is going back to work, taking on a new role as an air ambulance pilot.
 These were not a major issues whilst Prince William was a military search and rescue pilot because he was working in a remote part of west Wales and over water.
 The palace said the pilot role would be the Duke's primary occupation.
