Osbon, who was been charged with interfering with a flight crew, has not made a public statement.
  A court official said Osbon was still under care Thursday.
  But his mother said on Thursday that he would reject the label.
  He just did what he was paid to do, Jean Beatrice Dowd said of Jason Dowd.
  I know he was thinking of her, too, at the time this was all going on, Dowd said.
 The incident has been earthshaking for us, too, she said.
 Osbon's stepmother said Thursday she has flown with him several times.
 Her stepson was upbeat the last time they spoke, she said.
  When Osbon said 'we need to take a leap of faith the FO stated that he became very worried.
