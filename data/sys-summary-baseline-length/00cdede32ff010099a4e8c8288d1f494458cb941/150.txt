Tokyo Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is investigating a report that workers at the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were told to use lead covers in order to hide unsafe radiation levels, an official said. The alleged incident happened December 1, nine months after a major earthquake and tsunami ravaged northern Japan and damaged the plant. "We'll firmly deal with the matter once the practice is confirmed to constitute a violation of any law said the ministry official, who could not be named in line with policy. The TEPCO official could also not be named in line with policy. The newspaper's report cited plant workers, who described the lead covers as fitting snugly over the dosimeters inside the breast pockets of the workers' protection suits.
