 Just when cruise lines thought they might be headed for calmer waters  At least 162 passengers and 11 crew members have reported being ill on board Princess Cruises' Caribbean Princess, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute said health officers would board the ship in Houston to investigate the gastrointestinal illness, which is causing vomiting and diarrhea. The news follows reports of sickness this week on another cruise ship, this one from the Royal Caribbean line. That ship returned home Wednesday, two days earlier than expected.
