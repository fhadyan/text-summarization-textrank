 The 54 men and 14 boys rescued after being found chained this week at an Islamic religious school in Pakistan have been reunited with their families or placed in shelters, authorities said. The group was discovered in an underground room with heavy chains linking them together. The school, Al-Arabiya Aloom Jamia Masjid Zikirya, which also was a drug rehab clinic, is in Sohrab Goth, a suburb of Gadap in Karachi. All 14 boys were returned to their families, senior police official Ahsanullah Marwat told CNN. Of the adults, 47 had been released to their families, and seven were handed over to a shelter for the homeless, he said. Three people who worked at the facility were arrested, but the four men who ran the place were still at large, Marwat said.
