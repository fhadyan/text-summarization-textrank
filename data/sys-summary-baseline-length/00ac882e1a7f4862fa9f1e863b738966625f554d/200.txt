 I'm Candida Moss and I am professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame. I was an adviser on the "True Cross" episode and served as one of the many on-camera experts in CNN's "Finding Jesus" series, which currently airs on Sundays. Viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the "Finding Jesus" Facebook page during the show. Below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them. My apologies to everyone I didn't get to. Feel free to tweet your questions to me directly. Herb Scribner: Can anyone explain to me what the Bible's deal is with 40 days/nights? Yalanda M. Price: Was there any division between the followers of Jesus and the followers of John the Baptist? Mark Goodacre answers your questions about the Shroud of Turin. Jeffery Graff: Can the DNA tests on the bones indicate whether he is a Jew or even whether he is of the tribe of Levi? Watch the latest full episode anytime on CNNgo
