 Be bold! Think big! Barack Obama wants to do just that. An $800 billion economic stimulus plan. Three million jobs. Health care reform. A restructured automobile industry. Obama's popularity with voters will win him influence with political opponents. Just this: the U.S. system of government. It is set up to make it difficult to get things done. So they set up a system with an elaborate separation of powers. The idea was to ensure weak government. Here, the people rule.
