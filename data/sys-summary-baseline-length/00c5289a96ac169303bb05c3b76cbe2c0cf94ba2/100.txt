San Angelo, Texas The Texas jury that found polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs guilty Thursday of sexual assault will deliberate again to determine his punishment. Jeffs, who represented himself after firing his defense team, remained stoic as the verdict was read. Jurors will decide his fate after hearing additional witness testimony in the penalty phase of the trial, which began Thursday evening and will continue Friday. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott hailed the verdict and said prosecutors were seeking a life sentence for Jeffs.
