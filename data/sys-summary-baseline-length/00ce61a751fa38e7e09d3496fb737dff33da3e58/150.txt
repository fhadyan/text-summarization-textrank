 The melting glacial ice in places like the Alps, Greenland and the Himalayas is a dramatic visual document of how our planet's climate is changing. For U.S based environmental photographer James Balog, it is a vision he has spent more than six years trying to record and preserve. After an assignment for National Geographic in Iceland in 2005, he was shocked by the changes taking place and wanted to find a way to capture what was going on, in the Arctic and glaciers elsewhere around the world. Balog says putting the documentary together has changed his initial skepticism about climate change. Watch: CNN special 'Secrets in the Ice' Balog, who lives in the Rocky Mountains near Boulder, Colorado, believes the economic and technological solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change already exist.
