 For the second time during his papacy, Pope Francis has announced a new group of bishops and archbishops set to become cardinals and they come from all over the world. Pope Francis said Sunday that he would hold a meeting of cardinals on February 14 "during which I will name 15 new Cardinals who, coming from 13 countries from every continent, manifest the indissoluble links between the Church of Rome and the particular Churches present in the world according to Vatican Radio. New cardinals are always important because they set the tone in the church and also elect the next pope, CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John L. Allen said. They are sometimes referred to as the princes of the Catholic Church. The new cardinals come from countries such as Ethiopia, New Zealand and Myanmar. But for the second time since Francis' election, no Americans made the list. "Francis' pattern is very clear: He wants to go to the geographical peripheries rather than places that are already top-heavy with cardinals Allen said.
