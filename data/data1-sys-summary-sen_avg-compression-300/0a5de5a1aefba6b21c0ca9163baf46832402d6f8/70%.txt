A Cleveland police officer shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice about two seconds after the officer and a partner pulled up in a car to investigate reports that someone was brandishing a gun at a park, surveillance video that police released Wednesday shows.
 Tamir, who had what police said is an air gun that looked like a real firearm, died Sunday, a day after he was shot outside a recreation center.
 Video shows officer shoot Tamir.
 One of the officers the one in the passenger seat told Tamir three times to show your hands, Tomba told reporters.
  (The officer's) door was open as they pulled up, Tomba said.
 Police have said Tamir reached into his waistband and pulled out the weapon.
  The video shows Loehmann, the passenger-side officer, exiting the car, and Tamir falls down, apparently shot.
 Between 1.5 to two seconds elapsed from the time the car pulled up to the moment Tamir was shot, Tomba said.
 Chief Calvin Williams said that four minutes after Tamir was shot a detective and FBI agent were on the scene.
  Twice the caller said the gun might be fake.
 Loehmann joined the department in March, Tomba said.
