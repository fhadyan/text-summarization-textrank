Coalition strikes have not been targeting the Syrian government's military forces or infrastructure.
 Although government forces have made slight advances in Aleppo, resource constraints have prevented the military from taking full advantage of the coalition strikes.
 Civilian suffering.
 More fundamentally, the coalition's anti-ISIS campaign has deflected attention from the Syrian government and armed rebel group's atrocities against civilians.
 Late last month, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said that without U.N. Security Council approval, the U.S. strikes lacked legitimacy.
 Tackling the disease.
 On a long term basis, the coalition strikes against ISIS in Syria will inevitably keep expanding, working to escalate the conflict.
 A strategic shift to target the Syrian government's military infrastructure is unlikely as many regional and international state actors have a stake in Syria.
 Coalition training may gradually improve some of the Syrian rebel groups' military capabilities and strategic planning but the current balance of power between the government forces and various rebel and armed groups will likely continue.
 Military strikes are to some extent forcing ISIS fighters to retreat from territories under their control in northern and eastern Syria.
 Other opposition groups including the Free Syrian Army are unlikely to have the capability to take advantage of these strikes.
 The Syrian military is still superior when it comes to aerial force and may be best placed to retake ISIS territories.
