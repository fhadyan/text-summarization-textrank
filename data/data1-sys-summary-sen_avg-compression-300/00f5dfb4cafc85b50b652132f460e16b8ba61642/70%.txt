Paris Investigators trying to determine why an Air France plane crashed mysteriously two years ago have recovered the complete contents of the flight data recorder and the last two hours of cockpit conversation, they announced Monday.
 It will take several weeks to analyze the data, French air accident experts said.
 Those two bodies are being examined to see if there is enough DNA to identify them, investigators said, adding that they hope to have results by Wednesday.
 Investigators also brought an engine and an avionics bay containing computers to the surface, they said.
 The pilots of Air France 447 lost contact with air traffic controllers on June 1, 2009, while flying across an area of the Atlantic known for severe turbulence, officials said.
 The fuselage was discovered in April with bodies still inside, investigators said.
  The cause of the crash is still not known.
