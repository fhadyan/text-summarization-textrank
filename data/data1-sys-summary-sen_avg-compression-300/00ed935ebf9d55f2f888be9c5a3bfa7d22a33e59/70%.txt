John Edward Jones, 26, of Stansbury Park was stuck in the Nutty Putty Cave, which sits west of Utah Lake near Cedar Valley, according to the sheriff's office of Utah County.
  Rescue officials were meeting Thursday to determine how to recover Jones' body.
 Rescuers had tried to reach Jones for more than 24 hours, but had problems navigating the treacherous terrain, Cannon said.
  Getting people to him is very difficult, Cannon told KSL before Jones died.
  It is a tightly confined space.
 Sheriff's officials said Jones entered the cave at around 6 p.
