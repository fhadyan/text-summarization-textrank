 ET Thursday, History.
 The first History Channel scripted series, which been renewed for a fourth season, wraps up on Thursday.
 With the producers safe in that knowledge, we could get a surprising season finale.
 Fox's American remake, Gracepoint, didn't last, but the British mystery series starring David Tennant continues.
 Season 3 has seen a battle for the soul of daughter Paige, the return of fan favorite Margo Martindale and Soviet agent Nina getting back in the game.
 The finale is titled March 8, 1983. That's the date when President Reagan called the Soviet Union an evil empire.
