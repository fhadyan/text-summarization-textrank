 ET Thursday, History.
 The first History Channel scripted series, which been renewed for a fourth season, wraps up on Thursday.
 With the producers safe in that knowledge, we could get a surprising season finale.
 Luke Bryan and Blake Shelton return to host the 50th annual awards.
 The finale is titled March 8, 1983. That's the date when President Reagan called the Soviet Union an evil empire.
