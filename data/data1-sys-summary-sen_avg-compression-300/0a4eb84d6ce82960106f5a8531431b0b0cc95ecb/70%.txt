In real court, however, the rules are different.
  Huth's attorneys should have complied with these rules.
 Cosby breaks his silence.
 Huth filed her complaint long after the time permitted by the statute of limitations.
 Huth claims she and a 16-year-old friend met Cosby at a Los Angeles-area film shoot.
 Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules extending the time to file in cases of childhood sexual abuse.
 First, when asserting claims based on alleged childhood sexual abuse, a plaintiff over the age of 26 has to file Certificates of Merit, documents executed by a licensed mental health practitioner attesting that the allegations have merit.
  Cosby's attorneys correctly point out that Huth failed to file the requisite certificates, which exposes the complaint itself to attack.
  A week later Cosby allegedly plied them with drinks at a tennis club, after which the lawsuit states that Cosby took her to the Playboy Mansion.
 Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit.
  She didn't.
  Her attorneys filed her Complaint naming Cosby.
  Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission.
 Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there.
 Childhood sexual abuse is a detestable crime, and the injuries last a lifetime.
 The court of public opinion will likely ignore these violations as technicalities, and continue to judge, and condemn Cosby.
  But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.
 Cosby and his attorneys are not going quietly into the good night.
  A demurrer essentially says the complaint is so defective as written, that it should be dismissed His attorneys have also gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit.
