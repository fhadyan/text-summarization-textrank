In real court, however, the rules are different.
  Huth's attorneys should have complied with these rules.
 Cosby breaks his silence.
 Huth filed her complaint long after the time permitted by the statute of limitations.
 Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit.
  Her attorneys filed her Complaint naming Cosby.
  Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission.
 Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there.
 Cosby and his attorneys are not going quietly into the good night.
