 Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, known to many people more as an aggrieved movie character or perceived tax dodger than as an actual person, has finally spoken out.
 In an interview with a magazine in his family's native Brazil, Saverin a newly minted billionaire after Facebook's public stock offering talked about his taxes, his relationship with co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and life after The Social Network.
 Saverin has had little to do with Facebook in recent years.
  There was no other way.
 Saverin continues to work as an investor and partner in Internet startups from his Singapore apartment, where an office contains three, 27-inch Mac monitors on which he constantly monitors everything from stock prices to the weather, Altman writes.
 Surprise: The Internet hates rich people.
