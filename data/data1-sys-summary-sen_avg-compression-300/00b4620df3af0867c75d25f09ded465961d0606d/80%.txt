 Federal civil rights investigators have found reasonable cause to believe that police in Portland, Oregon, use unnecessary or unreasonable force with persons who have mental illness, the U.S. Justice Department said.
  The city will lead efforts to boost community mental health treatment options, such as establishing a 24-hour secure drop-off and walk-in center, that will provide police officers more options when assisting persons experiencing a mental health crisis.
 In the 42-page letter, federal officials outline remedies that include training and new policies to investigate alleged police misconduct.
