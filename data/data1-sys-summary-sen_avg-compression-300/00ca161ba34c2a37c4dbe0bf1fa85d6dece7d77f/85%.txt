Twitter has done an impressive job of growing to handle its enormous number of users, while keeping its service simple.
  Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too.

 Now, Facebook probably won't fade away entirely, like early networks such as Friendster.
  But those Facebook addresses are just like AOL keywords 10 years earlier.
