Twitter has done an impressive job of growing to handle its enormous number of users, while keeping its service simple.
  Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too.
 But the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network.
  Communicating in real time about emergency information is clearly one of them.
 Now the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions, media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as Twitter and Facebook.
  In fact, many of us have allowed companies to become intermediaries to all our communications, whether it was AOL 10 years ago or Facebook today.
 Today, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter.
 That sounds absurd, but you can see advertisements today that essentially say Find us on Facebook at facebook.
 com/AcmeWidgets! .
 Now, Facebook probably won't fade away entirely, like early networks such as Friendster.
  But those Facebook addresses are just like AOL keywords 10 years earlier.
