 Tatum had not been seen since March 20..
  That discovery prompted police to issue an Amber Alert for Relisha.
  Our primary focus here was to find Relisha, Lanier said Monday.
  That search is continuing.
 The search for Relisha intensified last week when authorities began combing Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens.
  Tatum purchased, among other items, a carton of black, 42-gallon, self-tie contractor trash bags within the District of Columbia, Lanier said Thursday.
 Lanier said after Relisha was last seen, Tatum continued to go to work and was seen around the capital several times between March 2 and March 20. Lanier said Relisha was not with Tatum in any of those sightings.
