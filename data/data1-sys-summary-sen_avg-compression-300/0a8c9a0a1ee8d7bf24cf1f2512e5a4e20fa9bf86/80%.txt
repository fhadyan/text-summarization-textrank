 The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality this week.
  Over the last several years, however, public opinion has pushed our political conversation forward dramatically.
  Four out of five young voters, of all faiths and political parties, support marriage equality, and even those who continue to oppose marriage rights for same-sex couples can see that it is inevitable.
 The court found DOMA to be unconstitutional and it also allowed marriage rights for same-sex couples to return to California.
 The traditional concept of marriage has evolved over time.
 Marriage is an institution that provides stability for society and for the family.
  Importantly, the court also strengthened the foundation upon which advocates and officials will one day achieve marriage equality nationwide.
