 The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality this week.
  Four out of five young voters, of all faiths and political parties, support marriage equality, and even those who continue to oppose marriage rights for same-sex couples can see that it is inevitable.
 The problem is that even while public opinion has reached an all-time high on marriage equality, old laws discriminating against gay and lesbian Americans have stayed on the books, hurting gay couples and their families.
  Congress passed a law the Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA that forbade the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage, although this is a matter, constitutionally, that most agree belongs to the states to decide.
 The court found DOMA to be unconstitutional and it also allowed marriage rights for same-sex couples to return to California.
 The traditional concept of marriage has evolved over time.
 Marriage is an institution that provides stability for society and for the family.
  Importantly, the court also strengthened the foundation upon which advocates and officials will one day achieve marriage equality nationwide.
  They're gays.
