 Authorities did not say how Hobbs died, but the bureau said investigators believe someone killed her.
  Lester Hobbs and Aja were gone, Goss said.
 The Hobbses were separated, but apparently Tanya Hobbs was visiting Lester Hobbs in an attempt to reconcile, Goss said.
 The Comanche County, Oklahoma, Sheriff's Office said Aja has a medical condition that requires medication.
 The girl Aja Daniell Johnson was reported missing from Geronimo, Oklahoma, late Sunday, the bureau said.
 Goss said Lester Hobbs has an extensive criminal history but did not elaborate.
  The Sheriff's Office said he had prior felony convictions.
 Aja is 4 feet tall and weighs 59 pounds, Goss said.
 Her mother, Tonya Hobbs, 37, was found dead inside a parked RV Sunday night, the bureau said.
  Hobbs and her daughter were visiting Hobbs' estranged husband, Lester William Hobbs, at his sister's home, the bureau said.
  Lester Hobbs is not Aja's biological father, police said.
 Texas authorities also issued an Amber Alert, Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Lisa Block said.
