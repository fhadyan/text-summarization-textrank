 And they evoke violent sectarian rivalries in Iraq and Pakistan, where animosity between Sunni and Shia runs deep.
 LeJ has a long history of targeting the Hazara Shia community in Pakistan.
  The Hazara are numerous in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, and make up much of Afghanistan's Shia minority.
 This year, apparently in retaliation for the killing of Osama bin Laden, LeJ gunned down several Hazara in Quetta, capital of Balochistan province and also home to the Afghan Taliban's political leadership.
 In October, Sunni militants killed dozens more Hazara.
  But other Sunni militants especially factions among the Pakistani Taliban have established a presence in some Afghan border provinces.
 The Taliban were quick to disown and condemn the attacks.
 The Taliban have not played the sectarian card since becoming an insurgency.
  Human Rights Watch documented two massacres of Hazara in 2000 and 2001 by Taliban forces.
 Since the overthrow of the Taliban, Afghanistan's Hazara have prospered in higher education, the government and the military and they have embraced new democratic processes.
 The first claim of responsibility for the bombing in the Afghan capital has come from a militant Sunni group in Pakistan with a history of sectarian attacks against Shia.
 The group is an offshoot of the powerful Lashkar-e-Janghvi (LeJ which has a record of high-profile suicide bombings in Pakistan, including the attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad in 2008. Al-Almi's most destructive attack to date was a double suicide bombing in northwest Pakistan last year.
  The bombers wearing burkas killed 42 people belonging to tribes that opposed the Pakistan Taliban, also known for its antipathy toward Shia.
