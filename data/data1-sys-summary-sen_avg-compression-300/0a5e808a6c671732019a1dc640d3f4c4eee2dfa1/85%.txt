 Nikolay Davydenko produced a ruthless display to beat U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro in straight sets to win the ATP World Tour Finals in London on Sunday.
 But at 4-4 Davydenko made his move on Del Potro's service.
 Del Potro looked weary after his epic three-set semifinal win over Swede Robin Soderling the previous night.
 The second set was tighter, with Del Potro having a break point in the sixth game.
