SEOUL, South Korea The last bit of news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells into the sea near the border with South Korea.
 Disturbing news from North Korea comes just as often as stories that make us laugh in disbelief.
 Pyongyang has created its own version of the world for domestic consumption.
  North Korean government researchers announced their country is the second happiest in the world second only to China.
 Those are two sides of North Korea deliberately frightening and inadvertently comical.
 According to the report, North Korea engages in murder, torture, slavery and mass starvation to terrorize the population into submission.
 North Korea is a Riddle Kingdom that is simultaneously threatening, bizarre and brutal.
