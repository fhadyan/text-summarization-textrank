 But Bristol Palin's request that the case be sealed said public proceedings will turn this custody case into a media circus which is not in Tripp's best interest.
 She said Johnston wanted a public case so he could continue to make a spectacle of this custody dispute for his own self-promotion.
  Johnston was set to take part in a reality show in Alaska, she said.
  I do not believe that it would be in Tripp's best interest for Levi's reality show to be filming this case as it unfolds, or for Levi Johnston to be capitalizing off of this custody case through his reality show, Palin said.
 Johnston's sworn statement said he feared what Sarah Palin might do against him if the case were kept secret.
 Bristol Palin's affidavit said her mother is not involved in the custody case, except as a grandmother.
  He feels Sarah Palin, through her lawyer, under the guise of Bristol Palin's name, would run roughshod over his very bones, Butler said.
 Bristol Palin filed for full custody in November, but Johnston is seeking shared custody.
 But Palin's harshest attack was on Levi's mother, Sherry Johnston, who pleaded guilty to a felony drug charge earlier this year.
 Palin also said that since Sherry Johnston could fall asleep or be too drowsy to appropriately monitor the baby.
  She is also a chronic pain patient and undergoes daily, regular and sustained narcotic infusions, Palin's petition said.
  She must wear an ankle bracelet for electronic monitoring, Corrections Department spokesman Richard Schmitz said.
 Johnston has asked that the case conducted in public to protect himself from Sarah Palin, whom he said was powerful, politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive.
