 So, Gary Oldman, tell us what you really think.
  Mel Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews and he said the wrong thing because he's actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him and doesn't need to feed him anymore because he's got enough dough, Oldman continued.
 Other Oldman tidbits:.
  Asked about Sid & Nancy, his breakthrough film, he said, I don't like myself in the movie.
  It was work, he said.
  You have to edit and cut half of what I've said, because it's going to make me sound like a bigot, he said at one point.
  No, but I'm defending all the wrong people, Oldman said.
  Passionate, certainly, Hochman said.
  It's dishonesty that frustrates me most, Oldman said.
 The Gibson and Baldwin affairs really angered him, he said, because he believes their accusers don't exactly have clean hands themselves.
  I don't know about Mel.
  He got drunk and said a few things, but we've all said those things.
  We're all f ing hypocrites, Oldman said.
