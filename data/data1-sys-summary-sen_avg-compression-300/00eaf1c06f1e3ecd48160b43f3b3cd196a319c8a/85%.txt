Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes.
  Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere, said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar.
 Worldwide use of biochar could cut CO2 levels by 8 parts per million within 50 years, according to NASA scientist James Hansen.
 Thousands of years later, the terra preta soil remains fertile without need for any added fertilizer, experts say.
 Bibens' specialty is biochar, a highly porous charcoal made from organic waste.
