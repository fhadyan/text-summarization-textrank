St Petersburg, Russia Most artistic directors' first day leading a new ballet company is all about meeting the dancers.
 At first Duato was reluctant to change direction towards classical ballet.
 Duato has set himself a challenging schedule, hand-picking three dancers to create a ballet so new it doesn't even have a name yet.
 Duato believes ballet is a living organism, which needs to evolve constantly in order to keep the audience interested.
  It's a philosophy he shares with Kekhman.
  Together we are going to work into something, said Duato.
 A modern ballet dancer and choreographer with an international pedigree, it is hoped he can revitalize the ballet for Russian audiences.
  Russians love ballet.
