Mississippi's Supreme Court last week upheld the controversial pardons of more than 200 convicts that former Gov.
 But during a February Supreme Court hearing, Barbour's lawyers argued that previous state court rulings had found the 30-day notice rule was an unconstitutional encroachment on the governor's power.
 Thursday's ruling is the final word on the case, but Hood said he would seek to get the notice requirement restored to the state charter.
 Barbour has defended his pardons and said the former inmates had been rehabilitated.
 In a 77-page, 6-3 ruling Thursday afternoon, the court found the pardons may not be set aside or voided by the judicial branch.
 Attorney General Jim Hood argued that no proper notice had been posted in newspapers, but the court found the final decision rested solely with the governor.
