 North Korea's latest nuclear test, coming on the heels of December's successful satellite launch, suggests that Pyongyang is moving forward toward developing a nuclear warhead and a deliverable missile system, experts say.
  Declaring sanctions to be tantamount to a declaration of war, North Korea threatened further missile and nuclear tests, which it said are a new phase of confrontation with the United States.
 Tuesday's underground nuclear test is North Korea's third, following tests in 2009 and 2006. The test, probably conducted in the vicinity of P'unggye, yielded several kilotons, according to assessments cited by the U.S. director of national intelligence.
 Estimates of the size, or yield, of the 2009 nuclear test range from 2.5 kilotons to 6 kilotons, Pinkston said.
