Opinion: Has Putin broken international law?.
 After all, in the eyes of many ethnic Russians, it is the Ukrainian nationalists not Putin who are the Nazis.
 In other words, in this situation, who exactly are the Nazis? Putin's ethnic Russian nationalists? Or the fringe of the ethnic Ukrainian nationalists? Neither is particularly pleasant.
  But Putin is still no Hitler, because he lacks the German Fuhrer's global vision.
 Opinion: Putin 2014 vs.
  Putin 2004.
 Nevertheless, calling Putin Hitler is careless.
  Even reckless.
 Of course, what also gets everybody so nervous is leading statesmen comparing Putin to Hitler and, thereby, raising the specter of another world war.
