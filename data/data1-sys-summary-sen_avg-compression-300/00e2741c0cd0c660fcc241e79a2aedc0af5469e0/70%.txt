Britain's Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is going back to work, taking on a new role as an air ambulance pilot.
 The duke will start training in September, a year after leaving the Royal Air Force, where he flew search and rescue helicopters.
  There's also the risk of additional hoax calls.
 These were not a major issues whilst Prince William was a military search and rescue pilot because he was working in a remote part of west Wales and over water.
 Most air ambulance pilots have a military background like the Duke, who joined a squadron based at RAF Valley after qualifying as a search and rescue pilot in 2010. He undertook 156 search and rescue operations, resulting in 149 people being rescued.
 Andrew Egerton Smith, chairman of the East Anglian Air Ambulance said: Having the Duke of Cambridge as one of our pilots is marvelous news as he brings much experience to the charity after his successful career as a search and rescue pilot.
 The palace said the pilot role would be the Duke's primary occupation.
  The East Anglian Air Ambulance is operated by a private company, Bond Air Services, but the Duke will donate his salary to charity.
