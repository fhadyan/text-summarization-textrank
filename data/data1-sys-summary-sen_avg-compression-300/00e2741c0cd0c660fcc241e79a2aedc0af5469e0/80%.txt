Britain's Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is going back to work, taking on a new role as an air ambulance pilot.
 The duke will start training in September, a year after leaving the Royal Air Force, where he flew search and rescue helicopters.
 These were not a major issues whilst Prince William was a military search and rescue pilot because he was working in a remote part of west Wales and over water.
 Most air ambulance pilots have a military background like the Duke, who joined a squadron based at RAF Valley after qualifying as a search and rescue pilot in 2010. He undertook 156 search and rescue operations, resulting in 149 people being rescued.
  He is highly skilled.
 The palace said the pilot role would be the Duke's primary occupation.
