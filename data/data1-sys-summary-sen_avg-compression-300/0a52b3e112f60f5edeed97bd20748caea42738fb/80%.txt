  This was a different Libya than the one I experienced last year a completely new country.
 Brooklyn, New York (VICE.COM) The first time I went to Libya, in 2010, I was arrested just two days into my trip.
 My second trip to Libya consisted of traveling from the Egyptian border to Benghazi and then onto the front lines in Misurata, embedding with a few different rebel groups along the way.
