 More than half a million people a year flock to the Blue Mountains National Park, Australia's most accessible wilderness, to see its impressive peaks and ancient rainforest.
 However, Randal Walker, chairman of Blue Mountains Tourism, argued that it is possible to develop sustainable tourism without damaging the natural beauty that visitors come to see.
 Penelope Figgis, a government advisor on conservation and tourism, also believes the park has to develop.
 She said: Everybody is looking for how we can make national parks relevant into the future.
  The New South Wales government wanted to see how we could connect with nature but also at the same time stimulate regional economies through tourism activities related to nature conservation.
  Only eight percent is national park.
 Its tourism strategy has attracted criticism for refusing to rule out development within the park.
