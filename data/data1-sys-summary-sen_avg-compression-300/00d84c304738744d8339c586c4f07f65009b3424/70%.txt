This past May, disgust for the IRS reached an all-time high when Lois Lerner, director of the IRS's Exempt Organizations unit, disclosed the agency had improperly targeted social welfare organizations seeking special status under section 501(c 4) of the tax code based on their political ideology.
  IRS regulations, however, create a loophole in the law by allowing groups primarily engaged in these types of activities to benefit from this tax status.
  Many 501(c 4) groups have interpreted this regulation to mean they can spend up to 49% of their funds on political activities mostly negative, deceptive political ads.
  Frustrated with the IRS's inaction, in May CREW filed a lawsuit against the IRS for flouting the law barring 501(c 4) organizations from engaging in political activity.
 Because social welfare organizations are not required to disclose their donors, 501(c 4) groups have become the de facto vehicle for millionaires, billionaires, and even corporations who want to remain anonymous while influencing our elections.
  As a result, politically active nonprofit groups spent more than $300 million on the 2012 election.
 With more and more groups seeking to participate in federal elections using money raised from donors who want to remain anonymous, applications to the IRS for 501(c 4) status more than doubled between 2010 and 2012. To manage the deluge, Lerner said the agency relied on code words and other shortcuts to single groups out for extra review.

  Federal law requires these groups to operate exclusively for purposes beneficial to the community as a whole.
