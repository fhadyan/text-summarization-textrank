Native American designers fight cultural caricatures.
  The project is for the people, not just native people but everyone, Wilbur said.
 Questions around Native American identity are central to Project 562. Wilbur asks each person 15 questions about their family history, self-determination, sovereignty and the future.
  Letting them decide is central to the project, Wilbur said.
 Participating in Project 562 was an opportunity for Keene to reflect on what being a contemporary Native American meant to her.
 Wilbur and Keene knew each other before Project 562 through their efforts in a larger movement in Indian country to change negative perceptions of Native Americans.
  Keene, a Harvard-educated post-doctoral researcher at Brown University focusing on Native access to higher education, deconstructs stereotypes of Native Americans on her blog, Native Appropriations.
 Taking Native American fashion 'Beyond Buckskin'.
  Stereotypes in the media reduce Indian country to the Plains Indian in a headdress, said scholar Adrienne Keene, a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma whom Wilbur photographed for the series.
 Creating a legacy for Native youth.
  Some Native Americans lost their language and traditions through assimilation in American Indian boarding schools.
  (Project 562) gives people an opportunity to see the diversity in Indian country and reframe what they think of when they think of Native Americans.
  The life we live is for the people, Wilbur said.
  Having these counter-narratives and counter-representations to the stereotypes and negative portrayals we see in the media every day is really important for helping people understand contemporary Native Americans, said Keene.
 The project is also building relationships in Indian country, cultivating bonds among Wilbur, the participants and also connecting them to elite institutions like the Tacoma Art Museum, Keene said.
