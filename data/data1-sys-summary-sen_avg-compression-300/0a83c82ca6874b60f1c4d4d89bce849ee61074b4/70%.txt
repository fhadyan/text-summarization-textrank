 The Boston Bruins won their first Stanley Cup in 39 years, defeating the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 Wednesday night in the seventh and deciding game of the National Hockey League's annual championship.
 After dropping the first two games in Vancouver, the Bruins took four of the last five games from the Canucks, who struggled to stay in Game Seven after going down 1-0 in the first period.
 Marchand would finish the game with two goals and one assist.
 Some fans stopped to pose in front of the flames.
  Vancouver was also outscored 10-0 in the second period.
 Patrice Bergeron's first period goal should have been enough for fans to know the game's outcome, as the team that scored the first goal won every game in this series.
 The Bruins now have won the Stanley Cup six times, fourth-most among all NHL franchises, but hadn't captured the sport's most coveted prize since 1972. They had been to the finals five other times since they last won, but this time marked their first appearance since 1990..
