 A 4-year-old Ohio girl who vanished more than three weeks ago was found alive and in good condition, halfway across the country in southern California, authorities said.
 Haylee Donathan was found with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, fugitive sex offender Robbie Potter.
 Potter and Watson were still using the same vehicle, a 1980s blue Chevrolet pickup truck they drove from Ohio, Elliott said.
 Haylee Donathan, her mother Candace Watson and Robbie Potter were discovered hiding for the past week at The Morning Star Ranch, a retreat in Valley Center, near San Diego, said Peter Elliott, United States Marshal for the Northern District of Ohio.
 When she is returned to Ohio, Haylee will be placed in the custody of her grandmother, Elliott said.
 Potter was wanted on a state warrant for parole violation and a federal warrant for probation violation.
  Covert said Watson carried a basket of clothing, pillows and blankets.
 Potter is a registered sex offender, officials said.
 Watson will likely face state charges, including harboring a fugitive, according to Elliott.
 Late Tuesday Haylee was in the custody of a children's protective services agency in the San Diego County area, Elliott said.
