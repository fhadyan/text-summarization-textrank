Mexico City A suspected leader of the Juarez drug cartel told authorities he had ordered the deaths of about 1,500 people, a Mexican federal police official said Sunday.
 Acosta told authorities the targets of his criminal organization included police, government officials, rival drug gangs and civilians, Pequeno told reporters.
 Mexican authorities have arrested several others they accuse of being connected to the slayings of three people connected with the consulate last year.
 Pequeno told reporters that Acosta said he ordered the killings of about 1,500 people, mostly in Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua's capital.
 An investigation points to Acosta as the mastermind behind the March 2010 killing of three people connected with the U.S. Consulate in Juarez, Pequeno said.
