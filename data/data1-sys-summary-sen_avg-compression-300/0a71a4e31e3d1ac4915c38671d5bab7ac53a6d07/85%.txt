Pequeno told reporters that Acosta said he ordered the killings of about 1,500 people, mostly in Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua's capital.
 An investigation points to Acosta as the mastermind behind the March 2010 killing of three people connected with the U.S. Consulate in Juarez, Pequeno said.
 Juarez, Mexico's most violent city, shares a border with El Paso, Texas.
