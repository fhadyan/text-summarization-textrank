Madrid Spain is expelling the Libyan ambassador to Madrid and three other Libyan diplomats here, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday.
 The Libyan ambassador to Madrid, Ajeli Abdussalam Ali Breni, has 10 days to leave Spain, the ministry said.
 The government also is expelling three other diplomats at the Libyan embassy who undertook activities incompatible with their diplomatic status, the statement said.
 The Spanish Embassy in Tripoli, staffed only by local Libyan personnel, is not closed in a diplomatic sense, the spokeswoman said.
