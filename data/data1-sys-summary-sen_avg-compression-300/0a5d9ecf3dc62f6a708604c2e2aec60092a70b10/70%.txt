 In recent months, Americans have experienced numerous extreme weather-related events, including droughts, wildfires and heat waves.
  In one recently published study, six international research teams led by scientists from NOAA and a number of countries investigated seven different 2011 extreme weather and climate events.
 Among those events exacerbated by climate change were heat waves in Texas and Oklahoma, the East African drought and extreme temperatures in Europe and England.
  It found that:.
 Such striking trends have strong implications for climate, weather and environmental and human health.
 One upward trend is indisputable: At NOAA, requests for climate data have skyrocketed, and those data are increasingly helping stakeholders cope with extreme events.
  Last year, for example, firefighters in Texas used long-term climate information to prepare for the spring/summer 2011 wildfire season.
 Businesses and governments depend on climate information to make smart investments.
 Electric utilities count on climate data to anticipate peak power requirements and distribute power where it is needed.
  Understandably, many Americans are wondering if these events are manifestations of a longer-term shift in climate.
 At present we cannot definitively link any single extreme event to climate change.
