New Haven, Connecticut A judge in New Haven sentenced a 31-year-old man to death Friday for his role in a deadly home invasion that killed a woman and her two daughters in 2007..
 Jurors convicted Joshua Komisarjevsky in October on six capital felony charges.
 The family of his victims left the courtroom before Komisarjevsky spoke.
 Petit is the sole survivor of the attack that killed his wife and two daughters.
  I lost my family and my home, said Petit.
  My wife, my friend, my partner.
 The two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation, while William Petit managed to escape from the basement, where he had been held.
 Komisarjevsky responded Friday, saying that he came into this trial angry and defiant.
 He said, I did not rape.
