 Lewis Hamilton realistically can't win the title but the former world champion hopes to challenge powerhouse Sebastian Vettel at the Korean Grand Prix after posting the fastest practice times Friday.
 Hamilton's time of one minute, 38.673 seconds in the second session in Yeongam was about one-tenth of a second quicker than Vettel, the triple reigning world champion who has captured the last two races in Korea.
 But Alonso didn't sound optimistic Friday.
 Kimi Raikkonen, Alonso's teammate next season, crashed in the first practice session but was unhurt.

  It's the first time I can remember that second practice has really gone well for me, Mercedes' Hamilton was quoted as saying by Formula One's website.
