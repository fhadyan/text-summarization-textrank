 For Kei Nishikori, Project 45 has transformed into Project 10. .
 The former was the 23-year-old's mission to topple the highest tennis ranking ever held by a Japanese male, Shuzo Matsuoka, who hit world No.
 A first major could be around the corner if famed tennis coach Nick Bollettieri is to be believed.
 Nishikori left Japan for Bollettieri's Florida academy aged just 13 without a grasp of English, but the intensive work on his game bore fruit within five years as he lifted his first ATP Tour title in Delray Beach.
 Both victories served as proof Nishikori has what it takes to prosper at the game's top table.
 He may have lost to eventual champion Rafael Nadal in the fourth round at this year's French Open, but he was the first Japanese player to get to that stage since 1938..
  I love to play against the top ten guys, he said.
  Beating Roger this year and beating Djokovic two years ago that is why I am playing tennis, to play those top 10 guys and to beat them.
 At world No.
  I am trying to get to be the most successful player in Asia, Nishikori added.
 Nishikori smashed through that particular barrier towards the end of 2011 and has enjoyed a formidable few years on Tour, beating the likes of Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.
  Hopefully I can be the first one to lead the young guys.
  The first one is Shuzo Matsuoka, he was the first (successful Japanese player) he was the best tennis player in Japan.
 'Project 45'.
  My first goal after turning pro was to get into the top 100 and after to be 45. It was one of my goals to be number one tennis player in Japan, and now I am ranked No.
  To get to the top 10 is my next goal.
 Like Matsuoka, Nishikori has come to understand what being Japan's sole representative inside the top 120 means fame and adoration.
 This surge towards the game's pinnacle has elevated Nishikori to rock star-like status in his home country, its population clamoring for their first ever grand slam champion.
