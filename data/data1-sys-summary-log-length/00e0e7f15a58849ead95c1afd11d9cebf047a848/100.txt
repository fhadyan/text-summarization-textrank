I'm talking about breaking the habit of faking knowledge in order to save face In other words, a whole generation of kids who've grown up with an emphasis on multiple choice testing, who've been taught that knowing the one right answer is more important than the process of inquiry, who've learned that admitting I don't know is a crime  But we won't ever achieve equity let alone excellence if we don't also work to make our schools places where we all feel safe saying I don't know
