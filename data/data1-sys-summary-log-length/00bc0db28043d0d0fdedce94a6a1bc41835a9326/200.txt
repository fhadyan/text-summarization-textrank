 The inaugural addresses of the presidents are, for the most part, a wasteland of howling rhetoric and dried-out inspiration  Harding  Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it  Barack Obama failed the first time, and since second inaugural addresses are almost always even worse than firsts, it seems almost certain he'll fail again on Monday They fail, first, because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric, even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments  Inaugural addresses can fail even when the ideas are clear, even when the writing is fine, if the addresses make commitments that the ensuing presidency cannot deliver  Garfield  We continue to quote a single sentence from Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural, a sentence from Ronald Reagan's first and a two-word phrase from Lyndon Johnson's  But even if the ideas are clear and the words crisp, an inaugural address can be deemed great only if it is followed by actions that make good on its lofty words
