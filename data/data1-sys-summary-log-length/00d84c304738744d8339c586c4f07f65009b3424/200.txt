This past May, disgust for the IRS reached an all-time high when Lois Lerner, director of the IRS's Exempt Organizations unit, disclosed the agency had improperly targeted social welfare organizations seeking special status under section 501(c 4) of the tax code based on their political ideology  IRS regulations, however, create a loophole in the law by allowing groups primarily engaged in these types of activities to benefit from this tax status With more and more groups seeking to participate in federal elections using money raised from donors who want to remain anonymous, applications to the IRS for 501(c 4) status more than doubled between 2010 and 2012 As the 2014 election cycle gets under way, the super rich and corporations with deep coffers will continue to buy our elections, and Congress will continue to spend time and resources on a never-ending cycle of investigations into a problem with a fairly easy solution: as Congress intended when it first passed the law, prohibit 501(c 4) organizations from spending money on anything other than social welfare activities Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion
