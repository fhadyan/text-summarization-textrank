Yalanda M Moss: One of the interesting things about the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist is that John doesn't lay down his tools and follow Jesus after he baptizes him  There are some hints in the New Testament that Jesus and his followers had to differentiate themselves from John by stating that Jesus' baptism was better (Acts 11:6) and countering the idea that Jesus was actually John raised from the dead (Matthew 14:2) Some scholars argue that these references are evidence of tension between followers of Jesus and followers of John Moss: I'm so glad someone brought up DNA  It's an interesting request that tells us something about John the Baptist's ministry and the demanding characters of Jesus' disciples! In Luke, Jesus responds to this request by teaching them the Lord's Prayer
