Clarksburg, West Virginia North Central West Virginia Airport boasts quick check-ins, free, accessible parking and a convenient baggage claim  But airport director Rick Rock said an economic benefit analysis said the facility contributes about $395 million into the local economy, So I definitely think there's no question that we need this airport  Local students get free flights to Washington for school trips as well, Rock said But Coburn said at least five airports have used creative ways to keep the money flowing in and has managed to get support for a congressional investigation to find out how airports like North Central West Virginia can get so much money for so few passengers Thanks to a Federal Aviation Administration program that gives small regional airports millions of dollars if they can reach a certain level of passenger traffic, the Clarksburg, West Virginia, facility tries its best to get 10,000 passengers off the ground by the end of the year  They were trying to meet the quota, and they were 300 passengers short, said Pierson, who saw an ad placed by the airport advertising the free flights
