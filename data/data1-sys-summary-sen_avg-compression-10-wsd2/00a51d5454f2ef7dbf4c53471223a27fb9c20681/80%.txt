Marco Rubio is all in.meanwhile, both the Deferred action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favor by Hispanic.But when it come to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seem firmly stick in the past.immigration and Cuba policy away, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanic.Rubio favor little government, while Latino are more likely than the general public to say they favor a big government that provide more service over a little government that provide less.And though Rubio question that climate change is have by man, The New York time has note that Latino view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue.sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.another Rubio weakness is how-do-you-do want of bold policy proposal.By comparison, Rubio seem cautious and ill-suited to the project of charge republican voter.rather, Rubio has embrace a typical conservative approach to immigration.
