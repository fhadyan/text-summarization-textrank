I know it.Mizrahi: It change every day, and I really like that.Always.I don't really know travel.CNN: say you're walk down the street.Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair.I would say that's the most common style fault I see is bad hair.You know people have excuse for bad shoe because you know some people have back problem, it is the street and they're walk and walk and walk but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair.Because you know what? There's a hat, if your hair is really that bad that day.I like to think about cabinet.I think that nothing is way well than bad prime.I use to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, and I don't know, I dress in a very particular way now and it's about like clockwork.Mizrahi: I don't know.
