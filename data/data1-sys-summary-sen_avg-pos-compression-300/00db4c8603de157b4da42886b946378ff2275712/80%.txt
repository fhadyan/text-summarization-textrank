 In September 1985 a devastating earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter Scale smashed into Mexico City killing 10,000 people and leaving parts of the city in ruins.
  He moved to Mexico City after working in Haiti and witnessing the devastation caused by the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck the Caribbean island in 2010 killing more than 230,000 people.
 It's called the Grillo (the Spanish word for cricket) early warning system.
 When seismic activity is detected, the Grillo sounds a loud, flashing alarm.
 The SASMEX facility came online in 1991 and reacts to data gathered by sensors placed near major fault lines along Mexico's Pacific coast.
 Meira also hopes versions of the Grillo system could be introduced elsewhere in the world where earthquakes are a real risk like in Nepal, India, the West Coast of the U.S. and along much of the Pacific Coast of South America.
 Receivers dotted around five major cities, including Mexico City and Acapulco, will sound the alarm if they detect an earthquake.
 Meira and his colleagues have anticipated such difficulties.
 Warning app.
  And that system, which consists of 1,000 GPS sensors.
 Now, they await the next earthquake.
