Kimi Raikkonen, Alonso's teammate next season, crashed in the first practice session but was unhurt.
 Vettel admitted there was some room for improvement in his Red Bull.
  It will be close with Mercedes, he told Formula One's website.
 The only driver with half-a-chance of catching Vettel, Fernando Alonso, was a distant seventh in the second session.
