 Affectionately known in his home city of Madrid as the wise man of Hortaleza, Luis Aragones left the legacy of helping Spain's ascension to the top of world football.
  We much appreciate his respect for Barca, its model and our players.
 Aragones' appreciation of Barca's tiki taka style started by Johann Cruyff and developed by Pep Guardiola was borne out by the number of the players from the Catalan club he selected for the national team.
  The loss of Luis Aragones saddens all of us who love football, said Real president Florentino Perez.
  I felt a great deal of appreciation towards him, Del Bosque told the national team's official website.
  Luis Aragones was a great player and coach, but before all that a great person and a friend, said the team's president Enrique Cerezo.
