Haylee Donathan was found with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, fugitive sex offender Robbie Potter.
 Authorities had feared Haylee was endangered.
 When she is returned to Ohio, Haylee will be placed in the custody of her grandmother, Elliott said.
  Haylee was not on that video.
  Covert said Watson carried a basket of clothing, pillows and blankets.
 Potter is a registered sex offender, officials said.
