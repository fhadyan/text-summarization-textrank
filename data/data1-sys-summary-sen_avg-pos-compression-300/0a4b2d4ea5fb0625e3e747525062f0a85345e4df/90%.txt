 I don't think we have time to think of Carnival, Lassegue said.
 Carnival's three days of deliverance and celebration has tremendous importance in the lives of Haitians, Lassegue said.
  Almost every band in Haiti debuts new pieces at Carnival.
  Music, Martino said, was so essential to Haitian life.
  We're all so traumatized, he said.
  Carnival, he said, was Haiti's musical showcase.
  This is the first time Carnival is not happening, said Roberto Martino, lead singer of popular Kompa band T-Vice.
