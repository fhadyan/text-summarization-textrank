Twitter is on the verge of its initial public offering and everyone's knickers have been in a knot all week over the company's lack of management diversity that is, women.
  Fully one-tenth had no women serving on their boards at all.
  In the past five years, women and minorities have lost ground despite evidence strongly suggesting that gender parity and board diversity have positive effects on profitability.
 However, companies regularly draw executives from outside their own industries sometimes, yes, even women when seeking senior-level and board positions.
  Companies redefine pipeline every day particularly when profits are involved.
  The investors? All men.
  These facts don't reflect women lacking in confidence ideas.
  Year after year, studies such as one last week from the Directors Guild of America, as well as reports from Who Makes the News and the Women's Media Center Status on Women in Media document exactly how distorted mainstream media ownership, management and production remain.
 First, there aren't enough women at Twitter or in the tech world because there aren't enough women anywhere.
  In 2012 women held 16.6% of Fortune 500 board seats.
  Women of color were 3.3% of the total.
