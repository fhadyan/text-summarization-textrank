Lisbon, Portugal Calling it a significant step forward for the alliance and European security, President Obama announced Friday that NATO will develop a missile defense system to safeguard most of Europe and the United States.
 The agreement, according to the president, followed a year of talks to determine the best ways to coordinate efforts to protect members of the 61-year-old alliance.
  The defense alliance will also develop a standing capability to train local security forces and create a civilian arm to deal with other nations and groups.
 Obama said that starting then, NATO will work with Russia to build our cooperation with them in this area recognizing that we share many of the same threats.
  A failure to ratify [this treaty] will put at risk the substantial progress that has been made in advancing our nuclear security and our partnership with Russia, Obama said.
 The search for a new mandate for the entire alliance comes at a time that 16 of the 28 NATO members have announced cuts in defense spending.
  NATO officials said leaders are expected to agree at the summit on a list of the top 10 spending priorities, including helicopters, transfer aircraft, technology to combat improvised explosive devices and increased medical capabilities.
 The missile defense plan offers a role for all of our allies in response to the threats of our times, the president said.
  In an alliance that finds achieving consensus is central, having one partner clearly overshadow all others highlights the real limits of the transatlantic alliance, the report said.
