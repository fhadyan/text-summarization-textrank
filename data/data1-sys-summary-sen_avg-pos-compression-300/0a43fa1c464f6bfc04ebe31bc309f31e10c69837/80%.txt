'The project is for the people'.
 Wilbur, whose first name means the messenger, said the images allow Americans to see a diverse representation of a group they rarely see and hear from.
  The project is for the people, not just native people but everyone, Wilbur said.
  Letting them decide is central to the project, Wilbur said.
 Wilbur and Keene knew each other before Project 562 through their efforts in a larger movement in Indian country to change negative perceptions of Native Americans.
  Stereotypes in the media reduce Indian country to the Plains Indian in a headdress, said scholar Adrienne Keene, a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma whom Wilbur photographed for the series.
  Keene told Wilbur about how her Cherokee ancestors were forced from their ancestral lands in western North Carolina to Oklahoma.
 The concept of identity is fluid from person to person and generation to generation, Wilbur said.
  The life we live is for the people, Wilbur said.
 The project is also building relationships in Indian country, cultivating bonds among Wilbur, the participants and also connecting them to elite institutions like the Tacoma Art Museum, Keene said.
