SEOUL, South Korea The last bit of news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells into the sea near the border with South Korea.
 Disturbing news from North Korea comes just as often as stories that make us laugh in disbelief.
 With its conventional and nuclear arsenals, North Korea manages to keep the international community, including the United States, scrambling for an approach that might neutralize the danger and send a lifeline to the victims of the cruel regime.
  But Pyongyang has launched deadly attacks.
 The authorities have created their own reality, brainwashed the population to keep the state functioning and the regime secure.
  By firing missiles, threatening neighbors and acting erratically, North Korea portrays itself as mysterious and volatile, and even that perception magnifies its ability to create fear, adding to its power and helping keep the despotic regime in control.
 North Korea is a Riddle Kingdom that is simultaneously threatening, bizarre and brutal.
