As families prepare for air travel this coming Memorial Day weekend, United Airlines won't be offering early boarding to families in coach with small children.
  We transitioned to a common boarding process across all aircraft, Hobart said.
 JetBlue offers families traveling coach with children under age 2 to board early, the airline said.
  Delta Air Lines said it also offers passengers with children an opportunity to preboard, including those with first class and business class tickets.
  So does Virgin America, which said it allows children under 5 to board early.
  Previously the airline had allowed earlier boarding.
  The airline does allow passengers with children traveling in first class or business class to board early.
