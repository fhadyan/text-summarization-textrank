London, England Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup.
 Delaney said the FAI had also written to the French football federation.
 However, it said that under its regulations the referee's decision cannot be changed.
 Ireland team manager Giovanni Trapattoni told reporters that the referee had time to ask the linesman and then Henry.
 The Irish Justice Ministry confirmed to CNN that Dermot Ahern had asked the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to demand a replay in the interests of fair play.
