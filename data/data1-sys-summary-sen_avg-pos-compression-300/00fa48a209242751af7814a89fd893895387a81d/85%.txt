London, England Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup.
 Television cameras showed Henry guiding the ball with his hand twice, before William Gallas scored from his resulting cross to give Les Bleus a narrow win in the two-legged World Cup play-off against the Republic of Ireland.
  The governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay.
 Delaney said the FAI had also written to the French football federation.
 However, it said that under its regulations the referee's decision cannot be changed.
 Ireland team manager Giovanni Trapattoni told reporters that the referee had time to ask the linesman and then Henry.
 The Irish Justice Ministry confirmed to CNN that Dermot Ahern had asked the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to demand a replay in the interests of fair play.
