Beijing Families of Chinese passengers on board missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have engaged in a rare late-night act of civil disobedience in this tightly-controlled city.
 Around midnight, more than one hundred relatives staged a pre-dawn sit-in outside the embassy gates.
 Broken promises.
  Their destination: the Malaysian Embassy.
  Families have organized committees, issued press releases, and printed t-shirts and hats with the slogan Pray for MH370. But they have also been largely prevented from organizing public displays outside the windowless hotel conference room that serves as the families' improvised headquarters.
  They're lying.
