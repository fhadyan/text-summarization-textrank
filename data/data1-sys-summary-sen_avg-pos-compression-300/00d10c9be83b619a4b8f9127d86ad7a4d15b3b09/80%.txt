Super Bowl XLVIII started out bad for the Denver Broncos.
 Denver, led by the 37-year-old Manning, has the NFL's best offense, statistically, but never got moving Sunday.
 Seattle romped 43-8 by playing a suffocating defense and taking advantage of four Denver turnovers, including two interceptions thrown by quarterback Peyton Manning, the NFL's most valuable player for the season.
 The secrets of the Super Bowl flyover.
 Seattle's defense was so strong that Denver managed only 27 yards rushing, compared with 135 for Seattle.
 Fittingly, a Seattle defensive player, linebacker Malcolm Smith, was named the game's most valuable player.
