Here on this Caribbean island, and on the others that make up what's known as the West Indies, life revolves around one thing cricket.
 Murray agreed.
 Overflowing with talent, the islands of the West Indies could have fielded at least two teams of world-class players.
 'Rebel tours'.
 To save cricket in South Africa, the sport's administrators knew something had to be done.
 And it wasn't long before many began suspecting South Africa was also targeting a team from the West Indies, the dominant force in world cricket.
 Many big-name West Indies stars were outspoken in their refusal to play in apartheid South Africa.
  I made the decision because I wasn't getting treated right as far as the West Indies (team) was concerned, said King.
  And I said to myself, 'Well, cricket is my job.
  You're not picking me, I'll go play cricket someplace where people will see proper cricket And that's why I went.
 More than just cricket.
  I knew the tour was more important than being just cricket, Stephenson said.
  We packed them in, said Murray.
  It seemed South African fans couldn't get enough of the black cricketers from the West Indies.
  For the first time, they were seeing blacks beating whites, said newspaper writer Al Gilkes, the only journalist from the Caribbean to go to South Africa.
 'Destroyed as cricketers'.
 Even within the country itself, non-whites protested the West Indies rebels.
 The fate of their cricketing careers rested with the West Indies Cricket Board of Control.
  Many of them were destroyed as cricketers, said University of West Indies Professor Hilary Beckles.
  Their cricket careers came to an end.
 In 1983, the West Indies cricket team was on top of the world.
  Nobody looked out for us, Stephenson said.
 And to this day, they hold strongly to the belief that being in South Africa in 1983 made a difference in disbanding apartheid, less than a decade after the West Indies players were there.
