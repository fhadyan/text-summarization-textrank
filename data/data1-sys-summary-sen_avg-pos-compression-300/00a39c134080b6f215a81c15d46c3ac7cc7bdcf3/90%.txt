 Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that.

 Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair.
 You know people have excuses for bad shoes because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they're walking and walking and walking but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair.
