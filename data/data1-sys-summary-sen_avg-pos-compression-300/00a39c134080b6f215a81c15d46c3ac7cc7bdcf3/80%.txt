Isaac Mizrahi has earned four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.
 Isaac Mizrahi: Well, you know what, I think it's all theater.
 Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that.
  I wake up, I go swimming every day, and I eat the same breakfast almost every single day.
 I don't really love travel.
 CNN: Say you're walking down the street.
 Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair.
 You know people have excuses for bad shoes because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they're walking and walking and walking but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair.
  Because you know what? There's a hat, if your hair is really that bad that day.
  [Laughter .
 Mizrahi: You know what it is with people? I think people get lazy when it comes to being at home they leave things around.
  You know what I mean?.
 Mizrahi: It's gotten a lot quieter, my personal style.
  I used to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, and I don't know, I dress in a very particular way now and it's almost like clockwork.
 Mizrahi: I don't know.
