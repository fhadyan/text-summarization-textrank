 The incident happened because of security breach.
 All three blasts were the work of suicide bombers, said Nayab Haider, a spokesman for the Lahore police.
  Police have found two heads and one body separately, said Haider, who said authorities had assigned 2,500 police officers to the procession after receiving a warning that it might be attacked.
