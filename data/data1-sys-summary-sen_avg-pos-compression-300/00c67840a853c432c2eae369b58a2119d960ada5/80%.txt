The 14-year-old racehorse, one of the greatest steeplechasers of all time and a two-time Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, made his dressage debut at London's Olympia Horse Show on Tuesday.
 Laura Collett, a leading British event rider, has been helping the horse to learn the intricacies of a sport that rewards precision and poise above power and pace.
  He's changed shape a lot since we got him, Collett told Horse and Hound magazine in the build-up to Kauto Star's demonstration dressage test at Olympia.
  But he's got a brilliant temperament and he's very willing.
