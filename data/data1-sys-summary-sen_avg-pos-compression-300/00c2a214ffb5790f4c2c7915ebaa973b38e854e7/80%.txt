LONDON, England Britain's Prince Harry turned 25 Tuesday in the knowledge that he is now entitled to part of the multi-million dollar inheritance left to him by his late mother.
 Prince Harry is currently training to become a helicopter pilot with the British Army.
 In February this year, he was formally disciplined by his Army superiors after videos surfaced showing him using offensive language referring to a fellow soldier as a Paki and another as looking like a raghead.
  What's done is done.
