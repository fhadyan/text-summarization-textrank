An Oklahoma woman said she has already faced the kind of ire Anthony may face when she's no longer behind the protective walls of the Orange County Jail.
 Sheriff Jerry Demings said Tuesday that investigators are assessing threats to Anthony's safety.
  Casey Anthony had her day in court and the jury made a decision.
 What Anthony will do after her release is unclear.
 Attorney J. Cheney Mason, who once said he thought of Anthony as a granddaughter, said he doesn't know what life holds in store for his client, but has hopes.
  She is only 25 year old.
