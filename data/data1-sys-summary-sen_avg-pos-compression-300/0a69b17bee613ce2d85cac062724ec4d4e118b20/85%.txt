 Painted on the rock face behind the tiny waterfall are a pair of faded eland, the largest antelope in Africa.
  The artists used the blood and fat of the eland as well as whitened clay, bird droppings and charcoal as pigments.
  This is a sacred place, says Raphael Mnkhati, a guide from the Kamberg Rock Art Center.
 The tiny cave behind the waterfall is only one of thousands of such hidden, secret shelters in the Drakensberg-Ukahlamba Mountains of South Africa.
