 Thailand's rice bowl is now Thailand's nightmare.
 The Chao Phraya River delta nourishes the nation's vast rice paddies.
 Everyone helped each other.
  But Friday, the river and its many tributaries eyed the capital, Bangkok, like a ferocious animal stalking its prey.
  Evacuation centers began to fill with people.
 Some recalled the devastating 2004 tsunami that wiped out everything with walls of water.
 Monsoonal rains have flooded Thailand's plains and now the bursting river threatens to drown Bangkok.
 The water was not raging.
  In two hours, they said, everything would be under water.
 The water has already turned parking lots into marinas, markets into lakes and houses into homes suitable only for fish.
 The government's Flood Relief Centre chief said that Bangkok would be spared.
