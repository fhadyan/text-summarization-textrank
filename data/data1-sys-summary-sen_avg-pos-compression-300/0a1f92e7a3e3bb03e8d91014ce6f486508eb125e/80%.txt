 We're trying to get this child buried with dignity and respect, said Tony Herbert, a spokesman for Dobson.
 The boy had burn marks and abrasions on his head, neck, face and testicles, court papers said.
  The child appeared malnourished, the complaint said.
 King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch on December 17 and that she was the child's primary and sole caretaker until the time of his death, the complaint said.
 At a news conference Friday, Herbert said that Dobson lost custody of her son for financial reasons.
  Herbert and Dobson demanded answers from child welfare authorities.
  The city of New York put the child in the care of the father, who they knew was a felon, Herbert said.
 David Bookstaver, a family court spokesman, said Wednesday that the mother's financial straits or stay at a shelter had nothing to do with her losing custody of the child.
 Dobson told police that Myls later fell down stairs and struck his head.
  Philip Lights, Dobson's lawyer, said the case was later dismissed after his client agreed to counseling and treatment under the supervision of child welfare authorities.
 In tears, she said, I love my son.
  He always gave me kisses.
 After arriving at King's home on December 17, the complaint said, Myls Dobson lost 20 to 25 pounds.
