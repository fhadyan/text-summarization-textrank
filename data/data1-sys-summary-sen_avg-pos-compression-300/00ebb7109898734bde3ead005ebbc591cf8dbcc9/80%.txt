Rigatuso said she hopes people would not turn their backs on Rogers now.
  Rigatuso said Tuesday.
 But the Lincoln Police Department said Tuesday that the physical evidence conflicted with Charlie Rogers' version of events and that extensive investigation revealed numerous inconsistencies.
 McArthur, Rogers' attorney, said he knows nothing about the fund or how much money might be in it.
  He said it was in place before he became Rogers' lawyer.
 Russell also described a pair of white gloves found at the scene that Rogers had said were not hers.
  Rogers DNA profile was the major contributor to the DNA located on the inside of the gloves, Russell said.
 Furthermore, the deposition said, the FBI sent photos of Rogers' cuts to a forensic pathologist, who believed the wounds to be self-inflicted.
 Mikolajczyk said Tuesday that she is no longer Rogers' attorney.
  I was in shock, Rappl said soon after the incident.
 Rogers was arrested Tuesday, police said.
 Rappl said she took the sobbing Rogers inside and wrapped her in a blanket before calling 911..
