 It would simply be about protecting people from something that is everywhere in America: gun violence yes, at airports, and also at schools, at movie theaters, and malls.
 If you're the kind of person who thinks that every teacher and hall monitor and mall cop and cinema usher should be armed, then you'll probably feel safer if we give guns to TSA officers.
  And maybe flight attendants and customer service reps and baggage handlers.
 LAX shooting delays flights nationwide.
  Of course, I was wrong, and thankfully employees' bags are now screened, but giving guns to airline and airport workers is still a disquieting idea.
 So, reports of today's airport shooting raise new fears about weaknesses in this system.
 And is it time to start arming Transportation Security Administration officials?.
 No way.
