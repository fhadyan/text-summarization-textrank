 Scott said the chemicals were so potent that staff caring for the boy at the hospital became ill as well, he said.
 Olsen said police would decide how to charge Barahona further once the autopsy on his daughter determines her cause of death.

 The boy was hospitalized in intensive care with severe burns to his abdomen, upper thighs and buttocks, the affidavit said.
