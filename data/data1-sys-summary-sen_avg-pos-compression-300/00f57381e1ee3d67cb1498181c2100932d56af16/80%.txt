 The forward operating bases are owned and maintained by the Hondurans, and they have operated them for years, Diaz said.
 What's not new is the teamwork between the DEA and vetted Honduran police who participate in the operations, Posivak said.
 Operation Anvil seeks to track planes entering Honduras, ascertains where they will land, and then sends helicopters out to make arrests, Posivak said.

  It's not a problem that can be solved by law enforcement alone, he said.
 The goal is to address security concerns through all means, he said.

 They wrote the letter, he said, because Hondurans are fearful of the prospect of militarization without end.

 Posivak, the U.S. embassy spokesman, said Operation Anvil has already proven successful at disrupting criminal organizations.
  We believe these interdictions have had a strong impact, he said.
  The amount of drugs seized and the disruption of narcotrafficking routes speak for themselves, said Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro, the Honduran ambassador to the United States.
