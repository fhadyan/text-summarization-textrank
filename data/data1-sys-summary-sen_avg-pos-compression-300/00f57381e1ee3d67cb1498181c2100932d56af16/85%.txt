 There is no clear oversight from Congress over what is going on, she said.
 Operation Anvil seeks to track planes entering Honduras, ascertains where they will land, and then sends helicopters out to make arrests, Posivak said.
 The DEA is in Honduras at the request of our government in a support and training capacity, Hernandez said.
  It's not a problem that can be solved by law enforcement alone, he said.
 The goal is to address security concerns through all means, he said.
 As of Wednesday, authorities said, they had interdicted five planes, seized about 2,300 kilos of cocaine, and made seven arrests.
  For us who gain no benefit, these costs are unacceptable, Pastor said.
 Hernandez, the Honduran ambassador, counters that Operation Anvil and other programs are not military operations, but law enforcement ones.
 Drug cartels exert such influence in the region that both law enforcement and civilian government agencies have been corrupted, he said.
  These factors are not favorable for long-term success, he said.
 Posivak, the U.S. embassy spokesman, said Operation Anvil has already proven successful at disrupting criminal organizations.
  We believe these interdictions have had a strong impact, he said.
  The amount of drugs seized and the disruption of narcotrafficking routes speak for themselves, said Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro, the Honduran ambassador to the United States.
