 In excerpts from a 341-page book to be released Monday, Scott McClellan writes on the war in Iraq that Bush and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war.
  I think the difference with McClellan's book is he's now telling us something we all know that the war with Iraq was a disastrous war [and] was sold with deception.
 McClellan wrote he didn't realize what he said was untrue until reporters began digging up details of the case almost two years later.
 White House spokeswoman Dana Perino called McClellan's description of his time at the White House sad.
