Taiwan announced Monday it was banning the importation of all dairy products from China because of melamine contamination in milk supplies on the mainland, Taiwan's Health Ministry said Monday.
 Investigators arrested two brothers who sold milk used to produce the contaminated baby milk powder last week.
 Thousands of tons of the tainted milk powder have been recalled.
 The chemical melamine blamed for causing kidney stones and kidney failure has been detected in formula milk powder from 22 dairies across China.
