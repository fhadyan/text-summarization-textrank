Although it's understandable for employees to be upset, frustrated and discouraged when benefits or perks are taken away, Kevin Sheridan, founder and CEO of HR Solutions, which specializes in helping organizations to keep employees engaged, said that employees are less likely to be upset if management communicates with employees.
  Budgets have been cut, layoffs made and furloughs instituted, and benefits and perks have evaporated.
  If leadership had simply asked employees which benefits were important to them, this situation may be avoided.
  Twenty-three percent said they thought about leaving because of pay; 18 percent because of a supervisor or manager; 15 percent because of career advancement; and 5 percent because of benefits.
  This statistic is especially important because many organizations have cut benefits over the last six months, and it illustrates that the majority of employees have not thought of resigning as a result of adjusted benefits, Sheridan said.
  These employees recognize the advantages of sticking around with a company, benefits or not, for advantages such as career development and compensation.
 Sixty-five percent of those employers indicated that they would cut back company social events, 61 percent anticipated curtailing business travel, 25 percent expected to scale back on health-care benefits and 11 percent planned to reduce wellness benefits.
 Nancy Irwin, a motivational speaker and author, said employees can take turns bringing in coffee, bagels or potluck lunches to help fill the void of things that have been cut.
 Such perks and benefits being taken away make for a tough situation for employees.
