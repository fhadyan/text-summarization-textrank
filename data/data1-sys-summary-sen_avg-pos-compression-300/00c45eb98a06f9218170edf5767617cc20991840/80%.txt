 Ferguson is crumbling.
  The cowardly and reprehensible shooting Wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the Missouri town, which had already seen Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announce his resignation after a damning Justice Department report on its police department.
  America is changing fast, but police departments aren't keeping up.
 Having military equipment on our streets does not make citizens feel safer, which is why the Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act was recently reintroduced in Congress.
  Yet until such a bill is passed, war weapons will continue to flood our streets; Congress must act to stem this tide.
  In fact, the opposite happens.
 Residents understandably want justice.
  If we don't press our police departments to reflect the makeup and needs of our communities, then towns like Ferguson will unravel further.
