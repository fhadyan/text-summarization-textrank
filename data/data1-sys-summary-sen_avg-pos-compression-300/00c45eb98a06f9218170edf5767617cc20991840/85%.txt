 Ferguson is crumbling.
  The cowardly and reprehensible shooting Wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the Missouri town, which had already seen Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announce his resignation after a damning Justice Department report on its police department.
  America is changing fast, but police departments aren't keeping up.
  Yet until such a bill is passed, war weapons will continue to flood our streets; Congress must act to stem this tide.
  If we don't press our police departments to reflect the makeup and needs of our communities, then towns like Ferguson will unravel further.
