Iran has repeatedly insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian energy purposes only.
 According to the IAEA report, Iran is believed to have continued weapons research and technology development after 2003, when the intelligence community thought Iran had stopped.
 Rogers, R-Michigan, said new sanctions should cut off the supply of refined fuel to Iran and target its central bank, which he said is being used to finance Tehran's nuclear program.
  The agency has serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program, the report said.
  Israel considers Iran its arch-nemesis for its repeated innuendos about the destruction of the Jewish state.
 U.S. officials said the Obama administration will use the report to lobby the international community to slap new economic sanctions against Iran.
 CNN's Elise Labott, Jill Dougherty and Moni Basu contributed to this report.
  The report is very comprehensive, credible, quite damning, and alarming, the official said.
