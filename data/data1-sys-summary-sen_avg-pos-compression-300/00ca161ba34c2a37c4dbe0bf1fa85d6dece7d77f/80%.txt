Twitter has done an impressive job of growing to handle its enormous number of users, while keeping its service simple.
  Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too.
  Smart inventors have already made cutting-edge technologies that let any site deliver messages with the same immediacy as Twitter or Facebook.
 Now the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions, media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as Twitter and Facebook.
 Today, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter.
 That sounds absurd, but you can see advertisements today that essentially say Find us on Facebook at facebook.

  And it is conceivable that the organizations and companies who communicate on Facebook today may want to become more independent.
 There's no reason that organizations or individuals who want to use the Web to relay critical information have to rely on Twitter or Facebook or Google or any other giant of the technology industry in the first place.
