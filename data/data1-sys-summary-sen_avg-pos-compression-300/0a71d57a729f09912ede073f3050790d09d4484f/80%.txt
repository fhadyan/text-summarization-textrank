 Almost 30 years later, Etan Patz is still missing.
  Etan's case was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s.
  They noticed that they looked a lot like Etan Patz, according to author Lisa R Cohen's book about the case, After Etan: The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive.
 Bronx police questioned Ramos, and he denied having anything to do with Etan's disappearance.
  He left town and disappeared for six years until GraBois reviewed Etan's case.
  GraBois said he focused on Ramos as the prime suspect.
 GraBois said he learned in 1988 that Ramos had been arrested and convicted of child molestation and was serving time in a Pennsylvania prison.
  Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights, GraBois said.
 Ramos is serving a 10- to 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania.
 GraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison, and planted informants as his cell mates.
 Etan's case is still considered by the NYPD to be a cold case.
