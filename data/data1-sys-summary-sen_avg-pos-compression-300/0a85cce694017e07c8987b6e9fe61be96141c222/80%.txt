 Petraeus will remain in command in Afghanistan until Allen is ready to take over at the beginning of September, officials said, which could require an interim CIA director if Panetta moves to the defense secretary's office as planned on July 1..
 In addition, Petraeus will resign from the military once confirmed so that he serves as a civilian CIA director, officials said.
