The Pérez Art Museum had a smooth opening last year except for one slight hiccup: naming it.
  It seems they had their heart set on the Miami Art Museum.
  Some of the board members argued the name of the museum should represent the city's central art museum.
 But, she points out, naming Miami's art museum after Pérez carries a sense of pride for the Hispanic community, even though his art donation doesn't represent a collection.
 Jorge Pérez hopes his museum will help take Miami to the next level.
