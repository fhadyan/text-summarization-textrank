The real estate developer and art lover donated $40 million, half made up from his private art collection, to the Pérez Art Museum Miami, known as PAMM, one of the few major institutions in the United States with a Hispanic name.
 The Pérez Art Museum had a smooth opening last year except for one slight hiccup: naming it.
  It seems they had their heart set on the Miami Art Museum.
  Some of the board members argued the name of the museum should represent the city's central art museum.
  Patricia and Phillip Frost are very well-liked people and they symbolize what we're about, said Gillian Thomas, president and CEO of Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science.
 But, she points out, naming Miami's art museum after Pérez carries a sense of pride for the Hispanic community, even though his art donation doesn't represent a collection.
  Jorge Pérez is the first major donor from the Hispanic community, Thomas said.
 Ancient village found in Miami.
 Jorge Pérez hopes his museum will help take Miami to the next level.
