 More than half a million people a year flock to the Blue Mountains National Park, Australia's most accessible wilderness, to see its impressive peaks and ancient rainforest.
  It's not in Sydney's interests to see this area develop the attraction for Sydney people to come here is our lack of development.
 However, Randal Walker, chairman of Blue Mountains Tourism, argued that it is possible to develop sustainable tourism without damaging the natural beauty that visitors come to see.
 Penelope Figgis, a government advisor on conservation and tourism, also believes the park has to develop.
 She said: Everybody is looking for how we can make national parks relevant into the future.
  Only eight percent is national park.

 Its tourism strategy has attracted criticism for refusing to rule out development within the park.
