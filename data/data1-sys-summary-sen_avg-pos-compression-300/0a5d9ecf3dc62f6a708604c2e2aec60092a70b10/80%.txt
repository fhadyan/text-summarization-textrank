 In recent months, Americans have experienced numerous extreme weather-related events, including droughts, wildfires and heat waves.
 Among those events exacerbated by climate change were heat waves in Texas and Oklahoma, the East African drought and extreme temperatures in Europe and England.
 One upward trend is indisputable: At NOAA, requests for climate data have skyrocketed, and those data are increasingly helping stakeholders cope with extreme events.
  Last year, for example, firefighters in Texas used long-term climate information to prepare for the spring/summer 2011 wildfire season.
 Coastal managers are using sea-level-rise data to protect crucial infrastructure.
 Businesses and governments depend on climate information to make smart investments.
 Electric utilities count on climate data to anticipate peak power requirements and distribute power where it is needed.
