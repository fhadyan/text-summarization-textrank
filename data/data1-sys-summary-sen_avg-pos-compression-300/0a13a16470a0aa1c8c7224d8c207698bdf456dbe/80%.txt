 Polygamist sect leader Warren Steed Jeffs, who is awaiting trial in southern Utah, was charged with eight additional felony counts from Arizona in two separate cases, authorities said Thursday.
 Polygamist Warren Jeffs is facing eight additional counts related to alleged incest and sexual contact with a minor.
 Jeffs, 51, is awaiting trial in Washington County, Utah, on a charge of being an accomplice to rape by arranging the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin.
 Those charges, from 2005, were put on hold while Jeffs faces trial in Utah.
 Jeffs was captured August 28, 2006, in a traffic stop near Las Vegas, Nevada.
  The cases involve two separate victims, Smith said in the statement.
