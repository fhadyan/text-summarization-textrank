 The 17 Uyghurs had left China and made their way to Afghanistan, where they settled in a camp with other Uyghurs opposed to the Chinese government, the Justice Department said in its statement.
 The official said the average in such cases is $100,000 per person.
  China has said no returned Uyghurs would be tortured.
 Palau said it will take in the ethnic Uyghur detainees for humanitarian reasons and because of the special relationship between Palau and the United States.
