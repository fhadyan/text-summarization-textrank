Editor's note:.
 (Global Mail) The night Bob Hawke lost the Labor leadership 20-odd years ago, I was a tender recruit to the Canberra press gallery who found myself, fortuitously, marooned at the Prime Minister's office door whilst the Labor caucus was dispatching the occupant.
 Australian FM Kevin Rudd resigns.
 Hawke, the Labor Party and most Australians knew that Keating had Hawke lined up for the kill.
 Not so Kevin Rudd.
 Gillard calls for Australian Labor Party leadership vote.
 But Rudd had to be seen to be drafted by his party back into the Prime Minister's office.
 Hawker is now openly connected to the Rudd campaign's camp and helped advise Rudd that night.
 Should Rudd force a ballot? I don't know exactly how this is going to be played out.
  Hawke gathered her up, telling her Don't cry, don't cry.
