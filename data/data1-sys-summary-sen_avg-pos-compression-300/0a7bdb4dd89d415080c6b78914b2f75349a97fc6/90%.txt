 This campaign is part of the city's comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention program, which includes sex education, increased access to birth control and partnerships with community-based organizations, said Samantha Levine, deputy press secretary for Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
 Planned Parenthood, an advocacy group and provider of reproductive health services and education, said Wednesday in a statement that the ads propagate stereotypes and fail to address the societal problems that lead to teen pregnancies.
