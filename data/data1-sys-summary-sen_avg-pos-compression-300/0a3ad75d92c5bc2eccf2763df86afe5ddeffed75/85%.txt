 Yes, we are alone, but we are surviving, Micheletti said.
 The organization said police fired tear gas Tuesday at a building housing a prominent human rights organization.
  Many were there to denounce what they said were police abuse while breaking up the demonstration outside the Brazilian Embassy, the rights group said.
 Despite local reports citing police officials that authorities turned off the power to the embassy and surrounding area ostensibly to discourage looting, Micheletti said that a congregation of pro-Zelaya protesters at the embassy short-circuited the power themselves.
 As of Wednesday, power was restored to the building, Micheletti said.
 Micheletti said that the police were there because the people inside the embassy requested the protection, and said, We are not impeding the exit nor the entrance of absolutely anybody.
