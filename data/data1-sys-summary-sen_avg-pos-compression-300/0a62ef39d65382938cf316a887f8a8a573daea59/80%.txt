 Families of soldiers who disappeared during the coup will be asked to come and identify their family members, Diarra said.
  Amadou Sanogo, who led the March 2012 coup, was arrested, charged with complicity in kidnapping.
  We do not know which group the soldiers in the grave belonged to, Diarra said.
