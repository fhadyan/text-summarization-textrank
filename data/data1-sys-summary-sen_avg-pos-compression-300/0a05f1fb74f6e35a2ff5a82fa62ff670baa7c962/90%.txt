Rogue trader's impact on UBS.
  The bank declined to comment on the arrest.
  Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year, said van Dam.
 A bank's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader's activities, he said.
 UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated.
 UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said.
 He favors that alternative, he said.
  The banks are too large, van Dam said.
 The bank is large enough to take a $2 billion hit, experts said.
