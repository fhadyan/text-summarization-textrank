Credit rating agency Moody's has said it is looking at UBS for a possible downgrade.
 Rogue trader's impact on UBS.
 The European Central Bank, along with the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, said three U.S. dollar auctions would be held to help out European banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt.
  Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year, said van Dam.
 A bank's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader's activities, he said.
 UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated.
 UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said.
 He favors that alternative, he said.
  The banks are too large, van Dam said.
 The bank is large enough to take a $2 billion hit, experts said.
