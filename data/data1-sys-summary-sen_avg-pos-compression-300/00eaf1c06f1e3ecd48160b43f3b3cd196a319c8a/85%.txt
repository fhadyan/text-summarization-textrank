Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes.
 Biochar helps clean the air two ways: by preventing rotting biomass from releasing harmful CO2 into the atmosphere, and by allowing plants to safely store CO2 they pull out of the air during photosynthesis.
  Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere, said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar.
 Thousands of years later, the terra preta soil remains fertile without need for any added fertilizer, experts say.
