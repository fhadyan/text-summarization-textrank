Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes.
  Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere, said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar.
 The process of making biochar can also lead to other valuable products.
  They can become the new affluent.
