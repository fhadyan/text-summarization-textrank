Washington Naif Al-Mutawa anticipated a struggle when he launched an Islam-inspired comic book series that he hoped would become a symbol of tolerance.
 Al-Mutawa and his team have now raised more than $40 million in venture capital for the project.
 According to Al-Mutawa, the criticism spooked The Hub.
 But Al-Mutawa says criticisms of burqas are evidence that, for some people anything to do with Islam is bad.
 Al-Mutawa is also trying to gain distribution for his TV series in France and other countries, but his main focus remains the United States.
