Washington Naif Al-Mutawa anticipated a struggle when he launched an Islam-inspired comic book series that he hoped would become a symbol of tolerance.
 Al-Mutawa and his team have now raised more than $40 million in venture capital for the project.
 According to Al-Mutawa, the criticism spooked The Hub.
 But Al-Mutawa says criticisms of burqas are evidence that, for some people anything to do with Islam is bad.
 Citing The Hub holdup, Solotaroff says the project is now stuck in the most important market for The 99. .
 Al-Mutawa is also trying to gain distribution for his TV series in France and other countries, but his main focus remains the United States.
  The series features 99 superheroes from across the globe who team up to combat villains and who embody what Al-Mutawa calls basic human values like trust and generosity.
