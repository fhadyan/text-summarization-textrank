 Think again.
  I get it.
 And this lack of mentorship while in school may lead to an achievement gap in the workplace.
  There's still a huge disparity between the percentage of Asians graduating at the top of their class from the best schools in the country and the percentage of Asians who go on to achieve top leadership positions in their chosen fields.
  Mentors and mentees are too often arbitrarily paired in the corporate world.
  But it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers in academia, the corporate world, public service, media, entertainment and the arts, whatever path talented young people might choose to recognize the subtle, unconscious biases that sometimes prevent Asians from achieving their true potential.
 Maybe then Asians in America can be recognized for bringing more to the table than just being good at school.
  But more surprising was the high level of racial bias against Asians and Indians professors were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these students.
  A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group.
