Spector's wife, Rachelle, was in the courtroom to hear the verdict Monday, as was Clarkson's mother, Donna.
  Jurors deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction.
 But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace.
 Spector's retrial began in October.
 Asked if he agreed to the sentencing date, Spector quietly answered, Yes.
 Prosecutor Alan Jackson said he believed the jury reached the correct verdict, and he acknowledged the strength and backing of Clarkson's family.
  But defense attorney Doron Weinberg said Spector's defense team disagreed and planned to appeal.
 Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing, citing Spector's years-long pattern of violence involving firearms.
