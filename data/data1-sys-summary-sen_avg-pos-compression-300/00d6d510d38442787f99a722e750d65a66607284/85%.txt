 Chennai, India.
 Vegetarian thalis (platters with a few curries, rice dishes and breads) cost less than a Starbucks latte.
 We recommend: Madras restaurant for delicious South Indian home-style cooking.

 Even those that aren't vegetarian-specific offer meatless tom yum soup, pad thai, salads and coconut-milk based curries.
  Curries are served on banana leaves.

 We recommend: Traditional Korean vegetarian restaurant Hangwachae in Seoul serves house-made condiments from chili paste to soy bean paste.
 The artfully composed dishes look like they belong in a museum.
