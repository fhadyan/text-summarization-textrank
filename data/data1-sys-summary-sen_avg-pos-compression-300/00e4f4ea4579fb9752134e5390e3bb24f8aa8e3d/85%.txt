 (Kakira) started expanding every 10 years, every 20 years, modernizing, acquiring more land, introducing irrigation, expanding the crushing capacity.
  All industries collapsed, all international trade collapsed.
  There are many challenges in this business, Banuli says.
  Within a few years Kakira Sugar Industries had collapsed, but so had infrastructure in Uganda.
  Social services, everything had collapsed.
  The factory was a skeleton, Barungi said.
 Besides nearly 8,000 staff members, Kakira has almost as many contract workers in the shape of farmers, like Mwanja Banuli.
  To be able to sustain business you want agricultural farmers, plantation workers, you want factory workers and the vision of Muljibhai Mudhvani was to develop human resources, Barungi said.
  The excess can go and work in other industries in the country, Barungi said.
 In Uganda, sugar is big business.
