 The nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe, meeting heightened safety regulations introduced by the nuclear watchdog following the Fukushima disaster.
 But the court ruled that the new safety standards were loose, lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant, an official said.

 Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Tuesday that the country's nuclear watchdog had deemed the plant safe according to the world's strictest safety standards.
