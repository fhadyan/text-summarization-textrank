 Marco Rubio is all in.
 Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.
  But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.
 Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.
 Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.
 Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.
  He holds little appeal to Latino voters.
 Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.
 Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
