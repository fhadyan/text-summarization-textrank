 Marco Rubio is all in.
  He is a fierce opponent of Obamacare and wants the law repealed.
 Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.
 Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.
  He holds little appeal to Latino voters.
 Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.
 Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
