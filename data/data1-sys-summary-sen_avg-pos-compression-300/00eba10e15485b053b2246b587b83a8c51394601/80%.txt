In a separate interview Friday with CNN, Tehran Boldon said that his brother's son is a limousine driver on the Las Vegas Strip and he called his father to warn him to avoid the area after seeing a car afire not realizing that the taxi on fire belonged to his father.
  We lost a real patriarch and brother, said Tehran Boldon.
  The father's body was burned beyond recognition and was identified by his cab assignment, Tehran Boldon said.
  The office wasn't releasing further information Friday about Boldon or his passenger.
 Cherry had two children, she said.

 The shots were fired from the Range Rover, which Las Vegas police spokesman Bill Cassell said could be anywhere.
 The Maserati continued into the intersection of the boulevard and Flamingo Road and collided with a taxi, which caught fire, killing cab driver Michael Boldon, 62, CNN affiliate KVVU said.
