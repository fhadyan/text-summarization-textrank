 Aggressive behavior toward women isn't innate.
 Ram eventually adopted a new outlook; that truly strong men don't show power, they show care.
 Now I'm not saying men doing laundry is the solution.

  A World Health Organization global survey found that 59% of women in rural Ethiopia report being subjected to sexual violence from their intimate partner, 62% of women in Peru report physical violence at the hands of their partners and 30% of women in rural Bangladesh say their first sexual experience was forced.
 I was disappointed to see they had invited only the heads of girls' schools.
  But along the way, I've also met countless men who, given an opportunity, were willing to examine and improve their behavior towards the girls and women in their lives.
