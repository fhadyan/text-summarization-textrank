Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic once again faces two genocide charges instead of one in his long-running trial over ethnic violence during the 1990s Balkan wars.
 The 1992-95 Bosnian conflict was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia.
 Karadzic was captured in 2008 after more than 13 years of hiding in plain sight in Belgrade.
 Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic also faced charges connected with the Balkan wars, but he died in 2006 while on trial at The Hague.
 Karadzic, whose trial began in 2010, also faces nine other charges related to ethnic violence during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
