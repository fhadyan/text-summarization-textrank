There is little danger the drones could have made it far into South Korea.
 The type of drone is not used for long-range missions, a defense analyst said.
  They're just a militarized version of that, Hardy said.
 North Korea has flaunted similar, larger UAVs at military parades in recent years, and some of them have been spiked with explosives, Hardy said.
 North Korea also warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device.
 They were launched in North Korea from three locations, South Korea's defense ministry said: Near the Kaesong area, 27 kilometers southeast of Haeju and 17 kilometers from Pyonggak.
 Kim said Seoul will send a warning via the United Nations to Pyongyang and tighten air defenses as a response to the drones.
 Ministry of National Defense officials in Seoul immediately suspected that the sky-blue colored fliers belonged to Pyongyang.
 Scientists found a smoking gun that all three were sent from North Korea and are programmed to return to North Korea, South Korean defense spokesman Kim Min-soek said.
 Photos the drones took along on their journey corroborate their flight path, he said.
