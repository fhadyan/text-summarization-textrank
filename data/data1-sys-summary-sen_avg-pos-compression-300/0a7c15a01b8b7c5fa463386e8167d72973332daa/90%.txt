Leaders of Libya's interim government have said Gadhafi was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him Thursday.
 An amateur video distributed by the Reuters news agency Sunday showed NTC fighters congratulating a man the fighters say killed Gadhafi.
  CNN could not independently verify that claim.
  More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi was shot in the head, dying moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, citing the city's coroner.
