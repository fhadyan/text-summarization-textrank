Barca's Spain striker David Villa and Real's Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil were red-carded for their involvement in the melee, despite both players having already been substituted.
 Barca regained the lead on the brink of half-time, when Messi found the net following a neat back-heel from center-back Gerard Pique.
