Laura's parents are happy about Friday's decision, family lawyer Peter de Lange said.
 Laura believes she will be able to convince the court that she is fit to make the trip alone, de Lange said.
 Laura Dekker's parents support her round-the-world ambition, which sparked concern from child protection officials because of her age.
 Another sailor, Robin Knox-Johnston, also said age shouldn't be the only determining factor.
 The move prevents the parents from permitting Laura to set off on her trip alone, though Laura will remain at home with her father, Dick Dekker, a court official said.
