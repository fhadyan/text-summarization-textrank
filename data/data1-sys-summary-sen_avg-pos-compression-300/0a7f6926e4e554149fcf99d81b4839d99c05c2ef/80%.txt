LOS ANGELES, California Michael Jackson's ex-wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, has agreed not to challenge the singer's mother for custody of the children, according to a joint statement from lawyers for Rowe and Katherine Jackson.
 Debbie Rowe will not pursue custody of the children she bore with Michael Jackson, a lawyer says.
  Katherine Jackson is asking the court for more involvement in the estate's business.
  Jackson and Debbie Rowe were on the exact same page, McMillan said.
 McMillan, in a statement issued Wednesday, said Katherine Jackson was not disputing the will.
 He said the executors have either denied Mrs.
 The couple divorced in 1999 with Rowe giving Jackson full custody while she got an $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents.
  Jackson later agreed to additional support.
 Katherine Jackson gained temporary guardianship of the three children soon after his death last month.
