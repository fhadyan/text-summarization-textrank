In real court, however, the rules are different.
  Huth's attorneys should have complied with these rules.
 Cosby breaks his silence.
 Huth filed her complaint long after the time permitted by the statute of limitations.
  She didn't.
  Her attorneys filed her Complaint naming Cosby.
  Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission.
 Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there.
  But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.
 Cosby and his attorneys are not going quietly into the good night.
