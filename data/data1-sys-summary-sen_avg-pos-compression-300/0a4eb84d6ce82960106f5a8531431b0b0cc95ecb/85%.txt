In real court, however, the rules are different.
  Huth's attorneys should have complied with these rules.
 Cosby breaks his silence.
 Huth filed her complaint long after the time permitted by the statute of limitations.
 Huth claims she and a 16-year-old friend met Cosby at a Los Angeles-area film shoot.
  Cosby's attorneys correctly point out that Huth failed to file the requisite certificates, which exposes the complaint itself to attack.
 Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit.
  She didn't.
  Her attorneys filed her Complaint naming Cosby.
  Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission.
 Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there.
  But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.
 Cosby and his attorneys are not going quietly into the good night.
