Kathmandu, Nepal A ferocious leopard may have killed 15 people in Nepal in a 15-month span, its latest victim a 4-year-old boy that the creature dragged away into the jungle to eat The head of boy was found in the forest a kilometer from his home Saturday morning, said Kamal Prasad Kharel, the police chief of the Baitadi district, an area about 600 kilometers (373 miles) west of Kathmandu  It could be the same leopard, he said  No adult male has been killed, Kharel said After killing its victim, the leopard takes the body away into the forest to eat The chief district administrator has granted permission for this particular leopard to be killed  Most leopards live on wild prey  Since human blood has more salt than animal blood, once wild animals get the taste of salty blood they do not like other animals like deer, Dhakal said Kharel said he feared the actual number of people killed by the leopard could be higher than 15, because others have lost their life to leopard attacks in Uttarkhand state in northern India, which borders Baitadi district
