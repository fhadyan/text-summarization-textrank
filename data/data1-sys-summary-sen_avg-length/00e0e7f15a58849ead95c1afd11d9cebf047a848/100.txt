I'm talking about breaking the habit of faking knowledge in order to save face  Politicians routinely face shame if they confess to not knowing  Such behavior is apparently endemic Her students, anxious to deliver the right answer, would demand clarification  You decide  But we won't ever achieve equity let alone excellence if we don't also work to make our schools places where we all feel safe saying I don't know  Pressure to know the right answer (or, more precisely, to appear to know) isn't limited to the classroom
