 Over the past few weeks almost a third of all Americans headed back to classrooms from early learning centers to universities, as students and as teachers accompanied by the usual seasonal mix of joys and jitters  Or perhaps not Lately it seems we've been inundated with bad news: The nation's report card is crummy; schools are broke and failing; graduates can't find jobs  And with competition for resources putting increased pressure on standardized test scores, cheating scandals have become practically ho-hum  Among all these headlines resides a more quietly sobering fact: This year's high school graduates will be the first educated entirely under the No Child Left Behind Act In other words, a whole generation of kids who've grown up with an emphasis on multiple choice testing, who've been taught that knowing the one right answer is more important than the process of inquiry, who've learned that admitting I don't know is a crime But the problem isn't simply with a narrowly conceived educational policy  Pressure to know the right answer (or, more precisely, to appear to know) isn't limited to the classroom  It's pervasive throughout our culture a reality at once daunting and hopeful  Maybe even starting today
