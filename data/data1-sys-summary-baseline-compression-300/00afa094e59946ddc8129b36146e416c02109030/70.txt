Yangon, Myanmar When Burmese commuters have an accident they don't dial 911 or any ordinary emergency service They call the country's version of Marlon Brando, a heartthrob in the 1980s and 90s who turned his back on the film industry to run a fleet of ambulances and bury the nation's dead A household name in Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, Kyaw Thu has starred in more than 200 films, and even took home a Myanmar Academy Award in 1994 for best actor in Da-Byi-Thu Ma Shwe Hta He followed it up with best director for Amay No Bo in 2003, but by then his head had already been turned by the story of an old woman left to die alone in hospital  The doctor warned the patient's family that she was close to death  After that they disappeared  A few days later she passed away so this dead body had no owner, Kyaw Thu told CNN at this office on the outskirts of Yangon, Myanmar's largest city He later found out that the woman's family couldn't afford a funeral service  At the time, it wasn't uncommon; poor families would often sneak out in the dead of night to bury their dead, he said And so began the Free Funeral Service Society, founded in collaboration with multi-award winning late Burmese writer and director Thukha, which now also provides a free library, education, medical, dental care and disaster relief From films to funerals Kyaw Thu's decision to leave the film industry wasn't entirely his own  In 2007, he was arrested and later banned from the film industry after being accused of supporting the Saffron Revolution That year, the Myanmar military staged a violent crackdown on the largest anti-government demonstrations since 1988  Led by monks, tens of thousands of Burmese marched through the streets to protest plans to cut fuel subsidies He says he's on better terms with the current government led by President Thein Sein, who came to power in 2011, ending 50 years of military rule
