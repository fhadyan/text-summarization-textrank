 CNN reported Monday on the heart-rending story of Emily Bauer, a teenager from Houston, who suffered a debilitating stroke after consuming what has come to be known as synthetic marijuana Although the role that synthetic marijuana played in Emily's medical condition is not yet clear, what is clear is that these new chemicals might not even exist if it weren't for the prohibition of marijuana, a plant that has been widely consumed throughout the world for thousands of years  A few years ago, people started using synthetic marijuana to evade drug tests and it caught on, once news reports publicized its existence And even though President Obama and 41 governors have signed legislation criminalizing various forms of synthetic marijuana, this stuff isn't going away that is, until we legally regulate marijuana itself To understand drug use by teenagers, we must acknowledge that they have grown up with drugs everywhere  And despite the draconian punishments associated with illegal drugs, 44% of today's teens will try them before graduating from high school Tobacco has contributed to more deaths than alcohol and illicit drugs combined
