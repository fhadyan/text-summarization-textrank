 As a psychiatrist, former university president and advocate for Arab women in science, Rafia Ghubash is one of the United Arab Emirates' most influential women But her latest project is possibly her most ambitious yet: creating the Middle East's first museum dedicated to the achievements of women The museum, Bait al Banaat, or House of Women, in Dubai was officially opened at the end of 2012 by Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, showcasing the contribution of women to the country's history  Women here were empowered a long time ago, but haven't had a chance to tell our story, said Ghubash  Don't think because we are covered we are not empowered  Women here were not in the media, but they were economically engaged and running businesses The museum is the culmination of five years' work for Ghubash, who financed the museum with $3 million of her own money  It was nice to have people with different backgrounds involved, she said
