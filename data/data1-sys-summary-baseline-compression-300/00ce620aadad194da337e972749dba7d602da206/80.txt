 So we thought Asian kids did great in school  Think again A new study suggests that women and minorities are less likely to receive early support from potential academic mentors  Researchers from Wharton, Columbia and NYU ran an interesting field experiment: Pretending to be students, they e-mailed more than 6500 professors at top U  universities admiring each professor's work and asking to meet  The e-mails were all identical except for the senders' names Names that one can associate with a gender or race like Brad Anderson, Meredith Roberts, LaToya Brown, Juanita Martinez, Deepak Patel, Sonali Desai, Chang Wong, and Mei Chen were used The researchers found that faculty were most likely to respond to e-mails from white males  But more surprising was the high level of racial bias against Asians and Indians professors were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these students One of the researchers noted, We see tremendous bias against Asian students and that's not something we expected  We expect them to be treated quite well in academia
