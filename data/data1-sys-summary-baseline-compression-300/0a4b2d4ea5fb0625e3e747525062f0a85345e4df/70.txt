Port-au-Prince, Haiti In the central plaza, there was once an orgy of music, street dancing and revelry unmatched by any other nation in the Americas, Haitians say But where there was joy now sits a vast settlement of people left without loved ones, without homes, without life's belongings Haitians have celebrated Carnival through dictatorships, military coups and bloodshed  Popular belief was that if a government failed to deliver on Carnival, Haiti's equivalent of Mardi Gras, it was sure to fall, said Marie Laurence Lassegue, Haiti's minister of culture and information But this year, the three-day festival has been canceled, another indication of the enormity of the earthquake's devastation Musicians fell silent, seamstresses stopped sewing costumes and ghostly skeletons of unfinished floats lay scattered on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince  A month after the devastating January 12 earthquake, the Champs de Mars plaza is home to the capital's displaced, where thousands of people have eked out a tiny space in which to survive Full coverage of the earthquake's aftermath  This is the first time Carnival is not happening, said Roberto Martino, lead singer of popular Kompa band T-Vice  I don't even think about music anymore Less than a week ahead of Carnival's start on Sunday, revelry is replaced with mourning  The nation's foremost concert producer, Charles Jubert, died  So did members of four bands who were practicing inside a studio that collapsed  Other musicians lost legs, arms and hands  They will not be able to play again  Maybe when we are finished crying  There, she can bathe properly
