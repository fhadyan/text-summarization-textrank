 Can a movie actually convince you to support torture? Can a movie really persuade you that fracking a process used to drill for natural gas is a danger to the environment? Can a movie truly cause you to view certain minority groups in a negative light? Some scoff at the notion that movies do anything more than entertain  They are wrong  Sure, it's unlikely that one movie alone will change your views on issues of magnitude  But a movie (or TV show) can begin your education or miseducation on a topic  And for those already agreeing with the film's thesis, it can further entrench your views Anyone who doubts the potential influence that movies can have on public opinion need to look no further than two films that are causing an uproar even before they have opened nationwide  They present hot button issues that manage to fire up people from the left and right The first, Zero Dark Thirty, is about the pursuit and killing of Osama bin Laden, which features scenes of torture  The second, Promised Land, stars Matt Damon and explores how the use of fracking to drill for natural gas can pose health and environmental dangers Critics of Zero Dark Thirty fear that audiences will accept as true the film's story line that torture was effective in eliciting information to locate bin Laden
