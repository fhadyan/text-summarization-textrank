 Lewis Hamilton realistically can't win the title but the former world champion hopes to challenge powerhouse Sebastian Vettel at the Korean Grand Prix after posting the fastest practice times Friday Hamilton's time of one minute, 38 673 seconds in the second session in Yeongam was about one-tenth of a second quicker than Vettel, the triple reigning world champion who has captured the last two races in Korea  It's the first time I can remember that second practice has really gone well for me, Mercedes' Hamilton was quoted as saying by Formula One's website  We haven't changed anything but the day just went smoothly and all the processes with the team worked well  I love this track Autosport
