 An official in Inner Mongolia is disputing an Amnesty International report that parts of the region are under martial law  We did not enforce martial law  Everything is normal, said Chao Lumen, an official with the information department of Xilingol prefecture In the report released Friday, Amnesty International detailed protests in and around the city of Xilinhot, the prefecture's seat of government  Nothing happened here  There were no demonstrations or protests, Chao said Monday The Amnesty report said Chinese authorities declared martial law in some parts of the autonomous region in an apparent response to days of protests The region has long been the scene of ethnic tension between Mongolians, who have lived in the area for centuries, and the Han people, who arrived in larger numbers after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949
