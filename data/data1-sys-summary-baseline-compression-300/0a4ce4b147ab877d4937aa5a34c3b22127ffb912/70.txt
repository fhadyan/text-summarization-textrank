 The deadly attack in Kabul on Shi'ite worshippers celebrating the feast of Ashura adds one more layer to the country's overlapping security crises  And they evoke violent sectarian rivalries in Iraq and Pakistan, where animosity between Sunni and Shia runs deep  Afghanistan has its own cultural rifts between ethnic Pashtun and Tajik, for example but it's rare to see such an explosion of religiously motivated violence Kate Clark, with the Afghan Analysts Network in Kabul, described the attack as a real shock  Whatever else has happened in the past 30 years we haven't had this sort of sectarian attack aimed at killing lots of people, she told CNN by phone from the Afghan capital The first claim of responsibility for the bombing in the Afghan capital has come from a militant Sunni group in Pakistan with a history of sectarian attacks against Shia  A man identifying himself as a spokesman for Lashkar-e-Janghvi al Almi, a group with links to al Qaeda and the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack in a call to Radio Mashaal, a Pashto-language station in Pakistan sponsored by the United States government  A similar call was reportedly made to the BBC's Urdu-language service The group is an offshoot of the powerful Lashkar-e-Janghvi (LeJ which has a record of high-profile suicide bombings in Pakistan, including the attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad in 2008  Al-Almi's most destructive attack to date was a double suicide bombing in northwest Pakistan last year  The bombers wearing burkas killed 42 people belonging to tribes that opposed the Pakistan Taliban, also known for its antipathy toward Shia
