WASHINGTON The White House Wednesday said it was puzzled by a former spokesman's memoir in which he accuses the Bush administration of being mired in propaganda and political spin and at times playing loose with the truth Former White House spokesman Scott McClellan blasts President Bush and advisers in a new book In excerpts from a 341-page book to be released Monday, Scott McClellan writes on the war in Iraq that Bush and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war  [I]n this regard, he was terribly ill-served by his top advisers, especially those involved directly in national security, McClellan wrote White House spokeswoman Dana Perino called McClellan's description of his time at the White House sad  Read excerpts from the book Â»  Scott, we now know, is disgruntled about his experience at the White House, Perino said  For those of us who fully supported him, before, during and after he was press secretary, we are puzzled  It is sad  This is not the Scott we knew McClellan's former White House colleagues had harsher reactions to McClellan's book Frances Townsend, former Homeland Security adviser to Bush, said advisers to the president should speak up when they have policy concerns  Scott never did that on any of these issues as best I can remember or as best as I know from any of my White House colleagues, said Townsend, now a CNN contributor  For him to do this now strikes me as self-serving, disingenuous and unprofessional Clarke left government in 2003
