Editor's note: (Global Mail) The night Bob Hawke lost the Labor leadership 20-odd years ago, I was a tender recruit to the Canberra press gallery who found myself, fortuitously, marooned at the Prime Minister's office door whilst the Labor caucus was dispatching the occupant Mistaken by security guards then hastily clearing nearby corridors as a Prime Ministerial staffer, I was left to witness Hawke's return to his office and his waiting family as an ex-Prime Minister, at that time the only one to be rejected by his own party Hawke came striding out of the caucus room, chin forward, moist eyes straight ahead, a clutch of dejected staff trailing behind  At the same moment his office door opened and out burst his then-wife, Hazel, sobbing  Either she'd been expecting the worst or, more probably, there had been a phone call telegraphing it She flung herself at her husband  Hawke gathered her up, telling her Don't cry, don't cry  And as he disappeared into his office, he barked: I need a bloody cup of tea If the humiliation of that evening's historic rejection winded him, Hawke didn't show it Soon afterwards trolleys of liquor were rolling along the corridors of Parliament House and Hawke hosted a wake that went for hours, open to all comers  He angered, in my sight, only once that night; he rounded on a particular reporter who had showered him with sympathy but who, in Hawke's view, had been long doing the bidding of the victor, Paul Keating Australian FM Kevin Rudd resigns Never before had the Labor Party dumped a serving Prime Minister, yet Hawke's equanimity outwardly at least was striking  You might have said he seemed both resigned and liberated about the loss of the job he'd held for nearly nine years  Of course, the long contest with Keating had been aggravating to Hawke and sapping for his Government; Keating had effectively launched his challenge late the year before, in 1990, when he contended, in his Pl cido Domingo speech, that Australia had never had a great Prime Minister  Then he challenged Hawke in mid-1991, lost and went to the back bench until his second and successful challenge at the end of that year Hawke, the Labor Party and most Australians knew that Keating had Hawke lined up for the kill Not so Kevin Rudd It has been an undeclared, subterranean campaign to reinstall Rudd in the Prime Minister's office one from which the candidate has, until now, been able to stay aloof Gillard calls for Australian Labor Party leadership vote  The reasons are two-fold
