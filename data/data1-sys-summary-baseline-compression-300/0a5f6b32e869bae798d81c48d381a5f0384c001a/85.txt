Editor's note: (Global Mail) The night Bob Hawke lost the Labor leadership 20-odd years ago, I was a tender recruit to the Canberra press gallery who found myself, fortuitously, marooned at the Prime Minister's office door whilst the Labor caucus was dispatching the occupant Mistaken by security guards then hastily clearing nearby corridors as a Prime Ministerial staffer, I was left to witness Hawke's return to his office and his waiting family as an ex-Prime Minister, at that time the only one to be rejected by his own party Hawke came striding out of the caucus room, chin forward, moist eyes straight ahead, a clutch of dejected staff trailing behind  At the same moment his office door opened and out burst his then-wife, Hazel, sobbing  Either she'd been expecting the worst or, more probably, there had been a phone call telegraphing it She flung herself at her husband  Hawke gathered her up, telling her Don't cry, don't cry  And as he disappeared into his office, he barked: I need a bloody cup of tea If the humiliation of that evening's historic rejection winded him, Hawke didn't show it Australian FM Kevin Rudd resigns Hawke, the Labor Party and most Australians knew that Keating had Hawke lined up for the kill
