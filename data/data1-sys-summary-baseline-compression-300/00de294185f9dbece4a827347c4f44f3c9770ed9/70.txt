Washington In one ill-fated fundraiser, Mitt Romney managed to offend Palestinians, Latinos and some of the same people he's counting on for support if he wants to unseat President Barack Obama It isn't the first time Romney's oratory fumbles have put his campaign on its heels, handed opponents material to push the stereotype of him as an out-of-touch businessman and provoked members of the party's conservative base to question his worthiness as their standard-bearer  Everybody has the same reaction: 'dumb, dumb, dumb said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, adding that Romney's gaffes reinforce a sitcom-like caricature of the candidate Opinion: What's wrong with Romney After the tape, recorded during a May 17 private fundraiser at the home of Sun Capital executive Marc Leder, made the rounds on Monday, Romney convened a hastily scheduled news conference Monday night in which he said his comments were off the cuff and not elegantly stated However, he defended the main message of his remarks, saying he that while he could have made them more clearly, he said he was trying to point out the differences between his and Obama's campaigns Democratic pundits gloated and were content to let Romney's words speak for themselves  I mean, I don't think Democrats had much to say at all  I mean, there wasn't much left to say, Democratic strategist Richard Socarides said on CNN's Early Start  Look, I mean, I think that, you know, big picture, this is a was a devastating moment for Governor Romney, potentially fatal, as people start to focus on this campaign Narratives at work Another Democratic strategist said that Romney's comments played into the two narratives that they have pushed: First, that he doesn't care about the middle class  Well, thanks for the help, Mitt, Paul Begala, a CNN contributor and a senior adviser in the leading pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, said on CNN's AC360  On the second front in order to give big tax cuts for the rich, Mitt Romney is going to have to raise taxes on the middle class  Well, when you're claiming to wealthy people that 47 percent of Americans don't pay federal income tax, I think a lot of those people, retirees, working class folks are going to listen to that and think, 'Gee, I guess the Democrats are right  I guess he does want to raise the taxes on the middle class in order to help the rich  Republican strategist Margaret Hoover, who served in the Bush White House, said the comments would wound Romney but it wouldn't be a fatal one Video threatens Romney campaign  You can understand while he tripped over his words, it probably wasn't characterized the best way  I think we can all agree with that, she said on Early Start  You can understand what he was trying to say Reaction from other conservatives was mixed Romney campaign responds Series of gaffes
