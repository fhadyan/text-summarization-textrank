SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) Sony has cut the price of the PlayStation 3 by $100, or 17 percent, in the United States, a move that should boost the video game console's lackluster sales Starting Monday, the current PS3 60 gigabyte model will cost $499 a $100 price drop The PlayStation 3, which includes a 60-gigabyte hard drive and a Blu-ray high-definition DVD player, will now cost $500, or $20 more than the most expensive version of Microsoft's Xbox 360 The PS3 still costs twice that of Nintendo's Wii console, whose $250 price and motion-sensing controller have made it a best-seller despite its lack of cutting-edge graphics and hard disk  Our initial expectation is that sales should double at a minimum, Jack Tretton, chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment America, said in an interview  It's a pretty consumer-friendly move, Pachter said  E-mail to a friend Copyright 2007 Reuters
