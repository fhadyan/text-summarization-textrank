After several months of airstrikes, the international coalition's operation against ISIS in Syria has failed to dismantle the group's structure of command and has pushed its militants further beyond the country's borders Civilians and opposition rebel forces have been left frustrated by the coalition's narrow focus, lack of a clear agenda and apparent failure to take into consideration the dynamics of the wider Syrian conflict Late last month, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said that without U  Security Council approval, the U  strikes lacked legitimacy  But in comments to media he said: Anyway, if their aim is to strike against ISIS, it's OK Does this statement mean that the Syrian government views the coalition strikes as beneficial to its hold on power? Does the old Arab proverb the enemy of my enemy is my friend apply to this case and to the reality on the ground? In the short term, the international coalition's counter-terrorism strategy may certainly be in the interests of the Assad regime Military strikes are to some extent forcing ISIS fighters to retreat from territories under their control in northern and eastern Syria Other opposition groups including the Free Syrian Army are unlikely to have the capability to take advantage of these strikes  and Western allies have made it clear that regime change is not an objective of this military campaign
