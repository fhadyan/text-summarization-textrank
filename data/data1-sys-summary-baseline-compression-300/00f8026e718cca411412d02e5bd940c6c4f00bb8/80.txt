Washington The much-maligned, color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System is about to be consigned to the proverbial dustbin of history Not that anyone is really paying attention Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is expected to announce Thursday that the almost 9-year-old threat alert system will go away in April  It will be replaced by the new National Terror Advisory System that will focus on specific threats in geographical areas, a department source said Wednesday The source did not provide details of the new system, which Napolitano will unveil at what the department is calling the first annual 'State of America's Homeland Security' address at George Washington University The top Democrat and Republican on the House Homeland Security Commission reacted positively to the news, although committee chairman Rep  Peter King, R-New York, reserved judgment on the specifics  Though the system served a valuable purpose in the terrible days and months following the terrorist attacks of September 11, it was clearly time for the current color-coded system to be replaced with a more targeted system, King said  I know they have been working on this for a long time  It sounds to me like the changes they are proposing make sense  We will have to wait and see how they implement this new, more targeted system  Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi
