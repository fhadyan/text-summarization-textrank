 Egypt has agreed to allow two Iranian warships to cross through the Suez Canal in a move that puts the country's new military regime in a prickly position with its Israeli neighbor The post-Hosni Mubarak caretaker government gave the green light to the Iranian warships Friday, state media reported  They are expected to be the first Iranian warships to sail through the Suez since the Islamic republic's 1979 revolution The canal is an internal body of water, and as such, Egypt has sovereignty over it  But Egypt also is bound by the 1978 Camp David Accords, which guarantee the right of free passage by ships belonging to Israel and all other nations on the basis of the Constantinople Convention of 1888  Before that, Egypt did not allow Israeli ships to sail through the canal Last week, Egypt's newly empowered military government said it would honor all its international treaties  That would include Camp David  This is awkward at a minimum, said David Schenker, director of the Program on Arab Politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy
