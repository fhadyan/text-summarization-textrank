St Petersburg, Russia Most artistic directors' first day leading a new ballet company is all about meeting the dancers  But for Nacho Duato it's a challenge just to find the rehearsal room The mazelike corridors of the magnificent Mikhailovsky Theatre in St Petersburg prove confusing and inspire a few unchoregraphed twists and turns from Duato before he finally identifies the right room and his new company the 140 dancers of the Mikhailovsky Ballet It's unlikely the theater's floor plan will be the last challenge for the Spanish choreographer who, this month, took over leadership of the company He's the first foreigner to lead a Russian ballet company in over a century and has been charged with bringing modern choreography to the Mikhailovsky's classical repertoire  I think they have it pretty clear that they want to change; that they want something new  Russians love ballet  Why not? Maybe we can do it
