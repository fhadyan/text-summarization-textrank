ATHENS, Georgia Over the railroad tracks, near Agriculture Drive on the University of Georgia campus, sits a unique machine that may hold one of the solutions to big environmental problems like energy, food production and even global climate change Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes  This machine right here is our baby, said UGA research engineer Brian Bibens, who is one of a handful of researchers around the world working on alternative ways to recycle carbon Bibens' specialty is biochar, a highly porous charcoal made from organic waste  The raw material can be any forest, agricultural or animal waste  Some examples are woodchips, corn husks, peanut shells, even chicken manure Bibens feeds the waste called biomass into an octagonally shaped metal barrel where it is cooked under intense heat, sometimes above 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, the organic matter is cooked through a thermochemical process called pyrolysis  In a few hours, organic trash is transformed into charcoal-like pellets farmers can turn into fertilizer  Gasses given off during the process can be harnesed to fuel vehicles of power electric generators  Watch how biochar is made and why it's important »  See more about how biochar works »
