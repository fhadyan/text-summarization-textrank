As families prepare for air travel this coming Memorial Day weekend, United Airlines won't be offering early boarding to families in coach with small children Joining a handful of other carriers, United made the policy shift in late April with little fanfare Previously, families with small children flying coach were allowed on aircraft before general boarding, a convenience for moms and dads trying to herd their kids across the friendly skies  We figured it would be better to simplify that process and reduce the number of boarding groups, said United spokesman Charles Hobart  The airline does allow passengers with children traveling in first class or business class to board early  I have to wonder if it will end up slowing things down because of the extra time it takes for families to board, said Brett Snyder of the blog crankyflier Kate Hanni of flyersrights org calls the move very anti-family  I hope United changes their mind  If families do need additional assistance, our gate agent will work to accommodate them, Hobart said  That message has been communicated
