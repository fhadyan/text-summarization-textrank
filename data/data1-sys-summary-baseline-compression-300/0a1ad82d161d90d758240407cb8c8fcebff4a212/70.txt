BEIJING, China Soon after I first came to visit China in the autumn of 1971, I saw a contingent of militia soldiers doing marching drills in Tiananmen Square  I was told they were rehearsing for the annual National Day parade on October 1, which people eagerly awaited Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949 Weeks later, however, I was informed that the civilian and military parade had been cancelled in the spirit of simple-living and hard struggle, as Chairman Mao decreed  The real reason: Lin Biao, then defense minister and Mao's anointed successor, had reportedly died in a plane crash while attempting to flee the country after a failed coup attempt China's achievements in the last 60 years have come in zigs and zags  The best place to look back at what China went through in the past six decades is Tiananmen, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace  Behind it lies the Imperial Palace, or Forbidden City, where China's Emperors used to live  The emperor is now history, but Tiananmen remains Beijing's political center It was on the Tiananmen rostrum where Chairman Mao formally proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic  The Chinese people have stood up! he declared in a shrill Hunanese accent  For decades, the whole nation followed Mao loyally  He emphasized political mobilization of the common man, especially the peasantry  In Mao's ideology, the Chinese people found hope in a New China, wherein citizens would always have a bowl of rice to eat and clothes to wear Mao proved to be good at fighting but poor at governing  He pushed sweeping socio-economic initiatives and strident ideological campaigns, often with disastrous results  To rebel is justified! they proclaimed  Fireworks will cap the festivities
