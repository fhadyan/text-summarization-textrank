 In a place accustomed to tough stretches, this has been a particularly tough few days at the White House After emerging from the showdown over the Republican-led government shutdown relatively unscathed, the Obama administration finds itself under assault on three fronts: problems surrounding Obamacare, the revelations of the U  spying on allies, and the 2012 attack on the U S diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, the latter for which a senator has threatened to hold up all of the Obama administration's nominations The controversies are sure to fuel continued Republican attacks on President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies as the nation gears up for midterm elections next year, and the White House has portrayed the attacks as so much partisan chatter But to CNN senior political analyst David Gergen, they reflect the relative inexperience of the Obama White House  This is an administration that has been very, very good at its politics, but has never been very good at execution of policies from Day One, he said Monday  It's an administration which has some really smart people in it, and a lot of younger people  It doesn't have very many heavyweights The worst part for Obama may be figuring out what to do about it all not just the various individual fires, but more generally how to take control of his own government, CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said If you're the President, how do you make sure that subordinates aren't withholding information you should know? How do you strike the right balance, and explain it clearly, on things such as gathering intelligence versus maximizing privacy and protecting key relationships? And how do you make sure those tied to your administration avoid big missteps that could come back to bite you?  Four out of five Americans have little or no trust in their government to do anything right, Borger writes in an analysis  And now Obama probably feels the same way Does Obama still have faith in government? Here are the latest details on the issues causing the administration the most heartache today: Obamacare Another week, another congressional hearing on the problem-plagued rollout of Obama's health insurance program She offered the apology Tuesday in an appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee Obamacare website administrator apologizes NSA spying And Sen Benghazi
