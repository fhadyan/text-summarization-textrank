 The flight data and cockpit voice recorders from JetBlue Flight 191, which made an emergency landing this week, have been retrieved and will be analyzed, officials said Thursday The National Transportation Safety Board will download the data Friday, said spokeswoman Kelly Nantel  Information gleaned from them will be given to the FBI, she said Investigators are looking into the apparent midair meltdown of the captain, Clayton Osbon, whose remarks and erratic behavior Tuesday led the co-pilot to lock him out of the cockpit Crew and passengers subdued Osbon as he screamed and banged on the door so hard the first officer thought Osbon would come through, according to a federal criminal complaint filed Wednesday against Osbon The complaint says Osbon began making remarks during the flight that concerned the first officer, who is his co-pilot  Osbon yelled over the radio to air traffic control and instructed them to be quiet  Osbon turned off the radios in the aircraft, dimmed his monitors and sternly admonished the FO (first officer) for trying to talk on the radio, the U  attorney's office in the Northern District of Texas said in a written statement  When Osbon said 'we need to take a leap of faith the FO stated that he became very worried  Osbon told the FO that 'we're not going to Vegas and began giving what the FO described as a sermon It was not immediately known whether the alleged remarks are audible on the voice recorder  But federal regulations state that planes manufactured since 1991 must record cockpit chatter on microphones
