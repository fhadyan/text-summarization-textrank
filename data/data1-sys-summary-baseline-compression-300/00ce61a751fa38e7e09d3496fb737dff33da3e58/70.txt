 The melting glacial ice in places like the Alps, Greenland and the Himalayas is a dramatic visual document of how our planet's climate is changing S based environmental photographer James Balog, it is a vision he has spent more than six years trying to record and preserve After an assignment for National Geographic in Iceland in 2005, he was shocked by the changes taking place and wanted to find a way to capture what was going on, in the Arctic and glaciers elsewhere around the world The result has been a new documentary film, Chasing Ice, based on 36 time-lapse cameras looking at 16 different glaciers in locations in Alaska, Bolivia, Canada, France, Greenland, Iceland, Nepal, the Rocky Mountains and Switzerland  Each camera has been taking a photograph every half-an-hour during daylight, producing almost one million pictures in total Balog says putting the documentary together has changed his initial skepticism about climate change  What we've seen has been a complete shock  National Snow and Ice Data Center
