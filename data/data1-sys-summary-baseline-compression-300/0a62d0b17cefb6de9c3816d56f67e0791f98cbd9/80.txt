 When sheriff's deputies arrested Casey Anthony in 2008 over the death of her 2-year-old daughter, few would have anticipated it would end like this: just days after her trial, jailers arranging a clandestine release launching the Orlando woman back into a world where her story could make her rich or put her life in danger But that's precisely the scenario that will play out sometime Sunday when Anthony completes serving her time on four misdemeanor counts of misleading police Anthony, 25, was acquitted July 5 of murder and child neglect charges in the death of her daughter, Caylee, whose skeletal remains were found in 2008 in a wooded field  She was convicted on four counts of misleading police and was sentenced to four years in prison After serving nearly three years in prison while awaiting trial, she was ordered released this weekend The abrupt end to a criminal case that at times transfixed the nation resulted in anger and revulsion as well as donations of cash to her jailhouse account  That is not just going to happen Whatever she ends up doing, first she has to get out of jail It's also a concern for her attorneys
