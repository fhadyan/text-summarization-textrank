 Hating the Internal Revenue Service is an American pastime that transcends political affiliation This past May, disgust for the IRS reached an all-time high when Lois Lerner, director of the IRS's Exempt Organizations unit, disclosed the agency had improperly targeted social welfare organizations seeking special status under section 501(c 4) of the tax code based on their political ideology This revelation resulted in more than three months (and counting) of congressional hearings and investigations Read the IRS inspector general's report on targeting But in typical Washington fashion, the manufactured congressional outrage and grandstanding has served to do little more than obfuscate the real scandal at the IRS: that the agency allows social welfare organizations to manipulate federal tax law by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on political ads And that really is a scandal
