 Hating the Internal Revenue Service is an American pastime that transcends political affiliation This past May, disgust for the IRS reached an all-time high when Lois Lerner, director of the IRS's Exempt Organizations unit, disclosed the agency had improperly targeted social welfare organizations seeking special status under section 501(c 4) of the tax code based on their political ideology This revelation resulted in more than three months (and counting) of congressional hearings and investigations Read the IRS inspector general's report on targeting But in typical Washington fashion, the manufactured congressional outrage and grandstanding has served to do little more than obfuscate the real scandal at the IRS: that the agency allows social welfare organizations to manipulate federal tax law by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on political ads Anyone who watched television in the lead-up to the 2010 and 2012 elections undoubtedly noticed the slew of vitriolic, misleading campaign ads  Some of these ads were sponsored by federal candidates, but many more were produced by groups with innocuous sounding names such as Crossroads GPS or the American Action Network but massive bank accounts  Crossroads GPS, for example, a nonprofit organization cofounded by former George W  Bush administration official Karl Rove, spent more than $70 million on the 2012 election Like the groups targeted by the IRS, Crossroads GPS is a section 501(c 4) organization, which affords certain tax benefits and most importantly the ability to keep the names of donors secret  Federal law requires these groups to operate exclusively for purposes beneficial to the community as a whole What does that mean exactly? No one knows And that really is a scandal
