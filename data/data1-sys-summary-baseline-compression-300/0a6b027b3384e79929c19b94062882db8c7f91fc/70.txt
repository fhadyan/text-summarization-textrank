 Arsenal kept their slim hopes of winning this season's English Premier League title alive by beating relegation threatened Burnley 1-0 at Turf Moor A first half goal from Welsh international Aaron Ramsey was enough to separate the two sides and secure Arsenal's hold on second place More importantly it took the north London club to within four points of first placed Chelsea, with the two clubs to play next week But Chelsea have two games in hand and play lowly Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, a team who are themselves struggling against relegation Good form Arsenal have been in superb form since the start of the year, transforming what looked to be another mediocre season struggling to secure fourth place and with it Champions League qualification into one where they at least have a shot at winning the title
