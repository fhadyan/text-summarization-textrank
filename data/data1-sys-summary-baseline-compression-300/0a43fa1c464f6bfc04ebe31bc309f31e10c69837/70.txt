In 2012, photographer Matika Wilbur sold everything in her Seattle apartment and hit the road on a cross-country journey Her goal? To photograph individuals from each of the 562 federally recognized Native American tribes in the United States and memorialize their stories Since then, the number of federally recognized tribes has risen to 566, and Wilbur is still crisscrossing the country, immersing herself in the worlds of Native Americans from Brooklyn to the far reaches of Alaska for her ongoing photo series, Project 562  Stereotypes in the media reduce Indian country to the Plains Indian in a headdress, said scholar Adrienne Keene, a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma whom Wilbur photographed for the series  (Project 562) gives people an opportunity to see the diversity in Indian country and reframe what they think of when they think of Native Americans A selection of photos from Project 562 is on display at the Tacoma Art Museum in Washington through October 5, with audio from Wilbur's conversations with her subjects Fans of the series say its timing could not be better  With mainstream America showing more support for efforts to end appropriation of Native American imagery in sports and fashion, they say Project 562 provides positive examples to fill the void  Having these counter-narratives and counter-representations to the stereotypes and negative portrayals we see in the media every day is really important for helping people understand contemporary Native Americans, said Keene The project is also building relationships in Indian country, cultivating bonds among Wilbur, the participants and also connecting them to elite institutions like the Tacoma Art Museum, Keene said  What she's doing is not just photographing Native American designers fight cultural caricatures
