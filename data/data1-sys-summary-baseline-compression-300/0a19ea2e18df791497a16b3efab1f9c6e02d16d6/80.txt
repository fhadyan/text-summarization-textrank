 Egypt's revolution has made life tougher still for Cairo's 80,000 taxi drivers, struggling to make a living on the city's chaotic, congested and potholed streets, says the author who has written a best-selling book about them Khaled AlKhamissi's novel Taxi, first published in 2006, has been translated into 10 languages  It features 58 fictional monologues with taxi drivers recreated from his own experience  A new post-revolution English edition has just been published Despite the optimism that swept Egypt after president Hosni Mubarak was toppled in February, AlKhamissi said taxi drivers, and the rest of the country's poor, have in fact suffered more since then  My taxi drivers are among the 55% of the population living under the poverty line of $2 a day, said AlKhamissi  Those 55% were not on the streets during the revolution and are without a real voice now He added: Life has changed for them in the wrong direction
