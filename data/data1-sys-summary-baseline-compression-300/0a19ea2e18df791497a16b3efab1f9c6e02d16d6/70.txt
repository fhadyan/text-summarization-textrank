 Egypt's revolution has made life tougher still for Cairo's 80,000 taxi drivers, struggling to make a living on the city's chaotic, congested and potholed streets, says the author who has written a best-selling book about them Khaled AlKhamissi's novel Taxi, first published in 2006, has been translated into 10 languages  It features 58 fictional monologues with taxi drivers recreated from his own experience  A new post-revolution English edition has just been published Despite the optimism that swept Egypt after president Hosni Mubarak was toppled in February, AlKhamissi said taxi drivers, and the rest of the country's poor, have in fact suffered more since then  My taxi drivers are among the 55% of the population living under the poverty line of $2 a day, said AlKhamissi  Those 55% were not on the streets during the revolution and are without a real voice now  They are wise, they are watching, they are analyzing, but they are not acting He added: Life has changed for them in the wrong direction  It's worse for them because we have no security and living on the streets without security is dangerous  There is less tourism and more chaos on the streets AlKhamissi said it was too early to tell if life was improving for the middle classes who took to the streets during the revolution  But the author wants to get back to writing fiction  We invented popular literature
