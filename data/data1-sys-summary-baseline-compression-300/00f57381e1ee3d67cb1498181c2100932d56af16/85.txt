 A spate of deadly shootings during anti-drug operations in Honduras including two in which U  agents killed suspects is linked to an aggressive new strategy to disrupt a preferred corridor for traffickers Operation Anvil, as the multinational mission is known, differs from past efforts because of its reliance on military outposts close to the front lines to provide quick responses  It is a strategy reminiscent of counterinsurgency tactics used by the U  military on battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan In a two-month span, six people have been killed in the operation, including possibly four innocent civilians Despite the controversial shootings, American and Honduran officials say they both are happy with their collaboration and consider Operation Anvil launched in April a success As of Wednesday, authorities said, they had interdicted five planes, seized about 2,300 kilos of cocaine, and made seven arrests  Firearms, including military assault rifles, have also been seized  The amount of drugs seized and the disruption of narcotrafficking routes speak for themselves, said Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro, the Honduran ambassador to the United States Meanwhile, critics in Honduras and the United States oppose the law enforcement strategy and question why American agents are killing anyone on foreign soil during peacetime  The suspect later died It was the second such incident in a two-week span  The official asked not to be named because the a final report has not been issued
