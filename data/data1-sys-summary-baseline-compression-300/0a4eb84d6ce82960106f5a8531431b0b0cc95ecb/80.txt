 It's getting difficult, even for a defense attorney, to keep track of the allegations against Bill Cosby  Recently, the embattled comedian's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the actor-comedian of sexually assaulting plaintiff Judith Huth in 1974 at the Playboy Mansion when she was 15 Huth claims she and a 16-year-old friend met Cosby at a Los Angeles-area film shoot  A week later Cosby allegedly plied them with drinks at a tennis club, after which the lawsuit states that Cosby took her to the Playboy Mansion  At the mansion, Cosby allegedly forced her to perform a sex act on him Cosby and his attorneys are not going quietly into the good night  They have filed a demurrer , which challenges the legal sufficiency of the claims or the complaint itself  A demurrer essentially says the complaint is so defective as written, that it should be dismissed His attorneys have also gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit In the court of public opinion, many have already concluded that there is something to these mounting accusations In real court, however, the rules are different  Huth's attorneys should have complied with these rules
