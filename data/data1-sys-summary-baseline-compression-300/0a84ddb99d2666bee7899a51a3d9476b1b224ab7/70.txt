 It is a Sunday night in Bridgetown, Barbados Here on this Caribbean island, and on the others that make up what's known as the West Indies, life revolves around one thing cricket On this night, locals gather at historic Kensington Oval, which hosted the 2007 World Cup final  There are no national teams on display this time, but there is a local trophy up for grabs It's enough to draw a large crowd of boisterous fans  In the concourse, a familiar face makes his way through the crowd He is Franklyn Stephenson, and he is the best to have never played for the West Indies, all because of one decision he and his teammates made 30 years ago It left each of them forever branded a rebel In 1983, the West Indies cricket team was on top of the world  Team captain Clive Lloyd, from Guyana, had led them to back-to-back World Cup victories in 1975 and '79 Contact 'Branded a rebel' presenter Don Riddell on Facebook Overflowing with talent, the islands of the West Indies could have fielded at least two teams of world-class players  But with all the hype and success, money did not follow  Playing international and club cricket was not enough to earn a living At the same time, a world away, South Africa was deep in the heart of apartheid  Its government's policies had split life into different classifications for whites and so-called non-whites Such oppression against the non-white population intensified into violence, landing young protesters like Nelson Mandela in jail  Thousands more were arrested or killed As the world tried to pressure South Africa's leadership, sanctions were applied, and sport was no exception In 1970, the International Cricket Council banned South Africa from international competition, leaving the country's cricket-mad fans deprived of the sport they loved, and their cricketers of the careers they dreamed of  You're always optimistic, said former South African cricketer Clive Rice  The stupidity that existed would change and South Africa would change much quicker, and we'd be back playing international sport  But it hung on and hung on 'Rebel tours' To save cricket in South Africa, the sport's administrators knew something had to be done So, in secret, they began planning rebel tours inviting various teams from around the world It was a bold move to defy the ICC's ban by offering lucrative contracts  In March 1982, the first rebel team from England arrived in Johannesburg  From our point of view, we knew we had the best cricketers in the world, said former South African Cricket Union president Joe Pamensky, one of the rebel tour organizers  We wanted to show them off to the world so they would see it the same as we saw it Later that year, a team from Sri Lanka followed And it wasn't long before many began suspecting South Africa was also targeting a team from the West Indies, the dominant force in world cricket Mercenaries?
