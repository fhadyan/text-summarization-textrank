 It is a Sunday night in Bridgetown, Barbados Here on this Caribbean island, and on the others that make up what's known as the West Indies, life revolves around one thing cricket On this night, locals gather at historic Kensington Oval, which hosted the 2007 World Cup final  There are no national teams on display this time, but there is a local trophy up for grabs It's enough to draw a large crowd of boisterous fans  In the concourse, a familiar face makes his way through the crowd He is Franklyn Stephenson, and he is the best to have never played for the West Indies, all because of one decision he and his teammates made 30 years ago It left each of them forever branded a rebel In 1983, the West Indies cricket team was on top of the world  Team captain Clive Lloyd, from Guyana, had led them to back-to-back World Cup victories in 1975 and '79 Contact 'Branded a rebel' presenter Don Riddell on Facebook Overflowing with talent, the islands of the West Indies could have fielded at least two teams of world-class players  But with all the hype and success, money did not follow  Playing international and club cricket was not enough to earn a living At the same time, a world away, South Africa was deep in the heart of apartheid  Its government's policies had split life into different classifications for whites and so-called non-whites  Thousands more were arrested or killed 'Rebel tours'
