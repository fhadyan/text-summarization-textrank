 In less than a week, Turkey will hold its first direct presidential election, yet the mood about the country can hardly be described as electric This is strange given the usual excitement around elections in Turkey, the historic importance of this poll, and the exceptionally high level of socio-political tensions in recent years Besides the summer heat and the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, the relative lull might be explained by the widespread anticipation that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, candidate of the ruling AKP, will emerge triumphant from the ballot box, in either the first or the second round Erdogan understands power and pursues it like no other politician in Turkey's modern history He has a tightening grip over all key state institutions, save perhaps the Constitutional Court  He also has a deeply emotional relationship with his followers, who rally around their leader more passionately as he faces stiffer opposition to his increasingly personal rule This is how he has survived massive anti-government protests, a damaging feud with former Islamist allies and a high profile corruption scandal, an appallingly mismanaged industrial disaster and successive foreign policy debacles latest being the abduction of 49 Turkish diplomats and consulate workers in Mosul by ISIS militants, whose rise some critics attribute in part to the AKP government's open border policy for jihadis fighting in Syria all in the space of a year But the lull should not overshadow the critical importance of the election To be sure, an Erdogan victory would amount to no less than regime change for Turkey
