Washington In the most extensive reshaping of the Obama administration's national security team to date, the president will name Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta as his nominee to succeed Robert Gates as defense secretary, top U  officials said Wednesday  David Petraeus will be nominated to take over as CIA director, and Lt  John Allen will succeed Petraeus as head of the U S-led international military force in Afghanistan, a senior administration official told reporters  In addition, longtime diplomat Ryan Crocker will be nominated as the next U  ambassador to Afghanistan, the official said President Barack Obama will formally announce the changes on Thursday, according to the senior administration official  It is the biggest reshaping of Obama's national security team since he took office in January 2009 and reflects a longstanding plan by Gates to step aside this year More changes also are coming  Both Adm  Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and FBI Director Robert Mueller are not eligible for renomination for terms that expire this year Gates will resign effective June 30, assuming Panetta gets confirmed by Congress in time and is ready to start on July 1, according to an administration official and a congressional aide familiar with phone calls Gates was making to legislators and senior staff members Petraeus will remain in command in Afghanistan until Allen is ready to take over at the beginning of September, officials said, which could require an interim CIA director if Panetta moves to the defense secretary's office as planned on July 1 In addition, Petraeus will resign from the military once confirmed so that he serves as a civilian CIA director, officials said Initial reaction from Congress was positive, with key legislators on intelligence and security issues praising both Panetta and Petraeus as good choices  The sum total of these picks is that the president has chosen experienced people with unique capabilities to serve our nation at a dangerous time, said Republican Sen  Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  This team will provide the leadership to help make our nation safer  I could not be more pleased with these selections  I hope these nominees receive swift approval by the United States Senate Panetta, 72, took over at the CIA in February 2009  Central Command in July 2008
