 Emergency operators get lots of crazy calls, but few start like this Caller: Hello, I'm trapped in this plane and I called my job, but I'm in this plane Operator: You're where?  Caller: I'm inside a plane and I feel like it's up moving in the air  Flight 448 can you please tell somebody (to) stop it The frantic 911 call came just as the Alaska Airlines flight had taken off from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon  The caller was a ramp agent who fell asleep in the plane's cargo hold The pilot radioed air traffic control and said he would make an emergency landing  Other than being scared, the agent never was in any real danger
