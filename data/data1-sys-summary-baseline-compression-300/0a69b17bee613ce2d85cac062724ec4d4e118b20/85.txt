Kamberg, South Africa Sunlight sparkles through the drops of water that tumble off the edge of the cliff  Painted on the rock face behind the tiny waterfall are a pair of faded eland, the largest antelope in Africa  Behind them are two barely visible human figures  This is a sacred place, says Raphael Mnkhati, a guide from the Kamberg Rock Art Center  Water is important for all life, and it was important for the people who lived here
