Kamberg, South Africa Sunlight sparkles through the drops of water that tumble off the edge of the cliff  Painted on the rock face behind the tiny waterfall are a pair of faded eland, the largest antelope in Africa  Behind them are two barely visible human figures  This is a sacred place, says Raphael Mnkhati, a guide from the Kamberg Rock Art Center  Water is important for all life, and it was important for the people who lived here The tiny cave behind the waterfall is only one of thousands of such hidden, secret shelters in the Drakensberg-Ukahlamba Mountains of South Africa  They were the home of the Bushmen, the original inhabitants of this country, who fled to these mountains to escape other Africans moving down from the north of the continent and white settlers moving up from the Cape  The Bushmen were wiped out in the countless conflicts that resulted  It's hard to date these paintings, Raphael explains  We are all from the same origins
