Coral Gables, Florida Former President Bill Clinton on Saturday defended his family foundation's practice of taking money from foreign countries, arguing that while he doesn't agree with all of the policies of countries that contributed, he feels the foundation has done a lot more good than harm The Clinton Foundation admitted last month that a 2010 donation from the Algerian government was not properly approved under the guidelines the Obama administration put in place with the foundation when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009  Bill Clinton defended the donations as something that went to worthwhile projects  The UAE [United Arab Emirates] gave us money  Do we agree with everything they do? No  But they are helping us fight ISIS and they built a great university with NYU open to people around the world, Clinton said at a foundation event in Florida  Do I agree with all the foreign policy of Saudi Arabia? No Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman are among the countries that donated to the Clinton Foundation Clinton continued: You've got to decide when you do this work, whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country  I believe we have done a lot more good than harm The story became a controversy for the Clintons, one where even some Democrats questioned the practice
