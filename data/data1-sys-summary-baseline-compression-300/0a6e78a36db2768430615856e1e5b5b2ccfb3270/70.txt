 There is nothing terribly surprising in Apple's refreshed line of tablets, but that's OK We spent some time testing and touching the new iPad Mini and iPad Air after Tuesday's press conference  As promised by Apple executives, the new devices were lighter, thinner and seemingly faster just like many incremental product upgrades from the past iPad Air There were no major new features, such as the fingerprint scanner or camera upgrade that came with the iPhone 5S The most unexpected news of the day was a new name for the $499 fifth-generation iPad, which is now the iPad Air  The iPad line has been a bit wishy-washy with names It began by counting each version, but then dropped the number and asked only to be know as iPad, like Cher  The iPad 2 kept its number and a spot in stores, where its slightly lower price tag (now $399) might appeal to someone considering a cheaper Android or Windows tablet Physically, the iPad Air is indeed lighter and thinner than its predecessor  It's 20% thinner than the third generation iPad, measuring in at a slight  29-inch  An ad shown at the press conference showed an iPad Air lying flat on a tablet, hiding discretely behind a No  2 pencil  It has also dropped a bit of weight and the Wi-Fi version is now exactly 1 pound (the cellular version is 1 05 pounds  Unfortunately, I didn't have an older iPad on hand to do a weight comparison, and I'd picked up an iPad Mini first  Nothing makes a regular iPad feel hefty like holding an iPad Mini  You can't unfeel a Mini; it's just so delightfully wee 9-inch size
