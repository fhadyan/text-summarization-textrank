 Be bold! Think big! Barack Obama wants to do just that  An $800 billion economic stimulus plan  Three million jobs  Health care reform  A restructured automobile industry Obama's popularity with voters will win him influence with political opponents Obama won the biggest Democratic majority for president in 44 years  His party made big gains in Congress  Democrats now have a majority of nearly 60 percent in both the House and Senate  President Obama's got a mandate  And a majority  What's to stop him? Just this: the U  system of government  It is set up to make it difficult to get things done The Constitution was written 222 years ago by men who didn't trust government  They had just waged a revolution against a king  To the founders of the American republic, strong government meant despotism So they set up a system with an elaborate separation of powers  The idea was to ensure weak government The dirty little secret of American government is that it was designed not to work very well As president after president has discovered, there are innumerable ways opponents can stop measures from getting passed, even if the president's party holds a majority in Congress The Senate has its own rule that's not in the Constitution requiring a super-majority of 60 Senate votes to control the agenda A minority of 41 senators can filibuster a measure and prevent it from coming up for a vote
