Rand Paul wears his political ambition for all to see  Look no further than the tie he sported during a three-day trip to Iowa  It had yellow images of corn, the crop that epitomizes politics in the first-in-the-nation caucus state  And by coincidence, I have one in the shape of South Carolina, the Kentucky Republican said Wednesday, drawing laughs He was speaking at a Republican breakfast outside Des Moines at Machine Shed, a Midwest restaurant chain where the waiters wear overalls and drinks are served in Mason jars As Paul blitzed across the Hawkeye State this week, holding events at Iowa GOP offices and campaigning for local candidates, he hardly played coy to the question of whether he was running for President  After all, his nine-city trip marked his fourth visit to the state since the 2012 election  I don't know why Iowa keeps popping up on my calendar, but it seems to be pretty frequent, he said Monday, clearly with sarcasm His itinerary this time included a campaign-style schedule where he continued testing his 2016 message on the road From reducing the federal deficit to defending civil liberties and reforming the criminal justice system, Paul mostly stayed on his talking points But the trip was not without controversy His combative answer to a reporter's question combined with video of Paul appearing to avoid an immigration activist â€” absorbed most of the attention surrounding his visit Experts say it's unlikely those story lines will derail any progress Paul has made in the state with voters, but his comments could underscore questions some Republicans have about his foreign policy, especially as he seeks to broaden his appeal Off-message At his first stop on Monday, which actually took place in Omaha, Nebraska, near the Iowa state line, Paul held a news conference after touring a tech startup venue with Nebraska GOP Senate hopeful Ben Sasse Asked if he still supported phasing out foreign aid to Israel, Paul fired back at a reporter for mischaracterizing his position and staunchly denied that he had ever proposed such legislation But it's well-documented that he called for ending all foreign aid, including assistance to Israel, and sought support in Congress for his proposal in 2011 In Iowa, Paul stressed that he never introduced legislation that solely targeted Israel and argued that he strongly favors sending money to the country Still, he added, Israel will be better positioned in the long run without foreign assistance  Every country ultimately would be better off to be independent, he said on Tuesday 'Son of Ron'
