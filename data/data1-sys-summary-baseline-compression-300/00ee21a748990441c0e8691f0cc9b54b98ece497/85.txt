Rand Paul wears his political ambition for all to see  Look no further than the tie he sported during a three-day trip to Iowa  It had yellow images of corn, the crop that epitomizes politics in the first-in-the-nation caucus state  And by coincidence, I have one in the shape of South Carolina, the Kentucky Republican said Wednesday, drawing laughs He was speaking at a Republican breakfast outside Des Moines at Machine Shed, a Midwest restaurant chain where the waiters wear overalls and drinks are served in Mason jars As Paul blitzed across the Hawkeye State this week, holding events at Iowa GOP offices and campaigning for local candidates, he hardly played coy to the question of whether he was running for President  After all, his nine-city trip marked his fourth visit to the state since the 2012 election  I don't know why Iowa keeps popping up on my calendar, but it seems to be pretty frequent, he said Monday, clearly with sarcasm His itinerary this time included a campaign-style schedule where he continued testing his 2016 message on the road From reducing the federal deficit to defending civil liberties and reforming the criminal justice system, Paul mostly stayed on his talking points But the trip was not without controversy Off-message 'Son of Ron'
