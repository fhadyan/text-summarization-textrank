BEIJING, China When Jimmy Wales visited the headquarters of Hudong com last month, he had one question for its founder: is it possible for Wikipedia to be the number one online encyclopedia in China? Don't call me Jimmy: Pan Haidong, head of Hudong com, the largest Chinese encyclopedia website  Absolutely not, was the response of Pan Haidong, head of Hudong com, the world's largest Chinese encyclopedia website  Because there is Hudong here in China  Of course we are a copycat of Wikipedia but we have a lot of innovations, and we do a lot of work here in China so it is totally different actually, Pan told CNN It's been a year since China's government lifted its ban on the Chinese version of U S based Wikipedia yet it remains unclear whether Wikipedia has gained any share of the country's massive Internet readership Shortly after Wikipedia was launched in China in 2002, the country's Internet censors began to intermittently block access to both Chinese and English versions of the online encyclopedia with the longest ban lasting around three years In recent months, Wales has held a series of meetings with officials from the State Council Information Office, the government body charged with internet censorship in China, to establish a dialogue between the Wikipedia community and Chinese government He says they have not discussed why the website was banned  We have a friendly relationship, Wales told CNN  It is not really a big concern  1 search engine in China
