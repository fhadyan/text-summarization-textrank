 The historic measure to regulate and tax marijuana in Washington State deserves to be looked at closely as a model of how legalization ought to be designed and implemented elsewhere in America We've turned a significant corner with the approval of Initiative 502, which purposefully offers a true public health alternative to the criminal prohibition of pot For the first time in a very long time, the well-intended but failed criminal penalties to protect public health and safety will be set aside  Adults who choose to use marijuana and obtain it through legal outlets will no longer be faced with the threat of criminal sanctions  People of color will no longer face the egregious inequities in how marijuana criminal penalties are imposed  Parents, as they help prepare their children for the choices they face concerning marijuana, will no longer be hobbled by misinformation about the drug and the absence of effective supports to encourage abstinence  Roffman
