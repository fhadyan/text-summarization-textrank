 Marco Rubio is all in  The Republican senator from Florida has announced that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the American Dream With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016  Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations  He holds little appeal to Latino voters  And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep Back in 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate Gang of 8 that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants  He later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from House Republicans, and now says he favors a piecemeal approach, starting with securing the border His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates  That's a shame, for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to Latino voters Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration  He believes that President Obama's Deferred Action program, offering deportation relief to young immigrants, should be ended
