New York Planned Parenthood of New York City blasted the city's new Teen Pregnancy Prevention Campaign on Thursday, saying it won't deter teen pregnancy and inappropriately shames and stigmatizes its target audience The campaign creates stigma, hostility and negative public opinions about teen pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering alternative aspirations for young people, said Haydee Morales, the organization's vice president of education and training  The city's money would be better spent helping teens access health care, birth control and high-quality sexual and reproductive health education, not on an ad campaign intended to create shock value The New York City Human Resources Administration/Department of Social Services announced the $400,000 initiative, which features pictures of babies delivering messages to their hypothetical parents such as Honestly, mom chances are he won't stay with you  What happens to me? The small print adds that 90% of teen parents don't marry each other  Dad, you'll be paying to support me for the next 20 years, says another of the ads, which adds in smaller print that NY State law requires a parent to pay child support until a child is 21  Got a good job? I cost thousands of dollars each year, says another, which adds that teen parents should expect to spend more than $10,000 a year to raise their child
