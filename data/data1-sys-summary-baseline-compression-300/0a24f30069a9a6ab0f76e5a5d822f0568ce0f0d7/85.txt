The December gang-rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi has stirred consciences in India in a way I have never before experienced: It has forced Indians to confront a terrible truth that for our girls and women, violence and discrimination are facts of daily life, an epidemic that, researchers say, claims nearly 2 million lives in India each year But now the real work begins for each of us who took to the streets in protest  How do we channel the energy of those demonstrations into real solutions for our communities? I was disappointed to see they had invited only the heads of girls' schools The fact is most people want what is best for their loved ones  This was all necessary
