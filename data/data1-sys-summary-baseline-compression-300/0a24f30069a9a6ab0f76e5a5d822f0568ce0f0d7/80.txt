The December gang-rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi has stirred consciences in India in a way I have never before experienced: It has forced Indians to confront a terrible truth that for our girls and women, violence and discrimination are facts of daily life, an epidemic that, researchers say, claims nearly 2 million lives in India each year But now the real work begins for each of us who took to the streets in protest  How do we channel the energy of those demonstrations into real solutions for our communities? I got a taste of the challenge earlier this month, when officials from the Barabanki district in Uttar Pradesh, a state adjoining New Delhi, asked if I would lead a workshop promoting teen safety and gender sensitivity for the government schools I was disappointed to see they had invited only the heads of girls' schools  I've seen how the deep inequalities between women and men trap millions of Indian families in cycle of poverty
