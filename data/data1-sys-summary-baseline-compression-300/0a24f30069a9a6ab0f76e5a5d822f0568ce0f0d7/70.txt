The December gang-rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi has stirred consciences in India in a way I have never before experienced: It has forced Indians to confront a terrible truth that for our girls and women, violence and discrimination are facts of daily life, an epidemic that, researchers say, claims nearly 2 million lives in India each year But now the real work begins for each of us who took to the streets in protest  How do we channel the energy of those demonstrations into real solutions for our communities? I got a taste of the challenge earlier this month, when officials from the Barabanki district in Uttar Pradesh, a state adjoining New Delhi, asked if I would lead a workshop promoting teen safety and gender sensitivity for the government schools I was disappointed to see they had invited only the heads of girls' schools  And so I accepted under one condition: that the principals of the district's boys' schools attend as well  Because if there's one thing I'm certain of it's that all the candlelight vigils, passion and protests will be in vain if we don't figure out how to make men and boys part of this growing movement to transform gender relations in my country For more than a decade I've worked for the poverty-fighting group CARE as a community educator on health and gender issues The fact is most people want what is best for their loved ones  This was all necessary
