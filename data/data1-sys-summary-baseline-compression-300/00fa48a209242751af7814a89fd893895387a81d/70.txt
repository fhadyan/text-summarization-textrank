London, England Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup Television cameras showed Henry guiding the ball with his hand twice, before William Gallas scored from his resulting cross to give Les Bleus a narrow win in the two-legged World Cup play-off against the Republic of Ireland  I will be honest  It was a handball but I am not the referee, the Barcelona striker told reporters after the match in Paris The Irish Justice Ministry confirmed to CNN that Dermot Ahern had asked the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to demand a replay in the interests of fair play  Thierry Henry has admitted handling the ball, claims he told the ref he handled it  Millions of people worldwide saw it was a blatant double handball not to mention a double offside and we should put the powers that be in the cozy world of FIFA on the spot and demand a replay, Ahern said in a statement sent to CNN  They probably won't grant it as we are minnows in world football but let's put them on the spot  It's the least we owe the thousands of devastated young fans around the country  Otherwise if that result remains it reinforces the view that if you cheat you will win The FAI later confirmed that it had taken the matter to FIFA  I really believe the integrity of the game has been questioned last night, chief executive John Delaney told reporters  The governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay Delaney said the FAI had also written to the French football federation  They need to look at themselves in this situation  It is up to the people who govern the game now  Every time I go to a FIFA congress I hear about fair play and integrity  FIFA will probably be happy  We're devastated
