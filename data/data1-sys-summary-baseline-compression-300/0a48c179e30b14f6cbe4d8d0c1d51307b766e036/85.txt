SEOUL, South Korea The last bit of news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells into the sea near the border with South Korea Disturbing news from North Korea comes just as often as stories that make us laugh in disbelief  The many quirky, mystifying, baffling developments in Pyongyang make its young ruler, Kim Jung Un, an irresistible target for comedians It was hard to suppress a laugh, for example, when North Korea severely declared that an upcoming satirical Hollywood movie constituted an act of war and filed an official complaint with the United Nations Those are two sides of North Korea deliberately frightening and inadvertently comical  But Pyongyang has launched deadly attacks
