SEOUL, South Korea The last bit of news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells into the sea near the border with South Korea Disturbing news from North Korea comes just as often as stories that make us laugh in disbelief  The many quirky, mystifying, baffling developments in Pyongyang make its young ruler, Kim Jung Un, an irresistible target for comedians It was hard to suppress a laugh, for example, when North Korea severely declared that an upcoming satirical Hollywood movie constituted an act of war and filed an official complaint with the United Nations Those are two sides of North Korea deliberately frightening and inadvertently comical  Then there's a third side the part that makes us gasp in horror A yearlong investigation conducted by the United Nations found that North Korea is a country whose depth of brutality does not have any parallel in the contemporary world According to the report, North Korea engages in murder, torture, slavery and mass starvation to terrorize the population into submission  Stories from refugees who have escaped from North Korea are a chilling reminder that the regime is not just a military threat, it is causing a terrible humanitarian crisis North Korea is a Riddle Kingdom that is simultaneously threatening, bizarre and brutal  The regime's unpredictability is one of the factors that allow a small, impoverished state, unable to feed its own people, to stand toe to toe with much more powerful rivals
