 For Kei Nishikori, Project 45 has transformed into Project 10 The former was the 23-year-old's mission to topple the highest tennis ranking ever held by a Japanese male, Shuzo Matsuoka, who hit world No  46 back in July 1992 Nishikori smashed through that particular barrier towards the end of 2011 and has enjoyed a formidable few years on Tour, beating the likes of Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer Japan's rising son now sits in the lofty position of world No  11 his highest ever ranking and is tantalizingly poised to gatecrash the top 10 But with success comes expectation This surge towards the game's pinnacle has elevated Nishikori to rock star-like status in his home country, its population clamoring for their first ever grand slam champion  I try not to think too much because if I start thinking then I feel pressure myself, Nishikori told CNN's Human to Hero series  I think people have started thinking about me winning a grand slam or getting to the top ten but it might take some time  Hopefully I can do it someday
