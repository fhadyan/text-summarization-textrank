March 14 is my favorite day to be a nerd Across the country, math geeks in museums, schools, private groups and elsewhere gather to celebrate the number pi, approximately 3  That's why March 14 3-14 is Pi Day  What's more, Albert Einstein was born on this day A quick refresher: Pi is defined as the distance around a perfect circle, or the circumference, divided by the distance across it, or the diameter  It is also involved in calculating the area of a circle, the volume of a sphere, and many other mathematical formulas you might need in the sciences Throughout history, people have been captivated by this number because there is no way to calculate it exactly by a simple division on your calculator  What's more, its digits go on infinitely, without any pattern in the numbers 1415926535897932 etc  Even that many digits are more than most people would need for everyday use, but some folks have been inspired to memorize thousands of digits of pi, or even use the digits to create poetry or music On Pi Day, one number 'reeks of mystery' Math may be scary, but pi is not as evidenced by the widespread revelry on Pi Day  One might even say gasp! it's cool to like pi these days  Even the House of Representatives supported the designation of March 14 as National Pi Day in 2009 In countries where the day is written before the month, Friday is 14-3, which looks less like pi  And so Pi Day is an acquired taste, mathematician Jonathan Borwein, at the University of Newcastle in Australia, said in an e-mail Conveniently, pi sounds like pie, and pies are round  You could celebrate Pi Day in a casual way by grabbing a slice of pastry, or pizza  If you're in enrolled in school, your math class or math department might be doing something special already But if you happen to live in a particularly pi-happy place, you might be able to take part in some larger-scale, pi-inspired activities Where Pi Day began  Last year was Pi Day's 25th anniversary there Where Einstein lived  Philly
