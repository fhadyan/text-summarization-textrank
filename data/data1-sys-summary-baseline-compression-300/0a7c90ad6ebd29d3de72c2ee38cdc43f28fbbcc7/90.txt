His friends used to call him Hoss, as in Hoss Cartwright from the TV show Bonanza  At 6'2 and roughly 380 pounds, Mark Rucker once resembled the big, friendly character Now, they call him The Beast The nickname is apt  Since February 2011, Rucker has run his first 5K, his first 10K, his first half-marathon and his first marathon  He's completed an Olympic-distance triathlon and lost more than 100 pounds  And on August 26, he'll participate in his first full-length Ironman competition in Louisville, Kentucky Like they say, he's a beast  What he does after this Ironman, I don't know, his wife, Annita Rucker, said with a laugh  That was not good Her transformation was his inspiration
