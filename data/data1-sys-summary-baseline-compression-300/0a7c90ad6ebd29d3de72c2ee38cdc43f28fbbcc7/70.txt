His friends used to call him Hoss, as in Hoss Cartwright from the TV show Bonanza  At 6'2 and roughly 380 pounds, Mark Rucker once resembled the big, friendly character Now, they call him The Beast The nickname is apt  Since February 2011, Rucker has run his first 5K, his first 10K, his first half-marathon and his first marathon  He's completed an Olympic-distance triathlon and lost more than 100 pounds  And on August 26, he'll participate in his first full-length Ironman competition in Louisville, Kentucky Like they say, he's a beast  What he does after this Ironman, I don't know, his wife, Annita Rucker, said with a laugh  I hope he can find something to focus all this energy on From Rucker's DailyMile blog: April 18, 2011 First day of the Couch to 5K program  That was not good  But at least I did the whole workout (1 98 miles/ 32 minutes/ 16:10 pace) Change is a funny thing, Rucker says  Often, the desire to change grows over time  A series of events leads to an a ha moment, when desire must meet with the proper tools and the right inspiration In the summer of 2010, Rucker, of Lexington, Kentucky, and his family went to Dollywood in Tennessee  His daughter was 11 at the time, a little daredevil, and wanted to ride all the roller coasters  Unfortunately, Rucker couldn't fit on any of them with her  She was devastated; I was crushed, Rucker said  But even that wasn't enough to get me started on the journey  I guess I just didn't know how to do it Does parenting make us fat? In January 2011, he reconnected with an old elementary school friend, Anita Mills, and the two began talking on Facebook, discussing Mills' 240-pound weight loss Her transformation was his inspiration  But he still wasn't ready to change After weighing in at about 365 pounds, he stopped stepping on the scale  He was diagnosed with sleep apnea and put on medication for high blood pressure  He feared that he was diabetic but wouldn't visit his doctor The day after the 2011 Super Bowl, Rucker woke up in pain
