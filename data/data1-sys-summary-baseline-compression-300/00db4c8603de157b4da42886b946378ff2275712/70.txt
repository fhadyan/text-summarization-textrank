 In September 1985 a devastating earthquake measuring 8 1 on the Richter Scale smashed into Mexico City killing 10,000 people and leaving parts of the city in ruins Since then, the populous Latin American nation of 122 million has invested in one of the most advanced seismic warning systems anywhere in the world The SASMEX facility came online in 1991 and reacts to data gathered by sensors placed near major fault lines along Mexico's Pacific coast Receivers dotted around five major cities, including Mexico City and Acapulco, will sound the alarm if they detect an earthquake It's a system that can buy vital seconds for residents to brace themselves before the tremors begin But not everyone has access to a SASMEX receiver there are 100,000 in operation but at a cost of roughly $330 apiece, they are a luxury the majority of Mexicans can't afford Most receivers are stationed in the likes of public buildings, hospitals, schools and subway stations With roughly 21 million people living both formally and informally in and around Mexico City alone, that means many will not be aware the alarm is sounding until the ground begins shaking $50 alarm According to local tech entrepreneur, Andres Meira, such vital services should be far more widely available Meira is no passive observer in this debate  He moved to Mexico City after working in Haiti and witnessing the devastation caused by the 7 0 magnitude earthquake that struck the Caribbean island in 2010 killing more than 230,000 people It's an experience that had a profound and lasting effect on him  Until you live in one of these places you don't really understand the primitive fear of earthquakes, he said It's called the Grillo (the Spanish word for cricket) early warning system
