Editor's note: The staff at CNN com has been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York  The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process  We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN com readers Brooklyn, New York (VICE COM) The first time I went to Libya, in 2010, I was arrested just two days into my trip  Filming a documentary for VICE, I was detained for shooting where the authorities thought I shouldn't, beginning endless rounds of questions, emphatic yelling and head-shaking incredulity at my claims of innocence and, of course, the requisite implications that I was a spy  When I was finally released, I swore I would never return to the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya
