 So many visitors to Turkey see little more than the beautiful but crowded Mediterranean coast or the great mosques and palaces of Istanbul But the country is huge, and there are many more attractions away from the tourist hotspots Relics of vanished civilizations, a vast inland sea with a water-loving cat and a Biblical mountain with views deep into Iran and Armenia are just some of the reasons to go  See it all from a train For people who like intrepid journeys but like them even more when they're sitting or lying down, the Turkish rail system is heaven From February 2014, if all goes to plan, you'll be able to whiz between Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey's capital, on a new high speed train East of Ankara the pace slows The Dogu Expresi (Eastern Express) leaves nightly at 6 p  and takes just more than 24 hours to trundle from Ankara to Kars, almost 1,500 kilometers away in the remote northeast It stops at the cities of Kayseri, Sivas and Erzurum, passes through the rolling fields of Anatolia and ends among snow-topped eastern mountains The two-berth cabins have a mini-fridge stocked with mineral water and soft drinks, and washbasins with hot and cold running water A porter makes your bed and brings drinks and snacks during the day, and there's a dining car You can book online at Turkish State Railways, or by phone 90 0216 337 8724 but the English version of the site is clunky it's easier to book through a travel agent or buy tickets at a station Tickets cost $45 in a one-berth cabin on the Ankara-Kars route  Hunt rare ruins It sometimes feels that you can't walk more than a few paces in Turkey without stubbing your toe on some millennia-old relic Some sites such as ever-popular Ephesus are packed with visitors almost all year round But remarkably few people visit the equally spectacular Aphrodisias, where you can wander around a square kilometer of ruined temples and theaters with only tortoises for company The site reached its zenith around 2,000 years ago, when it was famed for its sculptors You can see some of their work in the excellent on-site museum Aphrodisias is around 160 kilometers from the coastal resorts of Bodrum, Marmaris or Kusadasi  The easiest way to get there is by car, and car rental is available at all resorts and at Dalaman Airport  Cycle among mountains
