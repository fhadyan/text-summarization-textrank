 Ferguson is crumbling  The cowardly and reprehensible shooting Wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the Missouri town, which had already seen Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announce his resignation after a damning Justice Department report on its police department The report, which was ordered in the wake of the killing of Michael Brown last year, highlighted a predatory policing problem and a department that was biased, prejudiced and that has regularly targeted, arrested and fined African-Americans Residents understandably want justice  But what's worse in all this is that Ferguson is illustrative of a broader problem across the country as increasingly militarized majority-white police departments demonstrate consistent racial bias toward majority-black communities It's a combustible mix In three-quarters of all U  cities with populations 50,000 or more, the police presence is disproportionately white relative to the local population, according to The Washington Post  And tensions are being exacerbated by the use among police departments of military weapons, and stipulations that these former war zone weapons must be used within a year of acquisition All this suggests a need for a completely new mindset on how we try to understand and implement policing practices across America  It's that simple  In fact, the opposite happens
