 Egypt's revolution has made life tougher still for Cairo's 80,000 taxi drivers, struggling to make a living on the city's chaotic, congested and potholed streets, says the author who has written a best-selling book about them.
 AlKhamissi, whose second novel Noah's Ark also a bestseller was published in 2009, said he stopped writing his third novel at the start of the uprising on January 25 this year and has been unable to concentrate on writing since.
 He said: Some journalists have said that about my book, but it's nonsense to say that one book or 10 books can change reading habits.
  They don't have time to read because they are struggling to survive, he said.
