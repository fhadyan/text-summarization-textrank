 When Idi Amin told every Asian to leave, they all left the country and went mainly to the UK, Barungi continued, adding that he believes this when Uganda began to economically fall apart.
  Within a few years Kakira Sugar Industries had collapsed, but so had infrastructure in Uganda.
 Kakira has built schools and hospitals to cater for their staff and their families while the company has also founded the Kakira Outgrowers Rural Development Fund (KORD an NGO that provides the likes of workshops, loans and other services for its contractors.
 Besides nearly 8,000 staff members, Kakira has almost as many contract workers in the shape of farmers, like Mwanja Banuli.
  To be able to sustain business you want agricultural farmers, plantation workers, you want factory workers and the vision of Muljibhai Mudhvani was to develop human resources, Barungi said.
