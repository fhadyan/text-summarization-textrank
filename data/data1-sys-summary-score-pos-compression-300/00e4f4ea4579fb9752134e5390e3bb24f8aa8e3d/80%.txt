 What you see in the background is the first mill that was installed in 1930 to crush only 150 tons of cane, explains Kenneth Barungi, assistant general manager of Kakira at the site of the company's nearby factory.
  (Kakira) started expanding every 10 years, every 20 years, modernizing, acquiring more land, introducing irrigation, expanding the crushing capacity.
 Dawn of dictatorship.
  When Idi Amin told every Asian to leave, they all left the country and went mainly to the UK, Barungi continued, adding that he believes this when Uganda began to economically fall apart.
  Within a few years Kakira Sugar Industries had collapsed, but so had infrastructure in Uganda.
 Kakira has built schools and hospitals to cater for their staff and their families while the company has also founded the Kakira Outgrowers Rural Development Fund (KORD an NGO that provides the likes of workshops, loans and other services for its contractors.
  To be able to sustain business you want agricultural farmers, plantation workers, you want factory workers and the vision of Muljibhai Mudhvani was to develop human resources, Barungi said.
