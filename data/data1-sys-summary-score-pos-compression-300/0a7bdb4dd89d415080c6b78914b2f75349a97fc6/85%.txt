 This campaign is part of the city's comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention program, which includes sex education, increased access to birth control and partnerships with community-based organizations, said Samantha Levine, deputy press secretary for Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
 Planned Parenthood said that it supports the initiatives and recognizes the importance of awareness and education, but added that the rate of teen pregnancies is affected by economic and societal factors such as poverty, violence, limited access to health care, as well as gender, racial and ethnic inequalities.
  Teens giving birth before they are ready to provide emotional and financial support is not a good way to raise children, said Administration Commissioner Robert Doar.
