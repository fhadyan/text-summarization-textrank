 In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, the Sudanese government waited until the mother weaned her child before executing any sentence, said Christian Solidarity Worldwide spokeswoman Kiri Kankhwende.
  The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered, said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher.
 Katherine Perks with the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies said the verdict goes against Sudan's own constitution and commitments made under regional and international law.
