Closer ties between Taiwan and the mainland, observers say, have brought significant peace dividends to both sides robust business and trade, tourism, academic and people-to-people exchanges and family reunions.
 Mainland companies, on the other hand, invested U.S 174 million into over 200 projects in Taiwan in the short time since Taiwan allowed mainland investments in June 2009, Xinhua said.
 Since Taiwan opened its borders to mainland tourists three-and-a-half years ago, says Shao Qiwei, head of China's tourism agency, over three million mainlanders have visited the island.
