Jia Qingling, a top communist party official who oversees Taiwan affairs, recently warned: If we deny the status quo there is no way to carry on any further negotiations, and what we have achieved so far would be in vain.
 Closer ties between Taiwan and the mainland, observers say, have brought significant peace dividends to both sides robust business and trade, tourism, academic and people-to-people exchanges and family reunions.
 Mainland companies, on the other hand, invested U.S 174 million into over 200 projects in Taiwan in the short time since Taiwan allowed mainland investments in June 2009, Xinhua said.
 Since Taiwan opened its borders to mainland tourists three-and-a-half years ago, says Shao Qiwei, head of China's tourism agency, over three million mainlanders have visited the island.
 Despite the ambiguity, the 1992 Consensus has served as the basis for cross-strait dialogue that has led in recent years to the unprecedented blossoming of economic and people-to-people ties across the Taiwan Strait.
 Beijing says it prefers to do so peacefully but refuses to rule out the use of force to keep Taiwan from declaring itself a separate state.
