 South African fashion artist Steve Mandy agrees.
 Looking ahead, Ademiluyi says the goal is to hold the event twice a year and also establish a supply platform that would make the designers' creations more accessible to the world.
 Mixing current trends with traditional patterns, more than 60 designers graced the catwalk with a wide array of colorful creations everything from show-stopping evening gowns and modern urban casualwear to bold textured prints and chic accessory lines.
