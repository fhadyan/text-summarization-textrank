Martin van Vliet, a researcher at the African Studies Center in Leiden, the Netherlands, said that while Timbuktu was no longer a city of vital economic or military importance, it stood out as an important prize for the rebels due to its symbolic significance.
 The city, today part of present-day Mali and known as the city of 333 saints for the Sufi imams, sheiks and scholars buried there, was made a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988..
  Timbuktu in the 14th to the 16th century was an important university city where many manuscripts referring to knowledge of astronomy, economy, religion, mathematics, physics, and medicine were produced, said Lazare Eloundou, chief of the Africa unit for UNESCO's World Heritage Center.
 Comprising the other significant component of Timbuktu's heritage legacy, this immense trove of scholarly manuscripts estimated to number in the hundreds of thousands remains in the city in state and private collections.
