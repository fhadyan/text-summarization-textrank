The problem is that even while public opinion has reached an all-time high on marriage equality, old laws discriminating against gay and lesbian Americans have stayed on the books, hurting gay couples and their families.
 The court found DOMA to be unconstitutional and it also allowed marriage rights for same-sex couples to return to California.
 Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy ruled that restricting marriage to opposite-gender couples forces same-sex couples to live as married for the purpose of state law but unmarried for the purpose of federal law, thus diminishing the stability and predictability of basic personal relations the state has found it proper to acknowledge and protect.
 Marriage is an institution that provides stability for society and for the family.
