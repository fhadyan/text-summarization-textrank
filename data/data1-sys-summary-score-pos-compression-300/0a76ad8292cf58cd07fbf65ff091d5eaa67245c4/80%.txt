 A man suspected in the deaths of three people in Panama is now wanted in the slaying of an American woman whose body was found last week, Panama's national police said Saturday.
 Dwayne Cooney, a family friend, said Hughes had lived in Panama for the past decade and owned a hotel, the Casa del Sapo, in Boca del Torro.
