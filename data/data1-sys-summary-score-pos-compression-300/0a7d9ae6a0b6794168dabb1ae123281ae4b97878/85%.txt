 Delta Air Lines said it also offers passengers with children an opportunity to preboard, including those with first class and business class tickets.
  There are very few things a parent can count on when it comes to air travel these days, but one of those things was always the ability to board first to get your children settled in and all of their needs met before the throngs of people board the plane, said Hanni in an e-mail to CNN. I hope United changes their mind.
