Most air ambulance pilots have a military background like the Duke, who joined a squadron based at RAF Valley after qualifying as a search and rescue pilot in 2010. He undertook 156 search and rescue operations, resulting in 149 people being rescued.
  He is highly skilled.
 Andrew Egerton Smith, chairman of the East Anglian Air Ambulance said: Having the Duke of Cambridge as one of our pilots is marvelous news as he brings much experience to the charity after his successful career as a search and rescue pilot.
 The palace said the pilot role would be the Duke's primary occupation.
