Cosby breaks his silence.
 First, when asserting claims based on alleged childhood sexual abuse, a plaintiff over the age of 26 has to file Certificates of Merit, documents executed by a licensed mental health practitioner attesting that the allegations have merit.
  A week later Cosby allegedly plied them with drinks at a tennis club, after which the lawsuit states that Cosby took her to the Playboy Mansion.
  Even if Huth is allowed to file these certificates, what medical professional will certify her lost memory until three years ago of an event that she tried to profit from by selling word of it some years before that?.
  Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission.
  A demurrer essentially says the complaint is so defective as written, that it should be dismissed His attorneys have also gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit.
