Cosby breaks his silence.
  Under California law, the only way that an alleged victim of childhood sexual abuse is able to bring an otherwise time-barred claim is to allege that the psychological injury was repressed and was only discovered within the last three years.
 First, when asserting claims based on alleged childhood sexual abuse, a plaintiff over the age of 26 has to file Certificates of Merit, documents executed by a licensed mental health practitioner attesting that the allegations have merit.
  A week later Cosby allegedly plied them with drinks at a tennis club, after which the lawsuit states that Cosby took her to the Playboy Mansion.
 Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit.
  Even if Huth is allowed to file these certificates, what medical professional will certify her lost memory until three years ago of an event that she tried to profit from by selling word of it some years before that?.
  A demurrer essentially says the complaint is so defective as written, that it should be dismissed His attorneys have also gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit.
