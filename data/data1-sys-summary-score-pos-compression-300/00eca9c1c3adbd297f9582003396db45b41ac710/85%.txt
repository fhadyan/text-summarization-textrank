Hamilton's time of one minute, 38.673 seconds in the second session in Yeongam was about one-tenth of a second quicker than Vettel, the triple reigning world champion who has captured the last two races in Korea.
  I love this track.
 The only driver with half-a-chance of catching Vettel, Fernando Alonso, was a distant seventh in the second session.
