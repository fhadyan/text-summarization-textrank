 It's not in Sydney's interests to see this area develop the attraction for Sydney people to come here is our lack of development.
 However, Randal Walker, chairman of Blue Mountains Tourism, argued that it is possible to develop sustainable tourism without damaging the natural beauty that visitors come to see.
  Although it looks gorgeous and beautiful it is a park under pressure there are a lot of vulnerable species in this national park, said Tara Cameron, a local teacher and President of Blue Mountains Conservation Society.
 Mark Jarvis, who runs a hotel in Katoomba, the main tourist town in the Blue Mountains, just an hour and a half from Sydney, said: We're very concerned because the uniqueness of area revolves around the fact that we sit in between World Heritage parks.
