One-time basketball bad boy Ron Artest, who changed his name to Metta World Peace and said it was meaningful and inspirational, was ejected Sunday from the Los Angeles Lakers-Oklahoma City Thunder game for hitting James Harden in the head with his elbow.
 World Peace's act was called disgraceful by game commentators, and sports analysts said the behavior was reminiscent of the ball player they once knew as Ron Artest.
 Sports fans were baffled, some even amused, when World Peace announced last year that he planned to legally change his name from Ron Artest.
  Ron Artest has contemplated the name change for years and always knew that he wanted his last name to be World Peace.
