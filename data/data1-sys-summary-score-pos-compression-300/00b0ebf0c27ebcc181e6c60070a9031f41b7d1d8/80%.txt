In recent months, Wales has held a series of meetings with officials from the State Council Information Office, the government body charged with internet censorship in China, to establish a dialogue between the Wikipedia community and Chinese government.
 What is a big concern for Wales is whether Wikipedia can compete with the country's two homegrown encyclopedia websites that emerged while Wikipedia was blocked: Hudong.
  I think I am going to have to come to China a lot and do interviews so people can learn about Wikipedia, said Wales.
 Hudong.
  Nearly 100 million Chinese netizens regularly visit online bulletin boards, according to research from China Internet Network Information Center.
 Since Hudong's and Baidu Baike's business operations are based in China, the companies have little choice but to comply with government policy or face the same fate as Wikipedia.
  I don't think they can become a reference book like Wikipedia because they don't have a serious community focusing on improving the quality of content as well as trying to respect neutral point of view, said Isaac Mao, a Chinese Wikipedian and blogger.
 It's been a year since China's government lifted its ban on the Chinese version of U.S based Wikipedia yet it remains unclear whether Wikipedia has gained any share of the country's massive Internet readership.
 Shortly after Wikipedia was launched in China in 2002, the country's Internet censors began to intermittently block access to both Chinese and English versions of the online encyclopedia with the longest ban lasting around three years.
