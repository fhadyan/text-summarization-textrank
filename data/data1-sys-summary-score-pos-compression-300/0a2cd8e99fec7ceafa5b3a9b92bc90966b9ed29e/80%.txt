 As a psychiatrist, former university president and advocate for Arab women in science, Rafia Ghubash is one of the United Arab Emirates' most influential women.
 Ghubash said her grandmothers' generation contributed far more to the politics, economy, education and literature of the region than has been recognized.
 The museum, Bait al Banaat, or House of Women, in Dubai was officially opened at the end of 2012 by Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, showcasing the contribution of women to the country's history.
  Women here were empowered a long time ago, but haven't had a chance to tell our story, said Ghubash.
