New Orleans, Louisiana Chemical dispersants keep flowing into the Gulf of Mexico at virtually unchanged levels despite the Environmental Protection Agency's order to BP to significantly scale back, according to a CNN analysis of daily dispersant reports provided by the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command.
 Before May 26, BP used 25,689 gallons a day of the chemical dispersant Corexit.
  Since then, CNN's analysis shows, the daily average of dispersant use has dropped to 23,250 gallons a day, a 9 percent decline.
