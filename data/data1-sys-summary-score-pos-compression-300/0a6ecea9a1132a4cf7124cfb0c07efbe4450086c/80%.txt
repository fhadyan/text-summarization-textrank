New Orleans, Louisiana Chemical dispersants keep flowing into the Gulf of Mexico at virtually unchanged levels despite the Environmental Protection Agency's order to BP to significantly scale back, according to a CNN analysis of daily dispersant reports provided by the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command.
  The EPA and Coast Guard say they're trying to keep dispersant use to around 18,000 barrels a day.
 Public statements at the time made by the EPA administrator gave the impression that federal officials were trying to cut down overall dispersant use.
  Since then, CNN's analysis shows, the daily average of dispersant use has dropped to 23,250 gallons a day, a 9 percent decline.
