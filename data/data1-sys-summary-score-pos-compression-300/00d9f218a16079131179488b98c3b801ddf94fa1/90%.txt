 They were launched in North Korea from three locations, South Korea's defense ministry said: Near the Kaesong area, 27 kilometers southeast of Haeju and 17 kilometers from Pyonggak.
 Kim said Seoul will send a warning via the United Nations to Pyongyang and tighten air defenses as a response to the drones.
