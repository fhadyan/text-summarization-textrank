 Scores of people who had been without bread for days were killed when Syrian warplanes bombed a bakery in the western village of Halfaya, opposition activists said Sunday.
 About an hour after the bakery attack, 15 shells were fired into Halfaya from a nearby town, Al-Rajb said.
 The Hama Revolution Command Council, a network of activists affiliated with the FSA in Hama province, said a MiG warplane bombed the bakery.
