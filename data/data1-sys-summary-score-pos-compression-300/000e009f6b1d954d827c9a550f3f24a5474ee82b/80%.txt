 Kyle White now has two pieces of metal to wear one, a bracelet inscribed with the names of his six comrades killed in an ambush in Afghanistan, the other, a Medal of Honor given to him for his valor that ensured that death toll wasn't higher.
 White himself insisted that the Medal of Honor cannot really be an individual award, calling it a testament to the trust we have in each other and our leaders.
 In an interview prior to the award ceremony, White told CNN how the group walked down this little incline and looking into the valley, (when) I hear this single shot.
 The former Army sergeant said Tuesday he owes it to these men, whom he calls my heroes, to live his life well, even now that he's left the military, and with honor.
  White told the military publication Stars and Stripes that he could see the leader's helmet and assault pack, but he couldn't tell whether the leader was alive.
  It was never a choice, he explained to CNN. I told myself from the beginning that I was going to be killed, you know just the amount of fire I'm not gonna make it through this.
  Four service members received the Medal of Honor all posthumously for actions in the war in Iraq, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.
 In a brief statement to reporters after Tuesday's ceremony, White called the Medal of Honor a symbol of the responsibility all soldiers knowingly face when they depart for distant lands in defense of the nation, a responsibility that locks us all in the bonds of brotherhood.
