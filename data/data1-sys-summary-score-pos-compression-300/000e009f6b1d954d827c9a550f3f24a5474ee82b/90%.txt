 Kyle White now has two pieces of metal to wear one, a bracelet inscribed with the names of his six comrades killed in an ambush in Afghanistan, the other, a Medal of Honor given to him for his valor that ensured that death toll wasn't higher.
 Obama called him on February 10 to tell him he'd be given the Medal of Honor.
  Four service members received the Medal of Honor all posthumously for actions in the war in Iraq, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.
 In a brief statement to reporters after Tuesday's ceremony, White called the Medal of Honor a symbol of the responsibility all soldiers knowingly face when they depart for distant lands in defense of the nation, a responsibility that locks us all in the bonds of brotherhood.
