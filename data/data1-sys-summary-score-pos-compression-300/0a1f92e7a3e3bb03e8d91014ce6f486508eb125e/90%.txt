Myls' father, Okee Wade, who has a lengthy arrest record, was jailed in New Jersey on conspiracy, theft and money laundering charges just days after dropping his son off with King in mid-December, authorities said.
 King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch on December 17 and that she was the child's primary and sole caretaker until the time of his death, the complaint said.
 King, the baby-sitter, told police that on December 29 she removed a hot rack from an oven with a glove and allegedly placed it against the boy's right leg, leaving linear burn marks, the complaint said.
