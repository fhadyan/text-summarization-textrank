Here on this Caribbean island, and on the others that make up what's known as the West Indies, life revolves around one thing cricket.
 In 1970, the International Cricket Council banned South Africa from international competition, leaving the country's cricket-mad fans deprived of the sport they loved, and their cricketers of the careers they dreamed of.
  From our point of view, we knew we had the best cricketers in the world, said former South African Cricket Union president Joe Pamensky, one of the rebel tour organizers.
 And it wasn't long before many began suspecting South Africa was also targeting a team from the West Indies, the dominant force in world cricket.
 Many big-name West Indies stars were outspoken in their refusal to play in apartheid South Africa.
  I made the decision because I wasn't getting treated right as far as the West Indies (team) was concerned, said King.
  You're not picking me, I'll go play cricket someplace where people will see proper cricket And that's why I went.
  I knew the tour was more important than being just cricket, Stephenson said.
  For the first time, they were seeing blacks beating whites, said newspaper writer Al Gilkes, the only journalist from the Caribbean to go to South Africa.
 The fate of their cricketing careers rested with the West Indies Cricket Board of Control.
 The players were aware they might face a ban after all, England's rebel team had been banned for three years; Sri Lanka's was banned for 25 years.
 In 1983, the West Indies cricket team was on top of the world.
 For the players, their lives defined by this single moment in sport history, each day is a reminder of what they lost by going to South Africa.
 And to this day, they hold strongly to the belief that being in South Africa in 1983 made a difference in disbanding apartheid, less than a decade after the West Indies players were there.
