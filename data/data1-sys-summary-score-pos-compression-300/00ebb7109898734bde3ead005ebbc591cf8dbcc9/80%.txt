 A Nebraska hate crime that targeted an openly gay woman and that triggered responses from candlelight vigils locally to Facebook postings of support nationwide was staged by the alleged victim, authorities said Tuesday as they charged the woman with lying to police.
 Charlie Rogers a former basketball player for the University of Nebraska who identifies herself as lesbian told police that three masked men entered her home on July 22, stripped her, tied her down, and carved homophobic slurs into her body before attempting to set her and the house on fire.
  Rigatuso said Tuesday.
 But the Lincoln Police Department said Tuesday that the physical evidence conflicted with Charlie Rogers' version of events and that extensive investigation revealed numerous inconsistencies.
 According to the Lincoln Police Department complaint, Rogers, 33, provided information she knew to be false with the intent to instigate an investigation of an alleged criminal matter.
 Rogers reported to police that she was lying on her bed when the alleged attackers held her down and carved derogatory words into her arms and abdomen and a cross in her chest.
