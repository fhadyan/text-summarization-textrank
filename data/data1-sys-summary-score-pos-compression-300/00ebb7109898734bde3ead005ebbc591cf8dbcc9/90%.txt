 A Nebraska hate crime that targeted an openly gay woman and that triggered responses from candlelight vigils locally to Facebook postings of support nationwide was staged by the alleged victim, authorities said Tuesday as they charged the woman with lying to police.
  Rigatuso said Tuesday.
 But the Lincoln Police Department said Tuesday that the physical evidence conflicted with Charlie Rogers' version of events and that extensive investigation revealed numerous inconsistencies.
  Rogers DNA profile was the major contributor to the DNA located on the inside of the gloves, Russell said.
