With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.
 Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.
  And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue.
 Back in 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate Gang of 8 that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.
 Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
