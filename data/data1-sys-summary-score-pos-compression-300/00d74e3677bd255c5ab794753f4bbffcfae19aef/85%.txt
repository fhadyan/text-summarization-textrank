What's the most important piece of comprehensive immigration reform you never heard of? It's fixing the legal system so it works for the future for immigrants and the U.S. economy.
 The root cause: For less-skilled foreigners who want to come to work legally in the United States, there is no line no available visas.
 What's needed is to end illegal immigration by creating ways for needed workers to come legally creating worker visas and establishing a system that allows employers who can't find enough willing and able Americans to connect easily and quickly with lawful immigrants.
  Unless we create ways for the immigrants of the future to enter legally, we're going to find ourselves in exactly the same predicament a decade or two down the road wondering what to do about 10 or 20 million unauthorized immigrants living among us but beyond the rule of law.
