 A witness has said Martin was on top of Zimmerman, Guy said.
  We are confident that at the end of this trial you will know in your head, in your heart, in your stomach that George Zimmerman did not shoot Trayvon Martin because he had to, Guy said.
  George Zimmerman who? Good, you're on the jury, he said.
  Little did George Zimmerman know at the time in less than 10 minutes from him first seeing Travyon Martin that he, George Zimmerman, would be suckered punched in the face, have his head pounded on concrete and wind up shooting and tragically killing Trayvon Martin, West told jurors.
  At the moment this actually became physical was that Trayvon Martin I will use my words that Trayvon Martin decided to confront George Zimmerman, West said.
