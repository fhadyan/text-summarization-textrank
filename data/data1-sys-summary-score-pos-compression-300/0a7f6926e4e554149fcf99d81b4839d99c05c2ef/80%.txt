LOS ANGELES, California Michael Jackson's ex-wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, has agreed not to challenge the singer's mother for custody of the children, according to a joint statement from lawyers for Rowe and Katherine Jackson.
 Jackson family lawyer Londell McMillan said the family was pleased the custody matter was resolved and was handled in a caring, thoughtful and courteous manner by the parties and their representatives.
 Rowe will get visitation rights with the children and the timing, frequency and manner of visits shall be implemented according to the best interests of the children, as determined by a child psychologist selected jointly, and paid jointly, by Jackson and Rowe, the announcement said.
 Rowe never publicly said if she would fight Jackson's 79-year-old mother for custody of her son and daughter ages 11 and 12 and a court hearing concerning custody was delayed several times this month while lawyers for the two talked.
