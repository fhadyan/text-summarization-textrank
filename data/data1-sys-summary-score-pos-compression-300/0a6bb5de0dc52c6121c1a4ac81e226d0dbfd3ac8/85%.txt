Lagos, Nigeria Nigerian aviation authorities suspended Dana Air's operating license Tuesday as torrential rain hampered recovery efforts after a deadly weekend plane crash.
  There was fire everywhere.
 The pilot declared an emergency as the plane was on final approach to Murtala Muhammed International Airport, and witnesses said it appeared the plane was having engine trouble, said Oscar Wason, Dana Air's director of operations.
 Seven U.S. citizens were aboard the flight, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday.
