A Cleveland police officer shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice about two seconds after the officer and a partner pulled up in a car to investigate reports that someone was brandishing a gun at a park, surveillance video that police released Wednesday shows.
 Video shows officer shoot Tamir.
 Between 1.5 to two seconds elapsed from the time the car pulled up to the moment Tamir was shot, Tomba said.
