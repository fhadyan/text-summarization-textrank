A Cleveland police officer shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice about two seconds after the officer and a partner pulled up in a car to investigate reports that someone was brandishing a gun at a park, surveillance video that police released Wednesday shows.
 Tamir, who had what police said is an air gun that looked like a real firearm, died Sunday, a day after he was shot outside a recreation center.
 Police have said Tamir reached into his waistband and pulled out the weapon.
 The dispatcher radioed to officers about a black male who was pointing a gun at people, but did not mention that caller's belief that he could be a minor and that the gun might not be a real firearm, one of the released recordings shows.
