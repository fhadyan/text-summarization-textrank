LOS ANGELES, California Los Angeles fire officials say they're worried that nighttime winds could push two major wildfires, which already are blamed in two deaths, closer to pricey neighborhoods on the Pacific coast.
  iReport.
  We are concerned about what will happen tonight when the winds pick up, Los Angeles Fire Chief Douglas Barry said Monday.
 Officials have shut two freeways north of Los Angeles and authorities dispatched water-dropping helicopters and more than 200 fire engines as the blaze started to push toward the city, said John Tripp of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
 That fire destroyed several structures, including about 30 mobile homes in the Lopez Canyon area, said Los Angeles County fire inspector Sam Padilla.
