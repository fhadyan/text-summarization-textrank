 While the peace deal drew criticism for the Pakistani government, some analysts and political observers say the government had little choice but to capitulate, as militants have terrorized the region with beheadings, kidnappings and the destruction of schools.
  The militants wanted sharia law or Islamic law imposed in the region.
 The central government of Pakistan, which long exerted little control in the area, launched an intense military offensive in late July to flush out the militants.
