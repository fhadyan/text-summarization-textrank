KABUL, Afghanistan Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Sunday that his country would join the strategic review of the U.S led war on terrorism.
  President Obama is a great inspiration to the world, he said.
 In an interview on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS, which aired Sunday, Karzai said that, with a resurgent Taliban, a still-flourishing drug trade and a border with Pakistan believed to be home base for al Qaeda, his country can't afford for U.S. troops to leave any time soon.
