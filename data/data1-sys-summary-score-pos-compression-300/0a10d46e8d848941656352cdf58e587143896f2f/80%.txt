KABUL, Afghanistan Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Sunday that his country would join the strategic review of the U.S led war on terrorism.
 While he said he welcomes additional U.S. troops, Karzai suggested they need to work along the Afghan-Pakistan border and in the poppy fields that fuel a drug trade that threatens to turn the nation into a narco-state not in the villages where most Afghans live.
 Speaking via satellite from Kabul, Karzai called former President George Bush a great person, but said he can work with Obama despite the president's comments as a candidate that Karzai had not gotten out of the bunker to improve security and infrastructure in Afghanistan.
  President Obama is a great inspiration to the world, he said.
 In an interview on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS, which aired Sunday, Karzai said that, with a resurgent Taliban, a still-flourishing drug trade and a border with Pakistan believed to be home base for al Qaeda, his country can't afford for U.S. troops to leave any time soon.
