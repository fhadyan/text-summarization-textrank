 Tim Kaine said Wednesday there's no legal authority for the current U.S. mission against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
  Though the language of the authorization only covers military action against those who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in recent years it has been used to cover action against any group or individual the administration considers associated with al Qaeda.
