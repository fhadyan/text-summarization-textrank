 Think again.
 Disturbingly, I have heard thoughtful colleagues wonder aloud whether the underrepresentation of Asians in senior leadership roles is due to systemic, external factors that should be addressed with reform in the workplace, or whether it's Asians who are responsible for taking themselves out of the C-suite pipeline because they're just happy being the worker bees.
  Mentors and mentees are too often arbitrarily paired in the corporate world.
  But it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers in academia, the corporate world, public service, media, entertainment and the arts, whatever path talented young people might choose to recognize the subtle, unconscious biases that sometimes prevent Asians from achieving their true potential.
  A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group.
