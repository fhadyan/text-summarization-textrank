DES MOINES, Iowa The 2016 Republican presidential race in Iowa got its unofficial start Saturday with a marathon of speeches, giving close to a dozen potential candidates a chance to introduce (or re-introduce) themselves to a core group of caucus-goers roughly one year before the contest.
  Rick Santorum who won the state's caucuses in 2012 and Huckabee, who won in 2008 â€” tried to remind Iowans why they picked them in the first place, dipping into their personalities but also focusing on the issues.
 Given King's firebrand credentials as an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, it was no surprise that problems at the border became a focal point in much of the speeches Saturday.
 The potential candidates also warned about what they see as a dire path for the country, in particular when it comes to foreign policy, a theme that, along with immigration, also seems poised to become a flash point in the 2016 presidential race, unlike in 2012..
  Cruz won huge applause for proposing to place 110,000 IRS employees on the southern border, joking that they'll do a better job at deterring illegal immigration than anything else.
  He needs it, said Ernie Rudolph of Dallas County, Iowa.
  The Hawkeye State receives outsized attention in presidential years thanks to its first-in-the-nation status during the primary season.
  Bobby Jindal, also skipped the event, but given that it's year ahead before Iowans start to caucus, it's unlikely that missing one event will hurt them.
 For the 10-hour day of back-to-back speeches, the candidates as they were called joined other high-profile Republicans at Hoyt Sherman Place, an old, intricate theater built in 1877 that also became the first public art museum in Des Moines.
