 When sheriff's deputies arrested Casey Anthony in 2008 over the death of her 2-year-old daughter, few would have anticipated it would end like this: just days after her trial, jailers arranging a clandestine release launching the Orlando woman back into a world where her story could make her rich or put her life in danger.
 What Anthony will do after her release is unclear.
 Attorney J. Cheney Mason, who once said he thought of Anthony as a granddaughter, said he doesn't know what life holds in store for his client, but has hopes.
