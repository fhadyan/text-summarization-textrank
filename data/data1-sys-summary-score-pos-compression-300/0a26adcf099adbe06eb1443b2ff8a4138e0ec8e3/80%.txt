The girl Aja Daniell Johnson was reported missing from Geronimo, Oklahoma, late Sunday, the bureau said.
  He did not specify Aja's medical condition.
 Lester Hobbs was supposed to appear in court in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, on a DUI charge, Goss said, and did not appear, so a warrant has been issued for him.
  At a hearing, Tonya Hobbs identified as Tonya Dunkin in the documents and the girl's father, John Johnson, agreed that she would have supervised visitation with Aja and keep the girl away from Lester Hobbs, the documents said.
  Hobbs and her daughter were visiting Hobbs' estranged husband, Lester William Hobbs, at his sister's home, the bureau said.
