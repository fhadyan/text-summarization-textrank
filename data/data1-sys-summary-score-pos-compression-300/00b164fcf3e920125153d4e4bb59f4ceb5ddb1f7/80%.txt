Afghan Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed the action to CNN. He said fighters will continue to attack the pro-U.S. Afghan establishment.
 Police said they believe the gunmen entered the hotel by smuggling small pistols in their shoes, then hid in the bathroom for several hours before launching their attack.
 This is latest attack to claim the lives of foreigners in the Afghan capital.
