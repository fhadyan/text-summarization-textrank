McIlroy shot a course record 7-under-par 64 at Royal Aberdeen on Thursday, and he was actually the second player to better the old mark Sweden's Kristoffer Broberg had earlier fired a 65..
  Going out this morning in these conditions I thought anything in the 60s would be a good score, so to shoot something better than that is pleasing, McIlroy was quoted as saying by the European Tour's website.
