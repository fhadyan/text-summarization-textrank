Tokyo A Japanese court has issued a landmark injunction halting plans to restart two nuclear reactors in the west of the country, citing safety concerns, a court official told CNN..
 The nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe, meeting heightened safety regulations introduced by the nuclear watchdog following the Fukushima disaster.
 It said in a statement that scientific and professional findings showed that the safety of the reactors was assured.
 But the court ruled that the new safety standards were loose, lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant, an official said.
