In a separate interview Friday with CNN, Tehran Boldon said that his brother's son is a limousine driver on the Las Vegas Strip and he called his father to warn him to avoid the area after seeing a car afire not realizing that the taxi on fire belonged to his father.
  He saw the accident and he tried to warn his dad to say avoid Flamingo (Road) because he knew his father was nearby at the Rio casino, Tehran Boldon said.
  Out of everyone I know in the rapping industry, there is no way I would have ever, ever expected to find that he was shot on the Las Vegas Strip in such an aggressive manner, said Vicki Greco, Cherry's attorney.
 The Maserati continued into the intersection of the boulevard and Flamingo Road and collided with a taxi, which caught fire, killing cab driver Michael Boldon, 62, CNN affiliate KVVU said.
