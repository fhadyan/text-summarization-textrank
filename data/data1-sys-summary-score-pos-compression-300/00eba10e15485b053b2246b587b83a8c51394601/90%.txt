In a separate interview Friday with CNN, Tehran Boldon said that his brother's son is a limousine driver on the Las Vegas Strip and he called his father to warn him to avoid the area after seeing a car afire not realizing that the taxi on fire belonged to his father.
  We lost a real patriarch and brother, said Tehran Boldon.
  The father's body was burned beyond recognition and was identified by his cab assignment, Tehran Boldon said.
