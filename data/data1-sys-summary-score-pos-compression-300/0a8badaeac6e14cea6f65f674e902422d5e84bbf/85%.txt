 The family of James McNair, the late comedian known as Jimmy Mack, has settled a lawsuit with Walmart over the auto accident that killed him and injured fellow comedian Tracy Morgan, McNair's family says.
 A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board said the Walmart truck was traveling 20 mph over the speed limit, and that its driver was almost at his drive-time limit.
  He was a humanitarian.
