 A Florida exterminator and father of four children adopted from Florida's foster care system has told police that a body found in the pest-control truck he was driving is one of them his 10-year-old daughter, authorities said Wednesday.
  Mary Olsen said.
  She added, It's a complex case.
 Barahona told police he was distraught over the death of his daughter, and had intended to commit suicide by dousing himself with gasoline and setting himself afire, the affidavit said.
