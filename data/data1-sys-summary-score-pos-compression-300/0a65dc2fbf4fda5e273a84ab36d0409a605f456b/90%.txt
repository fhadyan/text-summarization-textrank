 The father of George Zimmerman, the man accused of shooting and killing and unarmed black teen, says the teen threatened to kill Zimmerman and beat him so badly that it forced Zimmerman to shoot Trayvon Martin.
  Trayvon Martin said something to the effect of you're going to die now or you're going to die tonight, something to that effect, Robert Zimmerman told Orlando news station WOFL. He continued to beat George.
 Tracy Martin, Martin's father, said Wednesday that the 911 tape shows Zimmerman was profiling his son.
  He was knocked to the concrete.
