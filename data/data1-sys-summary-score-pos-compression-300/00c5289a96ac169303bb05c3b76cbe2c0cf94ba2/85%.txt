 The trial was scheduled to continue at 10 a.
 Jeffs began the hearing on Thursday the fifth day of his trial by asking for what he called constitutional protection because he represents a religious organization.
 The girl had grown up in Jeffs' Yearning for Zion ranch, clearing cactus and attending a Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints school where Jeffs was principal, authorities said.
 On Tuesday, the jury heard audio recordings that prosecutors said showed Jeffs instructing a 14-year-old and his other young wives on how to sexually please him in order to win God's favor.
 Jeffs' trial started last week.
 The Texas legal proceedings began after about 400 children were taken from the sect's Yearning for Zion ranch in 2008. Jeffs was also charged with bigamy after the raid and is expected to be tried on that charge later.
 Before the verdict, witnesses showed jurors DNA evidence they said showed Jeffs conceived a baby with a 15-year-old child.
