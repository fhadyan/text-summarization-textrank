Experts say it's unlikely those story lines will derail any progress Paul has made in the state with voters, but his comments could underscore questions some Republicans have about his foreign policy, especially as he seeks to broaden his appeal.
 At his first stop on Monday, which actually took place in Omaha, Nebraska, near the Iowa state line, Paul held a news conference after touring a tech startup venue with Nebraska GOP Senate hopeful Ben Sasse.
 In Iowa, Paul stressed that he never introduced legislation that solely targeted Israel and argued that he strongly favors sending money to the country.
 David Kochel, Mitt Romney's Iowa strategist in 2008 and 2012, said he doubts caucus voters will judge Paul negatively for leaving after someone tried to sandbag him.
 While Paul has voted in favor of sending more aid to Israel this year and has proposed cutting off aid to the Palestinians, his past statements and views on foreign policy are rooted in his libertarian leanings â€” a perspective still largely outside of mainstream Republican thought.
 As Paul blitzed across the Hawkeye State this week, holding events at Iowa GOP offices and campaigning for local candidates, he hardly played coy to the question of whether he was running for President.
 Paul spoke at five GOP offices this week and five other events in a tour that took him around the state in a 730-mile loop.
 Asked whether he supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, Paul said he favors the concept of traditional marriage but argued the federal government should stay out marriage entirely.
 Paul left Iowa before this weekend's annual summit hosted by the Family Leader, a group that's influential with social conservatives in the state.
