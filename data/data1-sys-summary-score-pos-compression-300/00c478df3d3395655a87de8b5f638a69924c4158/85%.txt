Kondvar said her family was told their mother's body had been taken to Emerald Funeral Home in St.
 Eager to get their mother's body back on American soil and not knowing of any alternative, the family wired the money and left their mother's passport, necessary information for the death certificate, and a set of clothes for the funeral services.
 The body that arrived in a casket at the New Jersey funeral home on December 6 was not her mother, Kondvar said.
  That never happened, Kondvar said.
 Unruh said Reed has expedited a DNA test to determine whether the body that was sent to Canada is in fact Kondvar's mother.
 As Porkka's family awaits the test results, Kondvar said she has a terrible, gut feeling the body in Canada is not her mother's.
  But Kondvar is wary.
