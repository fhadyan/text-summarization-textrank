Kondvar said her family was told their mother's body had been taken to Emerald Funeral Home in St.
 The body that arrived in a casket at the New Jersey funeral home on December 6 was not her mother, Kondvar said.
  That never happened, Kondvar said.
 Unruh said Reed has expedited a DNA test to determine whether the body that was sent to Canada is in fact Kondvar's mother.
 As Porkka's family awaits the test results, Kondvar said she has a terrible, gut feeling the body in Canada is not her mother's.
