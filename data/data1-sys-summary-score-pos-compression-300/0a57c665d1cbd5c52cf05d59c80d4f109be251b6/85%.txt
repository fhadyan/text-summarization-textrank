Estimates of the size, or yield, of the 2009 nuclear test range from 2.5 kilotons to 6 kilotons, Pinkston said.
 A 2009 report by International Crisis Group suggests that North Korea probably has somewhere between six and twelve nuclear weapons, or at least explosive devices, but notes that experts are divided on whether any of these are now usable as warheads small enough to be mounted on missiles and durable enough to withstand the hazards of flight.
