  I think this is a disheartening sign of the escalation of U.S. involvement in Honduras without clear goals and guidelines, said Dana Frank, a Honduras expert and history professor at the University of California Santa Cruz.
 The helicopters used in the operations belong to the U.S. State Department, and are piloted either by Guatemalan military pilots who are on loan, or by U.S. contractors, said Stephen Posivak, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Honduras.
 Operation Anvil seeks to track planes entering Honduras, ascertains where they will land, and then sends helicopters out to make arrests, Posivak said.
 Anvil falls within the larger framework of Central American Regional Security Initiative, or CARSI, which has provided more than half a billion dollars to the region since 2008. Besides law enforcement efforts, the money goes toward institution building and anti-corruption efforts, Posivak said.
 Given the lack of control by Honduran authorities in the northeastern part of the country, it was inevitable that the United States would play a more direct role in combating drug trafficking there, said Mark Ungar, a professor of political science and criminal justice at Brooklyn College who has studied and worked in Honduras.
  The amount of drugs seized and the disruption of narcotrafficking routes speak for themselves, said Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro, the Honduran ambassador to the United States.
