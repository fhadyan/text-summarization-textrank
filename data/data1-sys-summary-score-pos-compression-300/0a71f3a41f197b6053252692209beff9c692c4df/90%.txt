 A vote for independence would mean Scotland, with its population of about 5.3 million, splits from the rest of the United Kingdom, made up of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, in addition to Scotland.
 Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, who has led the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign, cast his ballot Thursday morning in the village of Strichen, Aberdeenshire.
 Labour lawmaker Alistair Darling, who has headed the pro-union Better Together campaign backed by the main parties in Westminster voted in Edinburgh, while former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, another pro-union campaigner, voted in the town of Kirkcaldy.
