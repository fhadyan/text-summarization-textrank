LOS ANGELES, California After about 30 hours of deliberation, a jury on Monday convicted music producer Phil Spector of second-degree murder in the death of actress Lana Clarkson more than six years ago.
 Wearing a black suit with a red tie and pocket square, Spector showed no reaction as the verdict was announced.
 Spector's professional trademark was the Wall of Sound, the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label named for Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill in the early 1960s.

 Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing, citing Spector's years-long pattern of violence involving firearms.
