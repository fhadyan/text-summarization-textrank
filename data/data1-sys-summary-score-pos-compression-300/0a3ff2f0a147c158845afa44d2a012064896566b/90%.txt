LOS ANGELES, California After about 30 hours of deliberation, a jury on Monday convicted music producer Phil Spector of second-degree murder in the death of actress Lana Clarkson more than six years ago.
 Spector's retrial began in October.
 Spector's professional trademark was the Wall of Sound, the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label named for Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill in the early 1960s.
