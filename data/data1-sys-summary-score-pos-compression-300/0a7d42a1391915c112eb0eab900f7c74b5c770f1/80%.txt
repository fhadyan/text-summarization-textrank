(Matador Network) From choosing the right festival to tips on camping and pacing yourself through the shows, here's (almost) everything you'll need to know about preparing for your next music festival.
  Generally, festivals will be teaming up with local and regional media and artists to offer unique side shows ranging from improv theater to art exhibits to on-site record stores and activist booths promoting voter registration and green initiatives.
 Most festivals provide maps pre-arrival, so you'll want to know where the camping areas are in relation to the parking and stages.
 Depending on how much sleep you want to get or how close you want to be to the action (many festivals run 24 hours you'll want to know if the camping sites are near the stages, scattered across the grounds, or both.
 If you're attending a festival located in a city or metropolitan area, such as Pitchfork in Chicago, getting a hotel room for the weekend on your own is an option, or you can take advantage of the festival's package lodging deals.
