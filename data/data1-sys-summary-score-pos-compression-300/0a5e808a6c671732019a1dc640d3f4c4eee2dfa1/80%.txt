 Nikolay Davydenko produced a ruthless display to beat U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro in straight sets to win the ATP World Tour Finals in London on Sunday.
 It capped a week of surprises at the new venue with world number two Rafael Nadal crashing out with three straight sets defeats and home hope Andy Murray edged out of the round-robin by Federer and Del Potro by the slimmest of margins.
  Congratulations.
  You are a great champion, he said.
 Del Potro looked weary after his epic three-set semifinal win over Swede Robin Soderling the previous night.
