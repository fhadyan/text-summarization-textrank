McClellan's former White House colleagues had harsher reactions to McClellan's book.
 In excerpts from a 341-page book to be released Monday, Scott McClellan writes on the war in Iraq that Bush and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war.
  I think the difference with McClellan's book is he's now telling us something we all know that the war with Iraq was a disastrous war [and] was sold with deception.
 Rove and fellow White House advisers Elliot Abrams and I. Lewis Scooter Libby were accused of leaking the name of Plame whose husband, former U.S. ambassador Joseph Wilson, had gone public with charges the Bush administration had twisted facts to justify the war in Iraq.
