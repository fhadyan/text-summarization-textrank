 North Korea has confirmed to Swedish diplomats that it is holding an American citizen, the U.S. State Department said Friday.
  We have had no word on the state of his health, whether or not the medications sent to him through the Swedish Embassy in North Korea have been delivered or why he was detained, the statement said.
  But the family of 85-year-old Merrill Newman of Palo Alto, California, has said he has been detained in North Korea since October 26..
 The family's statement came a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on North Korea to release Americans being held, calling the detentions very, very disturbing choices by the North Koreans.
 Newman's detentions bring to at least seven the number of American citizens who have been detained by North Korea, including four who allegedly entered the country illegally, according to the State Department.

  The family feels there has been some dreadful misunderstanding leading to his detention and asks that (North Korea) work to settle this issue quickly and to return this 85-year-old grandfather to his anxious, concerned family, she said in a statement.
  He has been detained somewhere in North Korea since that time, Newman's wife said in the statement.
