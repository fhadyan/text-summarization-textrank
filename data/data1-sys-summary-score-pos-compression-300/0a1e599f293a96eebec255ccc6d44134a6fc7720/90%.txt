 North Korea has confirmed to Swedish diplomats that it is holding an American citizen, the U.S. State Department said Friday.
  We have had no word on the state of his health, whether or not the medications sent to him through the Swedish Embassy in North Korea have been delivered or why he was detained, the statement said.
 The family's statement came a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on North Korea to release Americans being held, calling the detentions very, very disturbing choices by the North Koreans.
 An armistice signed in 1953 ended the three-year war between North Korea and South Korea.
