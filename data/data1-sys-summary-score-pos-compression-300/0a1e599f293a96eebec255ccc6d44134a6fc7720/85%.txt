 North Korea has confirmed to Swedish diplomats that it is holding an American citizen, the U.S. State Department said Friday.
  We have had no word on the state of his health, whether or not the medications sent to him through the Swedish Embassy in North Korea have been delivered or why he was detained, the statement said.
 The family's statement came a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on North Korea to release Americans being held, calling the detentions very, very disturbing choices by the North Koreans.
 How you travel to North Korea.
  The family feels there has been some dreadful misunderstanding leading to his detention and asks that (North Korea) work to settle this issue quickly and to return this 85-year-old grandfather to his anxious, concerned family, she said in a statement.
  He has been detained somewhere in North Korea since that time, Newman's wife said in the statement.
