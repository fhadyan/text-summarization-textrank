Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night.
 On Wednesday, a Fall River, Massachusetts, jury after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days found the former New England patriots tight end guilty of first-degree murder, which carries a penalty of life without parole, as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition.
 Nine days later, Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapons-related charges.
 Jurors also didn't hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been.
 After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said.
