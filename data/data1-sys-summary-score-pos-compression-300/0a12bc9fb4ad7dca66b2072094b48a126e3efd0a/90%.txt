Fromme was sentenced to life in prison, but parole was an option at the time, although the federal system later abolished it, said Felicia Ponce, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons.
  At the time, prison officials said they were looking into rumors that Fromme escaped after hearing Manson was ill, according to news reports.
 Virga, who is still practicing in Sacramento, said he had not heard from Fromme since her sentencing in 1975. I wish her the best, and hope everything works out for her, and hope she stays out of trouble, he said.
  A prison spokeswoman would not say whether Fromme continues to correspond with Manson.
