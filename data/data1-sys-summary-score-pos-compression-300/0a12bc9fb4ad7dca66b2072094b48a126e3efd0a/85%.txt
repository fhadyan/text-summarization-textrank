Fromme was sentenced to life in prison, but parole was an option at the time, although the federal system later abolished it, said Felicia Ponce, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons.
 Fromme became eligible for parole in 1985, Ponce said.
  At the time, prison officials said they were looking into rumors that Fromme escaped after hearing Manson was ill, according to news reports.
 Fromme reportedly joined Manson's family after meeting him in California in 1967. She was not involved in the murders of seven people, including pregnant actress Sharon Tate, on August 9 and 10, 1969, that landed Manson and other followers in prison.
 In the WCHS interview, Fromme said that Manson should not be incarcerated because he didn't kill anybody.
 Virga, who is still practicing in Sacramento, said he had not heard from Fromme since her sentencing in 1975. I wish her the best, and hope everything works out for her, and hope she stays out of trouble, he said.
