Nishikori left Japan for Bollettieri's Florida academy aged just 13 without a grasp of English, but the intensive work on his game bore fruit within five years as he lifted his first ATP Tour title in Delray Beach.
 In 2012 he became the first Japanese player to reach the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in 80 years and then went on to win the Japan Open the first home-grown talent to do so in the tournament's 41-year history.
  Beating Roger this year and beating Djokovic two years ago that is why I am playing tennis, to play those top 10 guys and to beat them.
  11 he is the highest ranked Asian male player by a distance the next in line is Yen-Hsun Lu from Chinese Tapei in 60th and Nishikori wants to blaze a trail like Li Na who won China's first ever grand slam at the women's French Open in 2011..
 This surge towards the game's pinnacle has elevated Nishikori to rock star-like status in his home country, its population clamoring for their first ever grand slam champion.
