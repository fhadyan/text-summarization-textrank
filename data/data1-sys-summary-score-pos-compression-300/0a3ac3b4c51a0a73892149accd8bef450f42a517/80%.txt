In Gwinnett County, Georgia, just outside Atlanta, firefighters said Tuesday they found the body of a man who drowned in a rain-swollen creek near Norcross.
 A flooding death was also reported in rural northeast Mississippi, where one person drowned after floodwater swept away a vehicle in Tishomingo County, emergency officials said.
 CNN's Sarah Dillingham contributed to this report.
  A news release from the D.C. Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency urged people to avoid driving when possible, drive very carefully when you must drive, and stay alert for pooling water that you cannot drive through.
