 Authorities scoured the national park around Washington's Mount Rainier on Sunday for a man they say fatally shot a park ranger and fled into the woods, a park spokeswoman said.
 The suspect remained at large Sunday night, believed to be somewhere in the expansive park, Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Lee Taylor said.
  Taylor said that authorities were able to evacuate most of the people safely, with more than 100 people holed up in our primary visitor center with food, water and five law enforcement officers standing guard.
