London, England Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup.
 The Irish Justice Ministry confirmed to CNN that Dermot Ahern had asked the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to demand a replay in the interests of fair play.
  Millions of people worldwide saw it was a blatant double handball not to mention a double offside and we should put the powers that be in the cozy world of FIFA on the spot and demand a replay, Ahern said in a statement sent to CNN..
