London, England Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup.
 Television cameras showed Henry guiding the ball with his hand twice, before William Gallas scored from his resulting cross to give Les Bleus a narrow win in the two-legged World Cup play-off against the Republic of Ireland.
  Henry is their captain and a wonderful footballer, but does he want to be like Diego Maradona and his legacy to be this handball, this goal that got them to the World Cup in an unjust manner? If we had qualified in this manner, I wouldn't be happy, he said.
 The FAI has argued that there is a precedent for the result to be struck out, following FIFA's ruling that Uzbekistan had to replay a play-off against Bahrain for the 2006 World Cup in Germany after the referee made a mistake in awarding a penalty.
  You don't get a reaction like that.
  Millions of people worldwide saw it was a blatant double handball not to mention a double offside and we should put the powers that be in the cozy world of FIFA on the spot and demand a replay, Ahern said in a statement sent to CNN..
