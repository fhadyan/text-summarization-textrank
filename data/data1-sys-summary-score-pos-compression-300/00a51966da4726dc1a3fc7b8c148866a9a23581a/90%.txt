Two car bombs targeting Christians killed at least 38 people in southern Baghdad on Christmas.
  The group said it fired missiles at the U.S. Embassy and the main base of NATO, which leads the military coalition known as the International Security Assistance Force.
  In another attack Wednesday, a car bomb went off at an outdoor market where many Christians shop, police said.
