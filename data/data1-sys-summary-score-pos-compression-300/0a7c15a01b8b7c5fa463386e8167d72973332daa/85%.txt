A lawyer for Gadhafi's son Saadi, who fled in September to Niger, issued a statement Sunday saying, Saadi Gadhafi is shocked and outraged by the vicious brutality which accompanied the murders of his father and brother.
  The contradictory statements issued by the NTC excusing these barbaric executions and the grotesque abuse of the corpses make it clear that no person affiliated with the former regime will receive a fair trial in Libya nor will they receive justice for crimes committed against them, the statement said.
  More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi was shot in the head, dying moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, citing the city's coroner.
