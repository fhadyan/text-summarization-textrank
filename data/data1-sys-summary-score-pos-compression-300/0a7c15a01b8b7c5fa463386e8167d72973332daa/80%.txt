 Othman el-Zentani would not disclose whether findings revealed if Gadhafi suffered the wound in crossfire or at close-range a key question that has prompted the United Nations and international human rights groups to call for an investigation into the final moments of the late Libyan strongman's life.
 An amateur video distributed by the Reuters news agency Sunday showed NTC fighters congratulating a man the fighters say killed Gadhafi.
  The contradictory statements issued by the NTC excusing these barbaric executions and the grotesque abuse of the corpses make it clear that no person affiliated with the former regime will receive a fair trial in Libya nor will they receive justice for crimes committed against them, the statement said.
  More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi was shot in the head, dying moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, citing the city's coroner.
 No foreign or independent officials were present, Zentani said.
