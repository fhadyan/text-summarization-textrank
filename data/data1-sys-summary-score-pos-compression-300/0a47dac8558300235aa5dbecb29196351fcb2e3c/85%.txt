 Spain has now been victorious at every level in the United States courts, from Tampa to Atlanta to Washington, said Jim Goold, who defended Spain's claim to the treasure.
 In 2009, the federal court in Tampa ruled in favor of Spain and the federal appeals court in Atlanta upheld the ruling last September.
 The appeals court is expected to send the case back to the court in Tampa, which would establish and supervise the procedures for sending the coins to Spain, Goold said last week.
  Kingdom of Spain.
