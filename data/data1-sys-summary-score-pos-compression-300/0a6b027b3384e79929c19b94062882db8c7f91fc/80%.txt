Relegation dogfight.
 Aston Villa continued their good form since appointing coach Tim Sherwood with a 1-0 victory over Tottenham, who fired Sherwood last season.
 Another Midlands club looking over their shoulder is West Brom, who conceded an injury time goal to lose 3-2 against bottom club Leicester City.
 Good form.
 Arsenal have been in superb form since the start of the year, transforming what looked to be another mediocre season struggling to secure fourth place and with it Champions League qualification into one where they at least have a shot at winning the title.
