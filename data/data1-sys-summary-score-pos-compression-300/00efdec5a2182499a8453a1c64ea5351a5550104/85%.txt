 An official in Inner Mongolia is disputing an Amnesty International report that parts of the region are under martial law.
 According to the human rights organization, 2,000 Mongolian students took to the streets Wednesday in Xilinhot, in a show of solidarity with an ethnic Mongolian herder by the name of Mergen, who was killed earlier this month when he was hit by a coal truck that was driven by ethnic Hans.
