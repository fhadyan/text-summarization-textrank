The students were marching toward the building that houses the regional government, shouting, defend our land and defend our rights, according to the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center.
  There were no demonstrations or protests, Chao said Monday.
 According to the human rights organization, 2,000 Mongolian students took to the streets Wednesday in Xilinhot, in a show of solidarity with an ethnic Mongolian herder by the name of Mergen, who was killed earlier this month when he was hit by a coal truck that was driven by ethnic Hans.
