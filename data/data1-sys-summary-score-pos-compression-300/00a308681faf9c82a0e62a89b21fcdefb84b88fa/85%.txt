After a weekend of intense investigation, authorities are piecing together more details about Friday's fatal shooting at Los Angeles International Airport, including the suspect's behavior earlier in the week and a warning from his family that may have come minutes too late.
 Officers sent to check on Paul Ciancia's welfare arrived at his apartment less than an hour after the shooting started, police said Monday.
 According to someone who knew Ciancia and his three roommates well, Ciancia began asking for a ride to the airport days before the shooting.
  He claimed he needed to fly to New Jersey to help his sick father, but he never said what day he needed to leave, the source said.
 Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said the FBI told him that his officers were 60 seconds behind Ciancia.
  It is most important for us as a family to express our deep and sincere sympathy to the Hernandez family, the Ciancia family said.
 The Ciancia family said they would continue to love and care for Paul.
 But a note found on Ciancia indicated that he wanted to kill Transportation Security Administration employees to instill fear in what the suspect called the agents' traitorous minds, FBI Special Agent in Charge David Bowdich said.
