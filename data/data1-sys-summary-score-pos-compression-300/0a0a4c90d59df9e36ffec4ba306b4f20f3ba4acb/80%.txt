 Can a movie actually convince you to support torture? Can a movie really persuade you that fracking a process used to drill for natural gas is a danger to the environment? Can a movie truly cause you to view certain minority groups in a negative light?.
 Critics of Zero Dark Thirty fear that audiences will accept as true the film's story line that torture was effective in eliciting information to locate bin Laden.
 Opposition to the film escalated last week as three senior U.S. senators John McCain, Carl Levin and Dianne Feinstein sent a letter to the film's distributor, Sony Pictures, characterizing the film's use of torture as grossly inaccurate and misleading.
  The senators bluntly informed Sony Pictures that it has an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden is not based on the facts, but rather part of the film's fictional narrative.
