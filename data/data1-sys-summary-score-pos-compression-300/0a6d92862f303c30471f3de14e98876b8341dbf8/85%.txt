  The Hotel Altstadt is located in the arty Spittelberg district, just behind the MuseumsQuartier and features an impressive contemporary art and design collection; Das Tyrol, a cozy former monastery with a small spa, features art works by young Viennese artists; the Konig von Ungarn has the benefit of being in the same complex of 300-year-old buildings as Mozart's one-time living quarters; and the Hilton Vienna Danube has views over the river.
 The Museum features Klimt's Beethoven mural, but to see his famed golden-hued painting The Kiss, head to the Belvedere Museum, housed in a magnificent palace built in the 1700s.
