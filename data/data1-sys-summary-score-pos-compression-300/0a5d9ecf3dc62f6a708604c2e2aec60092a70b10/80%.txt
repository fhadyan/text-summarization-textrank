 In one recently published study, six international research teams led by scientists from NOAA and a number of countries investigated seven different 2011 extreme weather and climate events.
  In six of the seven, there was sufficient evidence to conclude that climate change caused by human activities played a factor in the events affecting their severity, likelihood or frequency.
 Among those events exacerbated by climate change were heat waves in Texas and Oklahoma, the East African drought and extreme temperatures in Europe and England.
 One upward trend is indisputable: At NOAA, requests for climate data have skyrocketed, and those data are increasingly helping stakeholders cope with extreme events.
 Electric utilities count on climate data to anticipate peak power requirements and distribute power where it is needed.
