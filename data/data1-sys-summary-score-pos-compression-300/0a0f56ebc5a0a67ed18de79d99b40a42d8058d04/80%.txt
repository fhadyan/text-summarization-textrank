 The man suspected of trying to attack the Dutch royal family by crashing his car near their bus has died, Dutch police said Friday.
 The attack caused outrage in the Netherlands, newspapers Friday widely expressing disbelief and suggesting the monarchy would have to change.
 Police searched the man's house but found no weapons, explosives, or any other clues that could lead to the involvement of other people, police said.
 Five people, as well as the driver, were killed and 12 were wounded in the incident, which happened during the country's annual Queen's Day celebration, police said.
