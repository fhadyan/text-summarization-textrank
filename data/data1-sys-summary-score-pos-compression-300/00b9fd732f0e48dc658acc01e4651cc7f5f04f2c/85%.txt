 I've got to push back for a second, because a lot of people will tell you you can be happier with a cell phone because you're out of the office and you're with your family more, still able to still do business.
  There's an interesting article in the recent Christian Science Monitor that shows the actual cost of using a cell phone could be more than $3 a minute by time you factor in unused minutes and so on.
  All right.
  Can you give up one? The Auto Club says it costs about, on average, $1 a mile to drive a car by the time you factor in the cost of the car, depreciation and so on.
 Collins: OK. Give up meals prepared outside your home.
  You can cut that by 80 percent by cooking those same meals at home and you know, maybe recapture some family time around the dinner table.
