 The autopilot follows the course put into the flight management system by the pilots  The manual control part is easy  The flight management system part is very complicated  Even after a few hours of professional instruction I would have been unable to program the flight management system to command the autopilot to fly the flight plan that Flight 370 reportedly flew  Either the flight was commandeered by a group with at least one professionally trained pilot among them or one of the pilots in control programmed the new off-route flight plan into the flight management system The latter would be far more likely  In the case of Flight 370, it would almost certainly have remained on autopilot, which would have dutifully followed the flight plan in the flight management system That flight plan was quite possibly entered for some mysterious reason by a trained pilot
