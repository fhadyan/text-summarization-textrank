 Jeff Yeager says the economic downturn is an opportunity for people to simplify their lives and be content with less  Maybe we can simplify our lives, be content with less and actually enjoy life more  And again, I don't really talk about a life of sacrifice  I talk about a life of choices and how, in many instances, less can be more  The secret to the time is being content with less  Really?  It's about changing your life and maybe in the end being happier  Give up meals prepared outside your home Yeager: More than 40 percent of the average American family household food budget is spent on meals prepared outside the home  You can cut that by 80 percent by cooking those same meals at home and you know, maybe recapture some family time around the dinner table  Every dinner, every business meeting, every lunch  Less than 2 percent of clothes that we throw away in America are worn out  The average family spends about $1,800 on clothing Yeager: And again, less than 2 percent of the clothes we throw away are worn out
