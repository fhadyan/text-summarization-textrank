White himself insisted that the Medal of Honor cannot really be an individual award, calling it a testament to the trust we have in each other and our leaders  White ran toward him, braving enemy fire White was able to drag the wounded man back to the tree  White had to see, he said White crawled toward the man White figured he would be killed  And I vow to live up to the responsibility of doing so, White said A soldier, changed  It's something you still think about every day, White said  he told NPR White first returned home and trained other paratrooopers As such, White couldn't help but think about his brothers in arms  Without the team, he said, there could be no Medal of Honor  That is why I wear this medal for my team
