 Hopeful because it means there's something every one of us can do about it I'm talking about breaking the habit of faking knowledge in order to save face  Politicians routinely face shame if they confess to not knowing  Own up to instances when we faked knowledge  Initiate conversations about what makes us more or less susceptible to this behavior Her students, anxious to deliver the right answer, would demand clarification  If her students protested, she'd say simply, That's all I know And so they'd be forced to grapple not only with the answer to her question, but with the meaning of her question, with the definition of power in the first place, which she, the authority figure, had just handed over to them: You guys figure it out  You decide  But we won't ever achieve equity let alone excellence if we don't also work to make our schools places where we all feel safe saying I don't know  Pressure to know the right answer (or, more precisely, to appear to know) isn't limited to the classroom
