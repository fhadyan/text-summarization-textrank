 Marco Rubio is all in Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration  So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken  But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less  Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic  By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters  Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates
