 The inaugural addresses of the presidents are, for the most part, a wasteland of howling rhetoric and dried-out inspiration Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it Theodore Roosevelt failed  Barack Obama failed the first time, and since second inaugural addresses are almost always even worse than firsts, it seems almost certain he'll fail again on Monday Why do inaugural addresses fail? They fail, first, because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric, even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments Consider, for example, this passage from Obama's first inaugural address:  Inaugural addresses can fail even when the ideas are clear, even when the writing is fine, if the addresses make commitments that the ensuing presidency cannot deliver  Garfield An inaugural address is a plan for what is to come  Even a good president can deliver a bad speech A speech can fail all by itself Who said that? It could have been any one of 20 presidents
