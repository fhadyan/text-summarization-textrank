 We don't know much about the shooting at Los Angeles International Airport just yet, but it has clearly jangled our collective nerves, dredging up the fear and shock and pain of 9/11 the wellspring of our modern airport security process reminding us that more than a decade later, flying is still a fraught experience LAX shooting delays flights nationwide Even before 9/11, it made me nervous that as airline workers, we skipped security entirely, simply hopping off the employee bus and entering a back door, bags and bodies unscreened  Of course, I was wrong, and thankfully employees' bags are now screened, but giving guns to airline and airport workers is still a disquieting idea I was never a fan of armed pilots, even in the nightmarish days after 9/11 Chaos, terror unfold inside LAX Terminal 3 Unquestionably, terrorism is a real concern for airlines, but like it or not, as Americans, we have also have to worry just as much about angry neighbors with guns So, reports of today's airport shooting raise new fears about weaknesses in this system
