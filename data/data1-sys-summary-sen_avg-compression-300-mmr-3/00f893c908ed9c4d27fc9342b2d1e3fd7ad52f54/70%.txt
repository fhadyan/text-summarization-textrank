Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic once again faces two genocide charges instead of one in his long-running trial over ethnic violence during the 1990s Balkan wars Victims of the massacre have been buried at the site periodically as officials locate and identify more victims in mass graves The 1992-95 Bosnian conflict was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia His former military commander, Ratko Mladic, was captured in 2011 and is also on trial for charges including genocide But the appellate judges Thursday ruled that the evidence of serious abuse against Bosnian Muslims and Croats including detaining them in overcrowded, squalid conditions where they were starved and left vulnerable to disease could be shown to be genocidal acts The judges cited allegations that Karadzic and officials loyal to him decided on a plan to rid Bosnia of Muslims, in part by killing a third of them and converting another third to Orthodox Christianity
