Washington The much-maligned, color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System is about to be consigned to the proverbial dustbin of history  I expect the biggest challenge for DHS will be balancing the need to provide useful and timely information with the need to protect sensitive information President George W Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is expected to announce Thursday that the almost 9-year-old threat alert system will go away in April The general threat level is yellow/elevated Almost from the start, the threat level system was the butt of jokes and multiple parodies A Total Headcase Advisory System began with George Soros is arrested and ended with Hillary Clinton is elected president  It will be replaced by the new National Terror Advisory System that will focus on specific threats in geographical areas, a department source said Wednesday  Still another announced that Homeland Security and Crayola had jointly revised the system, changing green to aquamarine, blue to raw umber, yellow to burnt sienna, orange to neon carrot and red to cotton candy The council included Attorney General John Ashcroft, FBI chief Robert Mueller, CIA director George Tenet, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell  Sometimes we disagreed with the intelligence assessment And in 2009, Ridge wrote in a tell-all book that sometimes officials such as Ashcroft and Rumsfeld pressured the department to change the level, describing a 2004 event in which his arguments against raising the alert worked The source did not provide details of the new system, which Napolitano will unveil at what the department is calling the first annual 'State of America's Homeland Security' address at George Washington University The Bush administration denied Ridge's assertions, however Townsend is now a national security contributor for CNN  Though the system served a valuable purpose in the terrible days and months following the terrorist attacks of September 11, it was clearly time for the current color-coded system to be replaced with a more targeted system, King said
