Here on this Caribbean island, and on the others that make up what's known as the West Indies, life revolves around one thing cricket Murray agreed  I don't see the mercenary part of it or whatever At the same time, a world away, South Africa was deep in the heart of apartheid As the world tried to pressure South Africa's leadership, sanctions were applied, and sport was no exception On this night, locals gather at historic Kensington Oval, which hosted the 2007 World Cup final  You're always optimistic, said former South African cricketer Clive Rice  The stupidity that existed would change and South Africa would change much quicker, and we'd be back playing international sport 'Rebel tours' To save cricket in South Africa, the sport's administrators knew something had to be done So, in secret, they began planning rebel tours inviting various teams from around the world  From our point of view, we knew we had the best cricketers in the world, said former South African Cricket Union president Joe Pamensky, one of the rebel tour organizers And it wasn't long before many began suspecting South Africa was also targeting a team from the West Indies, the dominant force in world cricket  You heard a lot of whispers around the place that perhaps these guys were going to South Africa, recalled broadcaster Tony Cozier Many big-name West Indies stars were outspoken in their refusal to play in apartheid South Africa Captain Clive Lloyd said no amount of money could get him there But other players were tempted  I made the decision because I wasn't getting treated right as far as the West Indies (team) was concerned, said King  And I said to myself, 'Well, cricket is my job More than just cricket  He had repeatedly turned down offers to play in South Africa  When we got to South Africa, I realized that separation, and it wasn't only black and white, he said  It seemed South African fans couldn't get enough of the black cricketers from the West Indies  They say the presence of a team of black men in South Africa did not help end apartheid, but instead strengthened and supported it Even within the country itself, non-whites protested the West Indies rebels Back home in the Caribbean, the reaction was worse The fate of their cricketing careers rested with the West Indies Cricket Board of Control  Many of them were destroyed as cricketers, said University of West Indies Professor Hilary Beckles  Their cricket careers came to an end In 1983, the West Indies cricket team was on top of the world His wife gave birth to their baby daughter in Australia, while Murray was playing in South Africa  Nobody looked out for us, Stephenson said And to this day, they hold strongly to the belief that being in South Africa in 1983 made a difference in disbanding apartheid, less than a decade after the West Indies players were there
