Authorities descended on the scene, and when one of the suspected traffickers aboard the plane allegedly made a threatening move, two Drug Enforcement Agency officers opened fire, agency spokeswoman Barbara Carreno said The pair of shootings by DEA agents follow an episode in May in which villagers in the country's Mosquitia coastal region say Honduran forces aboard American helicopters mistakenly fired on a civilian riverboat, killing four, including two pregnant women  involvement in Honduras without clear goals and guidelines, said Dana Frank, a Honduras expert and history professor at the University of California Santa Cruz  There is no clear oversight from Congress over what is going on, she said  contingent is called, serves purely as a support element, providing re-fueling capability, communications infrastructure and medical evacuation capability at the forward bases, said Lt  contractors, said Stephen Posivak, spokesman for the U  Embassy in Honduras What's not new is the teamwork between the DEA and vetted Honduran police who participate in the operations, Posivak said  This concept is new, but previously there's been these type of bi-national efforts done by the Honduran government and DEA, he said Operation Anvil seeks to track planes entering Honduras, ascertains where they will land, and then sends helicopters out to make arrests, Posivak said The DEA is in Honduras at the request of our government in a support and training capacity, Hernandez said  Besides law enforcement efforts, the money goes toward institution building and anti-corruption efforts, Posivak said  It's not a problem that can be solved by law enforcement alone, he said The goal is to address security concerns through all means, he said  For us who gain no benefit, these costs are unacceptable, Pastor said They wrote the letter, he said, because Hondurans are fearful of the prospect of militarization without end Hernandez, the Honduran ambassador, counters that Operation Anvil and other programs are not military operations, but law enforcement ones Drug cartels exert such influence in the region that both law enforcement and civilian government agencies have been corrupted, he said Just as part of the counterinsurgency missions in Afghanistan and Iraq had an element of earning locals' trust, the same is needed in Honduras, Ungar said As of Wednesday, authorities said, they had interdicted five planes, seized about 2,300 kilos of cocaine, and made seven arrests  These factors are not favorable for long-term success, he said Posivak, the U  embassy spokesman, said Operation Anvil has already proven successful at disrupting criminal organizations  We believe these interdictions have had a strong impact, he said  The amount of drugs seized and the disruption of narcotrafficking routes speak for themselves, said Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro, the Honduran ambassador to the United States
