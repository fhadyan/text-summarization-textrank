 contractors, said Stephen Posivak, spokesman for the U  Embassy in Honduras What's not new is the teamwork between the DEA and vetted Honduran police who participate in the operations, Posivak said Operation Anvil seeks to track planes entering Honduras, ascertains where they will land, and then sends helicopters out to make arrests, Posivak said The DEA is in Honduras at the request of our government in a support and training capacity, Hernandez said  Besides law enforcement efforts, the money goes toward institution building and anti-corruption efforts, Posivak said The goal is to address security concerns through all means, he said  For us who gain no benefit, these costs are unacceptable, Pastor said Hernandez, the Honduran ambassador, counters that Operation Anvil and other programs are not military operations, but law enforcement ones Drug cartels exert such influence in the region that both law enforcement and civilian government agencies have been corrupted, he said As of Wednesday, authorities said, they had interdicted five planes, seized about 2,300 kilos of cocaine, and made seven arrests  These factors are not favorable for long-term success, he said  embassy spokesman, said Operation Anvil has already proven successful at disrupting criminal organizations  The amount of drugs seized and the disruption of narcotrafficking routes speak for themselves, said Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro, the Honduran ambassador to the United States
