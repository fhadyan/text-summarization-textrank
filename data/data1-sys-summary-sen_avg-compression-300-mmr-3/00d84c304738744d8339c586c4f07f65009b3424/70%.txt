This past May, disgust for the IRS reached an all-time high when Lois Lerner, director of the IRS's Exempt Organizations unit, disclosed the agency had improperly targeted social welfare organizations seeking special status under section 501(c 4) of the tax code based on their political ideology  Federal law requires these groups to operate exclusively for purposes beneficial to the community as a whole  IRS regulations, however, create a loophole in the law by allowing groups primarily engaged in these types of activities to benefit from this tax status  Many 501(c 4) groups have interpreted this regulation to mean they can spend up to 49% of their funds on political activities mostly negative, deceptive political ads  Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and other public interest groups filed a similar lawsuit last month With more and more groups seeking to participate in federal elections using money raised from donors who want to remain anonymous, applications to the IRS for 501(c 4) status more than doubled between 2010 and 2012 Read the IRS inspector general's report on targeting As the 2014 election cycle gets under way, the super rich and corporations with deep coffers will continue to buy our elections, and Congress will continue to spend time and resources on a never-ending cycle of investigations into a problem with a fairly easy solution: as Congress intended when it first passed the law, prohibit 501(c 4) organizations from spending money on anything other than social welfare activities Got a story idea or tip for CNN's investigations team?
