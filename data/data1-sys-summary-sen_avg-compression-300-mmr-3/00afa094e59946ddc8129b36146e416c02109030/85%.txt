Kyaw Thu's society relies on donations and an army of volunteers around 500 a day who do everything from carrying caskets to preparing bodies for burial Message to Burmese people: 'Please be united'  People are not following their speech  They say we love Aung San Suu Kyi, we love General Aung San but they're not following their policy He said the society has not been allowed to travel west to Rakhine State where Rohingya Muslims are alleged by human rights groups to be suffering systematic abuse amounting to ethnic cleansing  Decades of military rule had produced bad attitudes, he said Han Thar Nyein contributed to this report  At the time, it wasn't uncommon; poor families would often sneak out in the dead of night to bury their dead, he said And so began the Free Funeral Service Society, founded in collaboration with multi-award winning late Burmese writer and director Thukha, which now also provides a free library, education, medical, dental care and disaster relief
