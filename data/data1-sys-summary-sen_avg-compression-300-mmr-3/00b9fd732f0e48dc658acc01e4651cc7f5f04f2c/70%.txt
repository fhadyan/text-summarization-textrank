 And that's really what I write about is, maybe there's a silver lining to this economic downturn  Maybe we can simplify our lives, be content with less and actually enjoy life more  As a fellow Midwesterner, I share your cheapskate thoughts already You know, in this economy, we hear a lot of stories about how to get more stuff for 20 percent less  The savings don't necessarily require sacrifices, he says, but rather choices that can lead to greater happiness  Really?  Well, very good Yeager: Give up the cellulite life  I will use myself as a poster child  Average cell phone plan costs about $100 a month  Quit going out for meals no matter what, if it's just a salad or a fancy fancy dinner? Yeager: More than 40 percent of the average American family household food budget is spent on meals prepared outside the home  Every dinner, every business meeting, every lunch Collins: Yes, yes  All right, you also say quit shopping for new clothes  Less than 2 percent of clothes that we throw away in America are worn out  The average family spends about $1,800 on clothing  Certainly most of us have more than enough stuff in our closet that we could go six months, even a year without buying new clothes  Accessorize, I don't know, right?  That's a waste of the Earth's resources Back in my days, lots of people, including myself, lived at home when we went to college  Therefore, we didn't take out any college student loans  When they graduate, what do they do? They move back home with mom and dad! Let's skip the money step!  We led sort of a simpler life, and I think, in a lot of ways, happier, Heidi
