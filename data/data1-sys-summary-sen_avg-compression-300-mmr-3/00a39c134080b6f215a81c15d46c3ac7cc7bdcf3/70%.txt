ATLANTA, Georgia Dressed head to toe in black, designer Isaac Mizrahi is wearing an outfit that seems to contradict his personality and his usual fashion flair Isaac Mizrahi has earned four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America CNN talked to Mizrahi about his love for theater, the most common fashion mistakes and why bad flowers are never OK Like women say, Oh, that's a brand name I associate with because I've worn it before  There's a movie called Unzipped about me that was a really successful movie Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that  Always I don't really love travel CNN: Say you're walking down the street  What's the most common style error that you see in people? Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair You know people have excuses for bad shoes because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they're walking and walking and walking but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair  Because you know what? There's a hat, if your hair is really that bad that day  I like to think about cabinets  I like to put things away as much as possible  I think that nothing is way better than bad flowers  Like at a dinner party, I prefer no flowers usually to the flowers that people have on the table  That's awful, but it's true  I used to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, and I don't know, I dress in a very particular way now and it's almost like clockwork Mizrahi: I don't know Oh! Here's a good description of my personality: claustrophobic For five years, the New York fashion designer has been selling low-priced clothing and home furnishings at Target  But with his new book comes a new job as the creative director of Liz Claiborne
