 My ranges are full of influences from 19th-century French, English, even American vintage styles Honestly, I can give them any old historical piece that I've found and they will either take it away and recreate it almost perfectly, or they'll say hmmm I don't know this stitching, but I know a place nearby that does  It's a fashion designer's dream!  However, I think this was the first time I've traveled to India with a conscious intention to create a fusion of styles: their own traditional dress with my more modern, western creations Walking through the streets, you see color combinations that you'd never imagine would work  I recall a beautiful woman wearing a sari in bright, radiant pink mixed with a lime green print We made our way to a shop that I can only describe as a treasure trove of fabrics and other goodies  This was the place to find all the accessories, textiles, ribbons, bows, buttons, and beads that I could take back to my studio in Auckland to use as inspiration for the final creations  Already I could envisage opportunities to use all sorts of different laces and braids, detailed examples of hand stitching, with some other antique dresses we'd picked up from a local supplier Cooper took up the Fusion Journey challenge to travel from New Zealand to New Delhi, India's capital See more Fusion Journeys Trelise Cooper: I absolutely adore the historical aspect of clothing
