 I don't think we have time to think of Carnival, Lassegue said Instead, the displaced are planning days of prayer Haitians have celebrated Carnival through dictatorships, military coups and bloodshed  Her brother died and suddenly, she found herself far from her middle-class existence, relegated to a makeshift tent and burlap bags she uses for pillows at night  Now I have four sheets, she said Baduel and her tent community neighbors said the money that would have been spent on Carnival ought to be used to build housing They played the Sunday before the earthquake, marching through the streets, getting ready for the big performance  Almost every band in Haiti debuts new pieces at Carnival Musicians fell silent, seamstresses stopped sewing costumes and ghostly skeletons of unfinished floats lay scattered on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince  Music, Martino said, was so essential to Haitian life  Carnival, he said, was Haiti's musical showcase  We've lost our biggest tradition  This is the first time Carnival is not happening, said Roberto Martino, lead singer of popular Kompa band T-Vice
