The 50-plus Oscar winner, producer and political activist George Clooney is apparently engaged to be married  He's a gifted, idiosyncratic, goes-his-own-way, irreverent kind of guy  In his films, he has played lost middle-aged men, lost in their careers, lost in neglected marriages, lost because of a lack of connection to something important Up in the Air, The Descendents, Michael Clayton, among others  Many of these men reshuffle their lives, readjust their principles or at least find some self knowledge they sorely lacked What we know about Amal Alamuddin  Clooney's doing that middle-aged love choice Middle age is an important time for reassessment and course correction Sometime in this period, the thrill seekers and lust lovers get their whiff of mortality (perhaps because of their latest motorcycle accident) and they turn to love with a new sense of its gravitas  (Hint: watch for children) It might irk Clooney to be seen as so predictable
