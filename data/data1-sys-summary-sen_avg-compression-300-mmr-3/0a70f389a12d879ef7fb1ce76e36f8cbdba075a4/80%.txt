The 50-plus Oscar winner, producer and political activist George Clooney is apparently engaged to be married  He's a gifted, idiosyncratic, goes-his-own-way, irreverent kind of guy  Many of these men reshuffle their lives, readjust their principles or at least find some self knowledge they sorely lacked  Clooney's doing that middle-aged love choice Middle age is an important time for reassessment and course correction Sometime in this period, the thrill seekers and lust lovers get their whiff of mortality (perhaps because of their latest motorcycle accident) and they turn to love with a new sense of its gravitas  (Hint: watch for children)
