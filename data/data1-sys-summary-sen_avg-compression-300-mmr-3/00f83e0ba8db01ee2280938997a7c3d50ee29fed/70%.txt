Trial 'will not bring back the dead' Suffering under the Khmer Rouge Like many families, my mother, my deaf sister, Keo Kolthida Ekkasakh, and I, all suffered under the Khmer Rouge  And my mother lost all three of her brothers, one sister, one daughter and many grandchildren under the regime Society is still divided, and the memories of this period— even memories of kindness — carry a heavy burden 'Too little, too late' Time and again, the international community has watched mass atrocities, genocide, and other heinous crimes proceed unchecked INTERACTIVE: Five faces of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge We must seize the opportunity to stand up for what is right, no matter the circumstance, because we know that saving millions of lives today speaks far greater for our civilization than issuing verdicts tomorrow If only the international community would exercise the courage and resolve as the man in prison did for me, the world would need fewer verdicts In 2013: Infamous leader during Cambodia genocide dies Surprisingly, the prison chief agreed and I was released My experience is a mere footnote to the millions of other Cambodians who suffered and died at the hands of this regime, but it is illustrative of the ongoing struggle to find justice and closure
