BEIJING, China Soon after I first came to visit China in the autumn of 1971, I saw a contingent of militia soldiers doing marching drills in Tiananmen Square  For ten years, China was condemned to political turmoil and economic malaise  In 1972, the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the United Nations Not every Chinese embraced Deng's reform and open-door policy  China went from global economic irrelevance to the third largest economy in the world  Fireworks will cap the festivities But pomp and pageantry aside, China's phenomenal economic growth over the decades has triggered unintended consequences: rising unemployment, growing income gaps, endemic corruption, rising criminality, environmental degradation and social malaise  The emperor is now history, but Tiananmen remains Beijing's political center It was on the Tiananmen rostrum where Chairman Mao formally proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic
