Kamberg, South Africa Sunlight sparkles through the drops of water that tumble off the edge of the cliff  Painted on the rock face behind the tiny waterfall are a pair of faded eland, the largest antelope in Africa Scattered throughout these mountains are some 60,000 individual images, visible at about 600 different sites  The artists used the blood and fat of the eland as well as whitened clay, bird droppings and charcoal as pigments  Behind them are two barely visible human figures  Water is important for all life, and it was important for the people who lived here  It's hard to date these paintings, Raphael explains
