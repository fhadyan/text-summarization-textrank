Some reports suggest some black Ugandan workers resented how certain sections of the Indian mercantile class treated them These days, however, Kakira says it strives to promote a responsible philosophy for how it interacts with its workers Besides nearly 8,000 staff members, Kakira has almost as many contract workers in the shape of farmers, like Mwanja Banuli  To be able to sustain business you want agricultural farmers, plantation workers, you want factory workers and the vision of Muljibhai Mudhvani was to develop human resources, Barungi said  Before KORD I was just useless, said Beatrice Katende, who has received assistance from the body's programs In Uganda, sugar is big business This particular batch is headed for Kakira Sugar Limited one of the country's oldest and largest factories
