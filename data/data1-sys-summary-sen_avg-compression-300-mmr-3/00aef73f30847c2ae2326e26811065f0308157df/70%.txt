Workers next to the spot where subway trains will one day emerge from the tunnel  We will connect two continents, Asia and Europe, said Nusret Ilbay, one of the many engineers working on the $3 billion Marmaray Tunnel Project  A concrete wall is all that holds back a churning river of sea water Legend has it, thousands of years ago Jason and the Argonauts narrowly escaped death sailing up the Bosphorus in search of the mythological Golden Fleece Today, engineers face equally daunting challenges building a tunnel beneath one of the world's busiest shipping channels, at depths of up to 55 meters, in an active earthquake zone First they dredged a trench on the bottom of the Bosphorus To enter the unfinished tunnel, visitors must climb down a steep staircase in a construction tower surrounded by water in the middle of the strait In Yenikapi, a neighborhood of textile factories and seedy hotels where one of the main transit stations for Istanbul's new subway and commuter rail system was to be built, archaeologists discovered the lost Byzantine port of Theodosius  Until its rediscovery in 2004, archaeologists said they only knew about the port from ancient books  At around one meter below sea level, we started finding the remains of ropes In one tent, two workers carefully uncover the ancient wooden beams of a 40-meter long merchant vessel  Pulak says that marked a revolutionary change which transformed shipbuilding from mostly an art form to a science  Too bad traffic often moves at a snail's pace  It is the beginning of engineering  Ships could be preconceived and pre-designed  The first man, about 8,400 years ago, came and started to settle here, Yilmaz said Plans to travel beneath the Bosphorus have been delayed at least four years by the excavation of the Theodosious Port  Istanbul is a dynamically changing city, every year increasing in population, says Zeynep Buket, an engineer working with Turkey's transportation ministry The radical system city planners embarked on five years ago involved construction of a new subway tunnel beneath the Bosphorus Strait, the spectacular body of water that cuts this city in two
