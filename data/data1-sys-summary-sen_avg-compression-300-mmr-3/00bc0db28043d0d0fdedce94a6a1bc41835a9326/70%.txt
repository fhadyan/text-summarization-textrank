History has little noted, nor has it long remembered, more than a handful of them  Harding  Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it Theodore Roosevelt failed  Dwight Eisenhower failed Why do inaugural addresses fail? They fail for two reasons: One subject to the speaker's control; the other, not They fail, first, because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric, even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments  Grand language wrapped around a thin message produces only vapid blather Consider, for example, this passage from Obama's first inaugural address:  We remain a young nation  The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history   Good writing can never come from bad thinking Zelizer: Learning from Lincoln, Wilson, FDR But there's another source of failure, one not so easily corrected  No doubt this great change has caused serious disturbance to our Southern communities Garfield was assassinated in September 1881, serving barely six months in office  Even had Garfield served a full term, his efforts would almost certainly have failed  We continue to quote a single sentence from Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural, a sentence from Ronald Reagan's first and a two-word phrase from Lyndon Johnson's Federal enforcement of the voting rights of Southern blacks; federal funding of equal education for black children to become reality, these aspirations of Garfield's required support from courts, Congress and public opinion  Garfield's noble summons went unheeded at the time and therefore inspires little interest now  Even a good president can deliver a bad speech
