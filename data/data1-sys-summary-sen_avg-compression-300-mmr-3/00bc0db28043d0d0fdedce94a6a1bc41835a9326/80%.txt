History has little noted, nor has it long remembered, more than a handful of them Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it Why do inaugural addresses fail? They fail, first, because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric, even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments  Grand language wrapped around a thin message produces only vapid blather Consider, for example, this passage from Obama's first inaugural address:  The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history   Good writing can never come from bad thinking But there's another source of failure, one not so easily corrected Garfield was assassinated in September 1881, serving barely six months in office  Even had Garfield served a full term, his efforts would almost certainly have failed  We continue to quote a single sentence from Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural, a sentence from Ronald Reagan's first and a two-word phrase from Lyndon Johnson's  Even a good president can deliver a bad speech
