Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it Theodore Roosevelt failed Why do inaugural addresses fail? They fail, first, because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric, even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments  Grand language wrapped around a thin message produces only vapid blather  The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history  But there's another source of failure, one not so easily corrected Garfield was assassinated in September 1881, serving barely six months in office  We continue to quote a single sentence from Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural, a sentence from Ronald Reagan's first and a two-word phrase from Lyndon Johnson's  Even a good president can deliver a bad speech
