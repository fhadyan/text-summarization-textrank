 Ferguson is crumbling First and foremost, our police departments must better reflect the diverse demographics of our increasingly diverse nation, whether it be race, creed, sexual orientation and more  America is changing fast, but police departments aren't keeping up Second, we must radically rethink the trend toward the indiscriminate procurement and use of surplus military grade weaponry, which under the Department of Defense's 1033 program is flowing from battlefields to our local police forces  It's that simple  Yet until such a bill is passed, war weapons will continue to flood our streets; Congress must act to stem this tide Residents understandably want justice  But what's worse in all this is that Ferguson is illustrative of a broader problem across the country as increasingly militarized majority-white police departments demonstrate consistent racial bias toward majority-black communities
