 Or perhaps not  Maybe even starting today I'm talking about breaking the habit of faking knowledge in order to save face For every time someone reassured us, There's no such thing as a stupid question, weren't there ample experiences on the playground, at the dinner table, and yes, in the classroom that convinced us otherwise?  We'll go to great lengths to avoid it, often without deliberate thought Lately it seems we've been inundated with bad news: The nation's report card is crummy; schools are broke and failing; graduates can't find jobs  Politicians routinely face shame if they confess to not knowing  Such behavior is apparently endemic  And with competition for resources putting increased pressure on standardized test scores, cheating scandals have become practically ho-hum Her students, anxious to deliver the right answer, would demand clarification  You decide  But we won't ever achieve equity let alone excellence if we don't also work to make our schools places where we all feel safe saying I don't know  Pressure to know the right answer (or, more precisely, to appear to know) isn't limited to the classroom  Daunting because it means real reform will require more widespread change
