 Maybe even starting today I'm talking about breaking the habit of faking knowledge in order to save face  Such behavior is apparently endemic  And with competition for resources putting increased pressure on standardized test scores, cheating scandals have become practically ho-hum Her students, anxious to deliver the right answer, would demand clarification  But we won't ever achieve equity let alone excellence if we don't also work to make our schools places where we all feel safe saying I don't know  Pressure to know the right answer (or, more precisely, to appear to know) isn't limited to the classroom
