 Maybe even starting today I'm talking about breaking the habit of faking knowledge in order to save face For every time someone reassured us, There's no such thing as a stupid question, weren't there ample experiences on the playground, at the dinner table, and yes, in the classroom that convinced us otherwise?  We'll go to great lengths to avoid it, often without deliberate thought How many times have I found myself nodding in feigned recognition when someone makes reference to a person or book they assume I know? How many times have I been guilty of unwittingly inflicting similar discomfort on others? Lately it seems we've been inundated with bad news: The nation's report card is crummy; schools are broke and failing; graduates can't find jobs  Politicians routinely face shame if they confess to not knowing Remember Rick Perry's memory lapse during the 2011 Republican primary debate? It seems we'll forgive our elected officials just about any breach of ethics, but let them admit to anything less than invulnerable certainty and they can kiss our vote goodbye  Such behavior is apparently endemic  And with competition for resources putting increased pressure on standardized test scores, cheating scandals have become practically ho-hum  She'd have them read one of the plays, then ask: Who's more powerful in this scene?  Her students, anxious to deliver the right answer, would demand clarification Lori would shrug and unfurl her fingers: Nothing up my sleeves  But we won't ever achieve equity let alone excellence if we don't also work to make our schools places where we all feel safe saying I don't know  Pressure to know the right answer (or, more precisely, to appear to know) isn't limited to the classroom  Daunting because it means real reform will require more widespread change
