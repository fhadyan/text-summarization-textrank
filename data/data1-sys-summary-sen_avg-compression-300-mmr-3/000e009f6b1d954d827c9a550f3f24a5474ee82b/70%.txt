 Kyle White now has two pieces of metal to wear one, a bracelet inscribed with the names of his six comrades killed in an ambush in Afghanistan, the other, a Medal of Honor given to him for his valor that ensured that death toll wasn't higher Speaking minutes after President Barack Obama gave him the highest military honor, White insisted the two emblems are equally significant Attacked in 'ambush alley' On Tuesday, White dressed in full uniform  His service had, like many other members of the military, earned him a ticket to Afghanistan as his platoon's radio telephone operator In an interview prior to the award ceremony, White told CNN how the group walked down this little incline and looking into the valley, (when) I hear this single shot The former Army sergeant said Tuesday he owes it to these men, whom he calls my heroes, to live his life well, even now that he's left the military, and with honor  White administered first aid to one wounded soldier using the only cover available: a single tree  White ran toward him, braving enemy fire White was able to drag the wounded man back to the tree  White told the military publication Stars and Stripes that he could see the leader's helmet and assault pack, but he couldn't tell whether the leader was alive  White had to see, he said White crawled toward the man  He was dead White figured he would be killed Then White found a working radio on a deceased comrade and called for artillery and helicopter gunships to help  But then a friendly mortar round landed near White  And it hasn't entirely gone away, all these years later  It's something you still think about every day, White said  he told NPR White first returned home and trained other paratrooopers  He's the 10th recipient of that award for his actions in Afghanistan, and the seventh surviving recipient In a brief statement to reporters after Tuesday's ceremony, White called the Medal of Honor a symbol of the responsibility all soldiers knowingly face when they depart for distant lands in defense of the nation, a responsibility that locks us all in the bonds of brotherhood As such, White couldn't help but think about his brothers in arms  Without the team, he said, there could be no Medal of Honor Read the transcript of the White House ceremony 24 minority veterans receive long overdue Medal of Honor See Kyle White's Army profile
