Speaking minutes after President Barack Obama gave him the highest military honor, White insisted the two emblems are equally significant Attacked in 'ambush alley' On Tuesday, White dressed in full uniform  His service had, like many other members of the military, earned him a ticket to Afghanistan as his platoon's radio telephone operator  White administered first aid to one wounded soldier using the only cover available: a single tree  White ran toward him, braving enemy fire  White told the military publication Stars and Stripes that he could see the leader's helmet and assault pack, but he couldn't tell whether the leader was alive  White had to see, he said White crawled toward the man  He was dead White figured he would be killed Then White found a working radio on a deceased comrade and called for artillery and helicopter gunships to help  It's something you still think about every day, White said  he told NPR White first returned home and trained other paratrooopers  He's the 10th recipient of that award for his actions in Afghanistan, and the seventh surviving recipient  Without the team, he said, there could be no Medal of Honor Read the transcript of the White House ceremony See Kyle White's Army profile
