St Petersburg, Russia Most artistic directors' first day leading a new ballet company is all about meeting the dancers He approached Duato, a non-Russian speaker, who has spent the last 20 years choreographing new works as Artistic Director of the Spanish National Dance Company At first Duato was reluctant to change direction towards classical ballet  But then Mikhailovsky offered him the chance to bring modern choreography to a classical ballet company and it proved an offer too enticing to pass up Duato has set himself a challenging schedule, hand-picking three dancers to create a ballet so new it doesn't even have a name yet Duato believes ballet is a living organism, which needs to evolve constantly in order to keep the audience interested  Together we are going to work into something, said Duato  I think they have it pretty clear that they want to change; that they want something new  Russians love ballet
