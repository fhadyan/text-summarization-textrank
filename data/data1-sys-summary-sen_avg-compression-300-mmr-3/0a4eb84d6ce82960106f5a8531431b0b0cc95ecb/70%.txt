In real court, however, the rules are different  Huth's attorneys should have complied with these rules Cosby breaks his silence Huth filed her complaint long after the time permitted by the statute of limitations  By definition, they deny access to a substantive claim for a purely procedural reason While limitations periods are arbitrary, the public policy is not: defendants deserve protection of the law too  It makes sense that you should not have to be hauled into court tomorrow for a fender bender you got into with your 1977 AMC Gremlin in 1977  Limitations periods are more controversial in sexual assault cases because complainants sometimes children will repress memories, or fear coming forward Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules extending the time to file in cases of childhood sexual abuse First, when asserting claims based on alleged childhood sexual abuse, a plaintiff over the age of 26 has to file Certificates of Merit, documents executed by a licensed mental health practitioner attesting that the allegations have merit Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit Second, the rule provides some protection to would-be defendants and their privacy  Her attorneys filed her Complaint naming Cosby  At the mansion, Cosby allegedly forced her to perform a sex act on him  Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there Childhood sexual abuse is a detestable crime, and the injuries last a lifetime The court of public opinion will likely ignore these violations as technicalities, and continue to judge, and condemn Cosby  But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed Cosby and his attorneys are not going quietly into the good night
