 Can a movie actually convince you to support torture? Can a movie really persuade you that fracking a process used to drill for natural gas is a danger to the environment? Can a movie truly cause you to view certain minority groups in a negative light? Critics of Zero Dark Thirty fear that audiences will accept as true the film's story line that torture was effective in eliciting information to locate bin Laden Peter Bergen: Did torture really net bin Laden?  senators John McCain, Carl Levin and Dianne Feinstein sent a letter to the film's distributor, Sony Pictures, characterizing the film's use of torture as grossly inaccurate and misleading  Big business namely, the gas industry is aggressively objecting to the allegation in Promised Land that fracking poses environmental and health risks  They are wrong  Within hours of Krasinski's appearance, Energy in Depth posted a blog on its website pointing out what it perceived as factual errors made by Krasinski about fracking  They understand that accurate representations matter because studies have shown that biases can form based on stereotypes or inaccurate representations So go ahead, enjoy these films and ones like them that are based on actual events or current hot issues  You might also be getting a (mis)education  They present hot button issues that manage to fire up people from the left and right
