The December gang-rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi has stirred consciences in India in a way I have never before experienced: It has forced Indians to confront a terrible truth that for our girls and women, violence and discrimination are facts of daily life, an epidemic that, researchers say, claims nearly 2 million lives in India each year  Aggressive behavior toward women isn't innate Often it starts with something simple, like the laundry Ram eventually adopted a new outlook; that truly strong men don't show power, they show care Now I'm not saying men doing laundry is the solution Opinion: End global rape culture I got a taste of the challenge earlier this month, when officials from the Barabanki district in Uttar Pradesh, a state adjoining New Delhi, asked if I would lead a workshop promoting teen safety and gender sensitivity for the government schools  Another vowed to make gender equity a required part of parent-teacher conferences  A World Health Organization global survey found that 59% of women in rural Ethiopia report being subjected to sexual violence from their intimate partner, 62% of women in Peru report physical violence at the hands of their partners and 30% of women in rural Bangladesh say their first sexual experience was forced I was disappointed to see they had invited only the heads of girls' schools  I've seen how the deep inequalities between women and men trap millions of Indian families in cycle of poverty
