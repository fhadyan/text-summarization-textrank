 Facebook is expanding its Gift feature to include plastic gift cards that carry balances for multiple stores and restaurants Facebook launched its Gifts feature in September for physical goods like chocolate, shirts, flowers and wine, as well as virtual items like donations to charity, Uber credit and Netflix subscriptions  Facebook cards aren't compatible with existing mobile payment technology like NFC, QR codes or barcodes that allow people to pay for goods with their mobile phone The new product falls somewhere between store-specific cards and bank-issued open gift cards that can be used almost anywhere credit cards are accepted Gift cards are an easy workaround for people who don't have enough time or personal knowledge to pick out a specific gift
