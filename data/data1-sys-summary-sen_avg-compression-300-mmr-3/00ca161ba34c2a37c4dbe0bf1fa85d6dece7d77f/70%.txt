 The company has even shown a reassuring sensitivity to the civic and social obligations that come from running such a popular communication service  Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too But the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network We'll naturally make great use of Twitter and Facebook and all the other services, but it'd be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civic engagement  Smart inventors have already made cutting-edge technologies that let any site deliver messages with the same immediacy as Twitter or Facebook Today, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter That sounds absurd, but you can see advertisements today that essentially say Find us on Facebook at facebook com/AcmeWidgets!  Now, Facebook probably won't fade away entirely, like early networks such as Friendster  But those Facebook addresses are just like AOL keywords 10 years earlier  And it is conceivable that the organizations and companies who communicate on Facebook today may want to become more independent We already see governments and civic organizations using the Web as effectively as the best corporations and media  Because we'll have a web of independent but connected communications systems, just as the Internet was always designed to be So it was big news when Twitter was offline for 90 minutes Wednesday morning  Technology pundits promptly began hand-wringing the weaknesses of having a single point of failure to critical communications had been revealed again! Could we trust Twitter? Did this mean the Web couldn't help us fulfill our most basic obligations to those in need?
