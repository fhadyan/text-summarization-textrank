 Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too But the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network Fortunately there's good news  Smart inventors have already made cutting-edge technologies that let any site deliver messages with the same immediacy as Twitter or Facebook  Internet access at the time Today, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter That sounds absurd, but you can see advertisements today that essentially say Find us on Facebook at facebook com/AcmeWidgets!  Now, Facebook probably won't fade away entirely, like early networks such as Friendster  But those Facebook addresses are just like AOL keywords 10 years earlier We already see governments and civic organizations using the Web as effectively as the best corporations and media
