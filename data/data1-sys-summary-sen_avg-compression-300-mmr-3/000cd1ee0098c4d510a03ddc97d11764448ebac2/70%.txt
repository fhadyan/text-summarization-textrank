Kathmandu, Nepal A ferocious leopard may have killed 15 people in Nepal in a 15-month span, its latest victim a 4-year-old boy that the creature dragged away into the jungle to eat The head of boy was found in the forest a kilometer from his home Saturday morning, said Kamal Prasad Kharel, the police chief of the Baitadi district, an area about 600 kilometers (373 miles) west of Kathmandu  It could be the same leopard, he said  No adult male has been killed, Kharel said The police chief suspects that a single man-eating leopard is responsible for the deaths Maheshwor Dhakal, an ecologist at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation in Kathmandu, agreed that it is unusual to find more than one or two man-eating animals in one area  Since human blood has more salt than animal blood, once wild animals get the taste of salty blood they do not like other animals like deer, Dhakal said
