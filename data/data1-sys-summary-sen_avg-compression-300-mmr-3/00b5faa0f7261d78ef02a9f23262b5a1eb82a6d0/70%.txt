 An $800 billion economic stimulus plan  And a majority  system of government The Constitution was written 222 years ago by men who didn't trust government  Three million jobs  That's because members of Congress are elected by local constituencies and they are expected to represent local interests American politicians are independent political entrepreneurs  Health care reform One-party control didn't work any better for George W  Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 2006 But here's another dirty little secret of American government: it often does work Under the right conditions, barriers fall away and things get done, sometimes with amazing speed and efficiency  That sense of urgency certainly existed after 9/11, when Congress quickly passed the Patriot Act Getting anything big done in American government requires a sense of crisis  are always declaring crises a drug crisis, an education crisis, an environmental crisis If the public urgency is not authentic, however, opponents won't have much trouble stopping things from happening  Members of Congress who try to block President Obama's program may find themselves in political trouble When the people want something, they will get it, whether it's the death penalty or gun rights or lower taxes American government is not an efficient, well-oiled machine Obama won the biggest Democratic majority for president in 44 years  Even if it means a lot more spending and a lot more government  His party made big gains in Congress
