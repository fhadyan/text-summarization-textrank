BEIJING, China When Jimmy Wales visited the headquarters of Hudong Shortly after Wikipedia was launched in China in 2002, the country's Internet censors began to intermittently block access to both Chinese and English versions of the online encyclopedia with the longest ban lasting around three years In recent months, Wales has held a series of meetings with officials from the State Council Information Office, the government body charged with internet censorship in China, to establish a dialogue between the Wikipedia community and Chinese government What is a big concern for Wales is whether Wikipedia can compete with the country's two homegrown encyclopedia websites that emerged while Wikipedia was blocked: Hudong  1 search engine in China One challenge Wikipedia faces is it lacks the brand recognition in China that is otherwise nearly universal  Everyone knows Wikipedia if they are using the internet Wales said he is trying to mobilize the local Chinese Wikipedia community to spread more awareness about the online encyclopedia but otherwise has not outlined a specific strategy to beat its more entrenched domestic competitors 'No reason for China to use Wikipedia' com, the largest Chinese encyclopedia website 7 million registered users, according to its website  Baidu Baike has nearly 2 million entries; Chinese Wikipedia has just 280,000 and over 700 thousand members  English Wikipedia has more than 3 million articles and over 10 million volunteers Hudong com utilizes a range of social networking functions to attract Chinese internet users, including chat forums, fan groups, short messaging services and bulletin boards  Nearly 100 million Chinese netizens regularly visit online bulletin boards, according to research from China Internet Network Information Center  The entry barrier is really high on Wikipedia for Chinese users, said Pan Wales has refused to comply with Chinese censorship rules, which means certain pages containing sensitive information on both English and Chinese Wikipedia remain inaccessible However Pan said Hudong's content, in time, will improve if the Chinese government continues to gradually loosen its grip on the internet Wales also said Wikipedia's reemergence in China, albeit at times unreliable, is a sign that Beijing's web policy is changing  We are hopeful, said Wales  That is our dream actually S based Wikipedia yet it remains unclear whether Wikipedia has gained any share of the country's massive Internet readership
