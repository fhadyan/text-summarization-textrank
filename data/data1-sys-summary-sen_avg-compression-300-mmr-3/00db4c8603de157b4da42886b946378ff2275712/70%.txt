1 on the Richter Scale smashed into Mexico City killing 10,000 people and leaving parts of the city in ruins 0 magnitude earthquake that struck the Caribbean island in 2010 killing more than 230,000 people  There are times when you can't sleep and sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and make sure things aren't moving It's called the Grillo (the Spanish word for cricket) early warning system Mexico City's geographic location and geological makeup put it at particular risk from seismic activity Meira also hopes versions of the Grillo system could be introduced elsewhere in the world where earthquakes are a real risk like in Nepal, India, the West Coast of the U Missing education? The SASMEX facility came online in 1991 and reacts to data gathered by sensors placed near major fault lines along Mexico's Pacific coast Warning app Known as Grillo Active, the tiny orange devices contain a sensitive movement detector, microprocessor and a WiFi module to transmit a signal  Grillo are currently in talks with a major convenience store chain to locate the devices at between 500 and 1,000 of their stores around Mexico Such a wide spread will ensure more reliable and faster alerts Receivers dotted around five major cities, including Mexico City and Acapulco, will sound the alarm if they detect an earthquake  The real test of a good infrastructure is the density of sensors, Meira said  This is our plan in Mexico  And that system, which consists of 1,000 GPS sensors For now, however, this fledgling group's focus remains on Mexico The first small batch of Grillo boxes produced have been sold, although they haven't yet seen any action in the field Now, they await the next earthquake $50 alarm
