(Global Mail) The night Bob Hawke lost the Labor leadership 20-odd years ago, I was a tender recruit to the Canberra press gallery who found myself, fortuitously, marooned at the Prime Minister's office door whilst the Labor caucus was dispatching the occupant Australian FM Kevin Rudd resigns Never before had the Labor Party dumped a serving Prime Minister, yet Hawke's equanimity outwardly at least was striking Not so Kevin Rudd Gillard calls for Australian Labor Party leadership vote Their tactic has been to avoid having Rudd, unlike Keating, seen as an active seeker of his Prime Minister's job But Rudd had to be seen to be drafted by his party back into the Prime Minister's office  This conspiracy Gillard denies, but the enquiry, Rudd says, is another of those questions for others Hawker is now openly connected to the Rudd campaign's camp and helped advise Rudd that night Prompted and legitimized by the leaked video, by midnight Saturday Rudd was on Sky News, effectively sending to the Labor Party and Australians a revised CV that set down his qualifications for another shot at the Prime Minister's job Should Rudd force a ballot? I don't know exactly how this is going to be played out  Hawke gathered her up, telling her Don't cry, don't cry
