 Aggressive behavior toward women isn't innate Ram eventually adopted a new outlook; that truly strong men don't show power, they show care And so I kept thinking of Ram as I gathered with the group of 53 principals from boys and girls schools earlier this month  This was all necessary Opinion: End global rape culture I got a taste of the challenge earlier this month, when officials from the Barabanki district in Uttar Pradesh, a state adjoining New Delhi, asked if I would lead a workshop promoting teen safety and gender sensitivity for the government schools  Another vowed to make gender equity a required part of parent-teacher conferences  A World Health Organization global survey found that 59% of women in rural Ethiopia report being subjected to sexual violence from their intimate partner, 62% of women in Peru report physical violence at the hands of their partners and 30% of women in rural Bangladesh say their first sexual experience was forced  We can change  That starts by treating this moment not as some global airing of our dirty laundry but rather a national awakening to the reality that all of us girls and boys, women and men must do our part in cleaning it  I've seen how the deep inequalities between women and men trap millions of Indian families in cycle of poverty  But along the way, I've also met countless men who, given an opportunity, were willing to examine and improve their behavior towards the girls and women in their lives
