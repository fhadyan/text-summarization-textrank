1 on the Richter Scale smashed into Mexico City killing 10,000 people and leaving parts of the city in ruins 0 magnitude earthquake that struck the Caribbean island in 2010 killing more than 230,000 people It's called the Grillo (the Spanish word for cricket) early warning system When seismic activity is detected, the Grillo sounds a loud, flashing alarm Mexico City's geographic location and geological makeup put it at particular risk from seismic activity Meira also hopes versions of the Grillo system could be introduced elsewhere in the world where earthquakes are a real risk like in Nepal, India, the West Coast of the U Missing education? The SASMEX facility came online in 1991 and reacts to data gathered by sensors placed near major fault lines along Mexico's Pacific coast Warning app Known as Grillo Active, the tiny orange devices contain a sensitive movement detector, microprocessor and a WiFi module to transmit a signal  Grillo are currently in talks with a major convenience store chain to locate the devices at between 500 and 1,000 of their stores around Mexico Receivers dotted around five major cities, including Mexico City and Acapulco, will sound the alarm if they detect an earthquake  The real test of a good infrastructure is the density of sensors, Meira said  This is our plan in Mexico Japan remains the only nation in the world where the entire country is hooked up to an early warning facility  And that system, which consists of 1,000 GPS sensors For now, however, this fledgling group's focus remains on Mexico With roughly 21 million people living both formally and informally in and around Mexico City alone, that means many will not be aware the alarm is sounding until the ground begins shaking $50 alarm
