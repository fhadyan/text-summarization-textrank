Khaled AlKhamissi's novel Taxi, first published in 2006, has been translated into 10 languages  But the author wants to get back to writing fiction He said: Some journalists have said that about my book, but it's nonsense to say that one book or 10 books can change reading habits AlKhamissi said he dreams of an Egypt where taxi drivers could have the time and education to read his or any other book He said he was among the first Egyptian authors to write for young people  Twenty years ago there was nothing for 16, 17, 18-year-olds to read, said Towfik Towfik said that despite Egypt's revolution, he still fears the scenes in his book, first published in Arabic in 2009, could come true  I still think there's a danger my book could come true  My taxi drivers are among the 55% of the population living under the poverty line of $2 a day, said AlKhamissi
