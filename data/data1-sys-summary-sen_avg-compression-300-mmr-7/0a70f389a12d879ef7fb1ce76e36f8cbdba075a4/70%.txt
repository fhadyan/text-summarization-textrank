The 50-plus Oscar winner, producer and political activist George Clooney is apparently engaged to be married  He's a gifted, idiosyncratic, goes-his-own-way, irreverent kind of guy  In his films, he has played lost middle-aged men, lost in their careers, lost in neglected marriages, lost because of a lack of connection to something important Up in the Air, The Descendents, Michael Clayton, among others  Many of these men reshuffle their lives, readjust their principles or at least find some self knowledge they sorely lacked  Clooney's doing that middle-aged love choice  He's at a particularly pivotal age  Unlike a woman his age, Clooney can do the whole settling-down gambit at almost any age Middle age is an important time for reassessment and course correction  This is the real anchor of middle-aged love: It's time to stop fooling around  (Hint: watch for children) It might irk Clooney to be seen as so predictable
