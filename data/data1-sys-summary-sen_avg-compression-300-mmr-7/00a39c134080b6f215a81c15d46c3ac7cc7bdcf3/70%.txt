Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair  I would say that's the most common style error I see is bad hair You know people have excuses for bad shoes because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they're walking and walking and walking but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair  Because you know what? There's a hat, if your hair is really that bad that day  I like to think about cabinets  I like to put things away as much as possible  You know what I mean? And people just think that bad flowers are better than nothing, but I disagree with that  I think that nothing is way better than bad flowers  Like at a dinner party, I prefer no flowers usually to the flowers that people have on the table Mizrahi: It's gotten a lot quieter, my personal style  I used to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, and I don't know, I dress in a very particular way now and it's almost like clockwork Mizrahi: I don't know For five years, the New York fashion designer has been selling low-priced clothing and home furnishings at Target
