On Tuesday, White dressed in full uniform  White ran toward him, braving enemy fire  White had to see, he said White crawled toward the man  He was dead White figured he would be killed  It's something you still think about every day, White said  he told NPR White first returned home and trained other paratrooopers  Without the team, he said, there could be no Medal of Honor
