 Facebook is expanding its Gift feature to include plastic gift cards that carry balances for multiple stores and restaurants The cards only work at four stores for now: Target, Jamba Juice, Sephora and The Olive Garden  It also offered gift cards for specific vendors such as Starbucks and iTunes  Facebook cards aren't compatible with existing mobile payment technology like NFC, QR codes or barcodes that allow people to pay for goods with their mobile phone The new product falls somewhere between store-specific cards and bank-issued open gift cards that can be used almost anywhere credit cards are accepted Gift cards are an easy workaround for people who don't have enough time or personal knowledge to pick out a specific gift
