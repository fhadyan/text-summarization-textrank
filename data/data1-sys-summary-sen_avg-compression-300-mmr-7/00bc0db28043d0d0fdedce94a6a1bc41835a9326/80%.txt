 Harding  Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it Theodore Roosevelt failed  Dwight Eisenhower failed  Barack Obama failed the first time, and since second inaugural addresses are almost always even worse than firsts, it seems almost certain he'll fail again on Monday Why do inaugural addresses fail? They fail, first, because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric, even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments Consider, for example, this passage from Obama's first inaugural address:  Good writing can never come from bad thinking  Inaugural addresses can fail even when the ideas are clear, even when the writing is fine, if the addresses make commitments that the ensuing presidency cannot deliver  Garfield  Even had Garfield served a full term, his efforts would almost certainly have failed  We continue to quote a single sentence from Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural, a sentence from Ronald Reagan's first and a two-word phrase from Lyndon Johnson's  Even a good president can deliver a bad speech
