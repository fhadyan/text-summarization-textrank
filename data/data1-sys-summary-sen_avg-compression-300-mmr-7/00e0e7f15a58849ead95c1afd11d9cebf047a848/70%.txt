I'm talking about breaking the habit of faking knowledge in order to save face For every time someone reassured us, There's no such thing as a stupid question, weren't there ample experiences on the playground, at the dinner table, and yes, in the classroom that convinced us otherwise? How many times have I found myself nodding in feigned recognition when someone makes reference to a person or book they assume I know? How many times have I been guilty of unwittingly inflicting similar discomfort on others? Lately it seems we've been inundated with bad news: The nation's report card is crummy; schools are broke and failing; graduates can't find jobs  Politicians routinely face shame if they confess to not knowing For the past several years, I've made a conscious effort to be candid about the limits of my own knowledge  Often she'd assign Shakespeare as a way of getting students to think about power and status Her students, anxious to deliver the right answer, would demand clarification Lori would shrug and unfurl her fingers: Nothing up my sleeves  If her students protested, she'd say simply, That's all I know  You decide In other words, a whole generation of kids who've grown up with an emphasis on multiple choice testing, who've been taught that knowing the one right answer is more important than the process of inquiry, who've learned that admitting I don't know is a crime  But we won't ever achieve equity let alone excellence if we don't also work to make our schools places where we all feel safe saying I don't know  Pressure to know the right answer (or, more precisely, to appear to know) isn't limited to the classroom  Daunting because it means real reform will require more widespread change
