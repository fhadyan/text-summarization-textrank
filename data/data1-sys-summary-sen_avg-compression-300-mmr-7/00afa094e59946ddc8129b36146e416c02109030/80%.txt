Yangon, Myanmar When Burmese commuters have an accident they don't dial 911 or any ordinary emergency service From films to funerals Kyaw Thu's society relies on donations and an army of volunteers around 500 a day who do everything from carrying caskets to preparing bodies for burial Message to Burmese people: 'Please be united'  People are not following their speech  They say we love Aung San Suu Kyi, we love General Aung San but they're not following their policy  This is the problem with Burmese people He said the society has not been allowed to travel west to Rakhine State where Rohingya Muslims are alleged by human rights groups to be suffering systematic abuse amounting to ethnic cleansing  So we have no chance to go to the desperate people, Kyaw Thu said He said the pace of Myanmar's transformation, from a military state to thriving democracy at peace with ethnic rivalries, depends on the attitudes of ordinary people  Decades of military rule had produced bad attitudes, he said  At the time, it wasn't uncommon; poor families would often sneak out in the dead of night to bury their dead, he said And so began the Free Funeral Service Society, founded in collaboration with multi-award winning late Burmese writer and director Thukha, which now also provides a free library, education, medical, dental care and disaster relief
