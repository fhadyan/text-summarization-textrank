 Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too But the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network We'll naturally make great use of Twitter and Facebook and all the other services, but it'd be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civic engagement  Smart inventors have already made cutting-edge technologies that let any site deliver messages with the same immediacy as Twitter or Facebook Today, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter  In fact, many of us have allowed companies to become intermediaries to all our communications, whether it was AOL 10 years ago or Facebook today That sounds absurd, but you can see advertisements today that essentially say Find us on Facebook at facebook Now, Facebook probably won't fade away entirely, like early networks such as Friendster  But those Facebook addresses are just like AOL keywords 10 years earlier We already see governments and civic organizations using the Web as effectively as the best corporations and media
