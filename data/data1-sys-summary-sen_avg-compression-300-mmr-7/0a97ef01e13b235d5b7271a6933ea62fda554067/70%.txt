 More than half a million people a year flock to the Blue Mountains National Park, Australia's most accessible wilderness, to see its impressive peaks and ancient rainforest However, Randal Walker, chairman of Blue Mountains Tourism, argued that it is possible to develop sustainable tourism without damaging the natural beauty that visitors come to see Penelope Figgis, a government advisor on conservation and tourism, also believes the park has to develop  Although it looks gorgeous and beautiful it is a park under pressure there are a lot of vulnerable species in this national park, said Tara Cameron, a local teacher and President of Blue Mountains Conservation Society She said: Everybody is looking for how we can make national parks relevant into the future  The New South Wales government wanted to see how we could connect with nature but also at the same time stimulate regional economies through tourism activities related to nature conservation  I think national parks and nature is worth more than just being the new thing, the sort of new product, she said  Only eight percent is national park  Humans are doing very well we are looking after ourselves very well Its tourism strategy has attracted criticism for refusing to rule out development within the park
