In real court, however, the rules are different  Huth's attorneys should have complied with these rules Cosby breaks his silence Huth filed her complaint long after the time permitted by the statute of limitations Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules extending the time to file in cases of childhood sexual abuse Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit  Her attorneys filed her Complaint naming Cosby  Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there The court of public opinion will likely ignore these violations as technicalities, and continue to judge, and condemn Cosby  But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed Cosby and his attorneys are not going quietly into the good night
