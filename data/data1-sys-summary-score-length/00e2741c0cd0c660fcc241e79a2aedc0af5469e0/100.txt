Andrew Egerton Smith, chairman of the East Anglian Air Ambulance said: Having the Duke of Cambridge as one of our pilots is marvelous news as he brings much experience to the charity after his successful career as a search and rescue pilot It's the first time a royal who's in direct line to the throne has taken a civilian job  He regards his work with the RAF search and rescue force as having been an exceptional privilege and the Duke wanted to make his own contribution to the outstanding work of the air ambulance service
