Climate scientists have previously predicted the Arctic could lose almost all of its ice cover in the summer months by 2100  What we're seeing is a much more accelerated rate of change, especially in the past 40 years or so and that has clearly been traced by scientists to the impact of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions into the atmosphere  So, in the past one million years the peak of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere has been 280-290 parts per million (ppm We're now at 395 ppm and adding more every year The result has been a new documentary film, Chasing Ice, based on 36 time-lapse cameras looking at 16 different glaciers in locations in Alaska, Bolivia, Canada, France, Greenland, Iceland, Nepal, the Rocky Mountains and Switzerland
