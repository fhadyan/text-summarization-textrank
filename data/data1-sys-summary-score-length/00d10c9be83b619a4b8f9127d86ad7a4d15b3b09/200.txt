Super Bowl XLVIII started out bad for the Denver Broncos The second half started out bad for Denver, with Seattle's Percy Harvin running the opening kickoff back for a touchdown Just before the third quarter ended, Denver got onto the scoreboard when Manning threw a 14-yard pass to Demaryius Thomas Denver, led by the 37-year-old Manning, has the NFL's best offense, statistically, but never got moving Sunday Seattle romped 43-8 by playing a suffocating defense and taking advantage of four Denver turnovers, including two interceptions thrown by quarterback Peyton Manning, the NFL's most valuable player for the season Though the game didn't experience the blackout that hit last year's Super Bowl, fans in Los Angeles had their own visual blackout The game pitted pro football's best offense, Denver, against the best defense, Seattle, but the drama disappeared early at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey On the first play from scrimmage, a bad snap went sailing past Manning and landed in the end zone for a safety, giving Seattle a 2-0 lead without running a play
