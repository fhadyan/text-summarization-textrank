Washington President Barack Obama has approved the use of armed Predator drones in Libya, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday Remote Predator operators are now permitted to strike Gadhafi's defense missions, including air defense, missile and radar sites  Predator strikes are also authorized for civilian protection and can hit Gadhafi's troops, military installations and equipment in the field  He said he believed that the first flights were launched Thursday but were called back due to poor weather  The president has said that where we have some unique capabilities, he is willing to use those, Gates said Gates said the Predator drones offer a modest contribution to NATO efforts to support rebels fighting embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces there, though Gadhafi is not a specific target Unmanned aerial vehicles offer more precise targeting, because their low-flying capability allows for better visibility, particularly on targets now that have started to dig themselves into defensive positions, Gates said Vice Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen  James Cartwright said the added precision is necessary because forces loyal to Gadhafi nestle up in crowded areas to maximize civilian casualties
