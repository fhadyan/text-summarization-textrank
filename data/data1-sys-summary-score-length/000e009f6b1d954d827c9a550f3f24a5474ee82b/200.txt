 Kyle White now has two pieces of metal to wear one, a bracelet inscribed with the names of his six comrades killed in an ambush in Afghanistan, the other, a Medal of Honor given to him for his valor that ensured that death toll wasn't higher  White ran toward him, braving enemy fire  White told the military publication Stars and Stripes that he could see the leader's helmet and assault pack, but he couldn't tell whether the leader was alive  The soldier White had dragged to the tree earlier was hit again, this time in the knee, so the White wrapped his belt around the man's leg, creating a tourniquet  Four service members received the Medal of Honor all posthumously for actions in the war in Iraq, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society In a brief statement to reporters after Tuesday's ceremony, White called the Medal of Honor a symbol of the responsibility all soldiers knowingly face when they depart for distant lands in defense of the nation, a responsibility that locks us all in the bonds of brotherhood
