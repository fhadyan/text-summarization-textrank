Coral Gables, Florida Former President Bill Clinton on Saturday defended his family foundation's practice of taking money from foreign countries, arguing that while he doesn't agree with all of the policies of countries that contributed, he feels the foundation has done a lot more good than harm The Clinton Foundation admitted last month that a 2010 donation from the Algerian government was not properly approved under the guidelines the Obama administration put in place with the foundation when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009  And then let people make their judgments, Clinton said Clinton concluded his defense of the foundation, stating that he thinks organizations should bring people together across great divides, around things that they can agree on and find something to do to make peoples lives better At no point Saturday did any of the Clintons address the fact that Hillary Clinton exclusively used a private email account for the four years she served as America's top diplomat, a practice that skirted legal standards in place Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman are among the countries that donated to the Clinton Foundation
