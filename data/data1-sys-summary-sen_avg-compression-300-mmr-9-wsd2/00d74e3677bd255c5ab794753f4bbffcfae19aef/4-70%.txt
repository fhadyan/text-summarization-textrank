Comprehensive immigration reform.What's the most important piece of comprehensive immigration reform you never heard of? It's fixing the legal system so it works for the future for immigrants and the U.S. economy.Many Americans think reform is about the 11 million unauthorised immigrants already living in the United States.News: Possible compromise on immigration reform takes shape.The root cause: For less-skilled foreigners who want to come to work legally in the United States, there is no line no available visas.The two existing programs for low-skilled temporary workers are for seasonal labor only: farmhands, landscaping crews, summer and winter resort workers.But we do.And we're going to need them increasingly as the economy recovers.News: GOP needs to back immigration redevelopment, lawgiver say.In 1960, half of the native-born men in the labor force were high school dropouts happy to do physically demanding, low-skilled work.No, we don't need as many immigrant workers in a down economy and far fewer want to come to the U.S. when jobs are scarce.What's needed is to end illegal immigration by creating ways for needed workers to come legally creating worker visas and establishing a system that allows employers who can't find enough willing and able Americans to connect easily and quickly with lawful immigrants.Without it, there can be no successful immigration law enforcement.Even the best, most effective enforcement is no match for the dynamism of the U.S. economy.As long as there are jobs available, foreigners will want to come to work here.Finding a solution for the 11 million unauthorised immigrants already in the country addresses the mistakes of the past but fixes nothing going forward.The only way to prevent this: a legal immigration system that works.
