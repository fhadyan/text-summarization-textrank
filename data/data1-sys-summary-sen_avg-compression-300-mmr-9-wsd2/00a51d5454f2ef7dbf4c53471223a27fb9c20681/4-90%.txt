Marco Rubio is all in.Rubio favors smaller government, while Latino are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rouse Republican voters.Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
