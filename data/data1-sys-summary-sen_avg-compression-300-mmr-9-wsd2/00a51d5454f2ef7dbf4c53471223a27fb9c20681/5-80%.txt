Marco Rubio is all in.Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favor by Hispanic.But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stick in the past.Immigration and Cuba policy away, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.Rubio favors smaller government, while Latino are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.And though Rubio question that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has mark that Latino view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue.Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.Another Rubio weakness is how-do-you-do want of bold policy proposals.By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the project of rouse Republican voters.Instead, Rubio has embrace a typical conservative approach to immigration.
