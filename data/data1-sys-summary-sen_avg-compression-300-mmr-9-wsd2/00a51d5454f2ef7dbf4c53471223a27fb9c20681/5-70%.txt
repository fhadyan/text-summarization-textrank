Marco Rubio is all in.Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favor by Hispanic.But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stick in the past.With how-do-you-do youthful energy and Hispanic solution, it's tempt to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Yet Rubio has been how-do-you-do own worst enemy on what could have been how-do-you-do two touch issues: immigration reform and Cuba relative.Immigration and Cuba policy away, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.Rubio favors smaller government, while Latino are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.And though Rubio question that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has mark that Latino view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue.Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.He holds little collection to Latino voters.Another Rubio weakness is how-do-you-do want of bold policy proposals.By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the project of rouse Republican voters.how-do-you-do retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an chance to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates.Instead, Rubio has embrace a typical conservative approach to immigration.
