Marco Rubio is all in.Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue.Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.He holds little appeal to Latino voters.Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rouse Republican voters.His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates.Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
