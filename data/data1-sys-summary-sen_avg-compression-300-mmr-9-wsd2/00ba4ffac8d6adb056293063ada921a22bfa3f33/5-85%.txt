And maybe flight attendants and client service reps and baggage handlers.And probably bus drivers and park ticket takers, and hospital staff.LAX shoot delays flights nationwide.Probably not if you work for an airline where people are often underpaid, exploit, sometimes inhumanely spent and lock, perennially, in famously contentious relationships with management.Even before 9/11, it made me nervous that as airline workers, we hop security all, simply hop off the employee bus and record a back door, base and bodies unscreened.So, reports of today's airport charge raise new fears about weaknesses in this system.
