It would simply be about protecting people from something that is everywhere in America: gun violence yes, at airports, and also at schools, at movie theaters, and malls.And maybe flight attendants and customer service reps and baggage handlers.And probably bus drivers and park ticket takers, and hospital staff.LAX shooting delays flights nationwide.Probably not if you work for an airline where people are often underpaid, exploit, sometimes inhumanely exhausted and locked, perennially, in famously contentious relationships with management.Even before 9/11, it made me nervous that as airline workers, we skipped security entirely, simply hopping off the employee bus and entering a back door, bags and bodies unscreened.When we finally got back onboard, our work now included air marshall, armed pilots, martial arts lessons, tasers, arm cockpit doors, and a new focus on vigilance, not warmth and customer service.Of course, I was wrong, and thankfully employees' bags are now screened, but giving guns to airline and airport workers is still a disquieting idea.Chaos, terror unfold inside LAX Terminal 3.So, reports of today's airport shooting raise new fears about weaknesses in this system.No way.
