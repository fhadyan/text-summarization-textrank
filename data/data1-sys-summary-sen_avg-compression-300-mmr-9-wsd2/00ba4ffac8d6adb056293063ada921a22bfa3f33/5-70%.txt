It would simply be about protect people from something that is everywhere in America: gun violence yes, at airports, and also at schools, at movie house, and malls.And maybe flight attendants and client service reps and baggage handlers.And probably bus drivers and park ticket takers, and hospital staff.LAX shoot delays flights nationwide.Probably not if you work for an airline where people are often underpaid, exploit, sometimes inhumanely spent and lock, perennially, in famously contentious relationships with management.Even before 9/11, it made me nervous that as airline workers, we hop security all, simply hop off the employee bus and record a back door, base and bodies unscreened.When we finally got back onboard, our work now included air marshall, arm pilots, martial arts lessons, tasers, arm cockpit doors, and a new direction on vigilance, not warmth and client service.Of course, I was wrong, and thankfully employees' bags are now screen, but giving guns to airline and airport workers is still a disquieting idea.Chaos, terror unfold inside LAX Terminal 3.So, reports of today's airport charge raise new fears about weaknesses in this system.No way.
