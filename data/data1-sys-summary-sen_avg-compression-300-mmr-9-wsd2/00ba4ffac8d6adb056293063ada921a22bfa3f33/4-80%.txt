And maybe flight attendants and customer service reps and baggage handlers.LAX shooting delays flights nationwide.Probably not if you work for an airline where people are often underpaid, exploit, sometimes inhumanely exhausted and locked, perennially, in famously contentious relationships with management.Even before 9/11, it made me nervous that as airline workers, we skipped security entirely, simply hopping off the employee bus and entering a back door, bags and bodies unscreened.When we finally got back onboard, our work now included air marshall, armed pilots, martial arts lessons, tasers, arm cockpit doors, and a new focus on vigilance, not warmth and customer service.Chaos, terror unfold inside LAX Terminal 3.So, reports of today's airport shooting raise new fears about weaknesses in this system.No way.
