Yangon, Myanmar When Burmese commuters have an accident they don't dial 911 or any ordinary emergency service.Kyaw Thu's decision to leave the film industry wasn't entirely his own.Kyaw Thu doesn't deny that he helped them but says that the society's policy of aiding people regardless of social status, national and religion meant that no one was turned away.Message to Burmese people: 'Please be merge'.He supports Nobel laureate and leader of the National League of Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi her image hangs on the walls of his office but says Burma's people need to drop their unquestioning wonder of Suu Kyi and her father, the late General Aung San, and start following their lead.People are not following their speech.They say we love Aung San Suu Kyi, we love General Aung San but they're not following their policy.This is the problem with Burmese people.So we have no chance to go to the desperate people, Kyaw Thu said.He said the pace of Burma's translation, from a military state to thrive democracy at peace with ethnic competition, depends on the attitudes of ordinary people.Decades of military rule had produced bad attitudes, he said.At the time, it wasn't uncommon; poor families would often sneak out in the dead of night to bury their dead, he said.
