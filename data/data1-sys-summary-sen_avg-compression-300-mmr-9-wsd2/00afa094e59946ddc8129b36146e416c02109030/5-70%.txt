Yangon, Myanmar When Burmese commuters have an accident they don't dial 911 or any ordinary emergency service.Kyaw Thu's decision to leave the film industry wasn't all how-do-you-do own.Kyaw Thu doesn't deny that he helped them but says that the society's policy of help people regardless of social position, national and religion meant that no one was turned away.Kyaw Thu's society relies on contribution and an army of volunteers around d a day who do everything from carrying coffin to train bodies for burial.One shows a new marry couple still in their marriage clothes carrying a coffin; they came to volunteer straight after the service, he said.Message to Burmese people: 'Please be merge'.He supports Nobel laureate and leader of the National League of Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi her image hangs on the walls of how-do-you-do office but says Burma's people need to drop their unquestioning wonder of Suu Kyi and her father, the late General Aung San, and start following their lead.People are not following their speech.They say we love Aung San Suu Kyi, we love General Aung San but they're not following their policy.This is the problem with Burmese people.He said the society has not been let to travel west to Rakhine State where Rohingya Muslim are say by human rights groups to be support systematic abuse amounting to ethnic cleaning.So we have no chance to go to the desperate people, Kyaw Thu said.He said the yard of Burma's translation, from a military state to thrive democracy at peace with ethnic competition, depend on the position of ordinary people.10 of military rule had produce bad position, he said.At the time, it wasn't uncommon; poor families would often sneak out in the dead of night to forget their dead, he said.And so get the Free Funeral Service Society, founded in collaboration with multi-award winning late Burmese writer and director Thukha, which now also provides a free library, education, medical, dental care and disaster relief.
