Twitter has done an impressive job of growing to handle its enormous number of users, while keeping its service simple.Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too.But the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network.We'll naturally make great use of Twitter and Facebook and all the other services, but it'd be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civil engagement.Smart inventors have already made cutting-edge technologies that let any site deliver messages with the same instancy as Twitter or Facebook.Now the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions, media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as Twitter and Facebook.Ten years ago, otherwise-sensible companies were paying millions of dollars to America Online to buy AOL keywords.In fact, many of us have allowed companies to become go-between to all our communications, whether it was AOL 10 years ago or Facebook today.Today, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter.That sounds absurd, but you can see ad today that essentially say Find us on Facebook at facebook.com/AcmeWidgets! .Now, Facebook probably won't fade away entirely, like early networks such as Friendster.But those Facebook addresses are just like AOL keywords 10 years earlier.And it is conceivable that the organizations and companies who communicate on Facebook today may want to become more independent.We already see governments and civil organizations using the Web as effectively as the best corporations and media.
