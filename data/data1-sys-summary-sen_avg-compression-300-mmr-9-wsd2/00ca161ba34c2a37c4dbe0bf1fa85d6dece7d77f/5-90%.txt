Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too.But the network is bigger than any one site or any one social network.Today, the services make on top of that network have done a great job in enable communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter.That sounds absurd, but you can see ad today that basically say Find us on Facebook at facebook.Now, Facebook probably won't fade away all, like early networks such as Friendster.But those Facebook addresses are just like AOL keywords 10 years earlier.
