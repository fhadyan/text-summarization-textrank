The flight data and cockpit voice recorders from JetBlue Flight 191, which made an emergency landing this week, have been retrieved and will be analyzed, officials said Thursday.The National Transportation Safety Board will download the data Friday, said spokeswoman Kelly Nantel.The cockpit voice recorder captures two hours of data and the flight data recorder, which measures the plane's speed and altitude, contains 25 hours.Osbon, who was been charged with interfering with a flight crew, has not made a public statement.A court official said Osbon was still under care Thursday.But his mother said on Thursday that he would reject the label.He just did what he was paid to do, Jean Beatrice Dowd said of Jason Dowd.The incident has been earthshaking for us, too, she said.After the incident, the flight made the emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas.Osbon's stepmother said Thursday she has flown with him several times.Crew and passengers tame Osbon as he screamed and banged on the door so hard the first officer thought Osbon would come through, according to a federal criminal complaint filed Wednesday against Osbon.He loved to fly, a love which he got from his dad, Judy Osbon said in a statement.Her stepson was upbeat the last time they spoke, she said.The complaint says Osbon began making remarks during the flight that concerned the first officer, who is his co-pilot.When Osbon said 'we need to take a leap of faith the FO stated that he became very worried.
