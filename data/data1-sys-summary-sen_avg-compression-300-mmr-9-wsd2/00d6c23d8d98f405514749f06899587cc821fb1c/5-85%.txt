The trajectory management system part is very complicated.Either the trajectory was commandeer by a group with at least one professionally trained pilot_film among them or one of the pilot_films in control programmed the new off-route trajectory plan into the trajectory management system.In the case of trajectory 370, it would almost certainly have stay_on on autopilot, which would have dutifully followed the trajectory plan in the trajectory management system.That trajectory plan was quite possibly put_down for some mysterious reason by a trained pilot_film.
