The autopilot follows the course put into the trajectory management system by the pilot_film.The trajectory management system part is very complicated.I am a commercial pilot_film, and I have done some training on the Boeing 777. Even after a few hours of professional program_line I would have been unable to program the trajectory management system to overtop the autopilot_film to aviate the trajectory plan that Flight 370 reportedly aviate.Either the trajectory was commandeer by a group with at least one professionally trained pilot_film among them or one of the pilot_films in control programmed the new off-route trajectory plan into the trajectory management system.The latter would be far more probable.In the case of trajectory 370, it would almost certainly have stay_on on autopilot, which would have dutifully followed the trajectory plan in the trajectory management system.That trajectory plan was quite possibly put_down for some mysterious reason by a trained pilot_film.There are two ways the 777-200 could have vaporize on this way_of_life.
