The autopilot follows the course put into the flight management system by the pilots.The manual control part is easy.The flight management system part is very complicated.Either the flight was commandeer by a group with at least one professionally trained pilot among them or one of the pilots in control programmed the new off-route flight plan into the flight management system.The latter would be far more likely.In the case of Flight 370, it would almost certainly have remained on autopilot, which would have dutifully followed the flight plan in the flight management system.That flight plan was quite possibly entered for some mysterious reason by a trained pilot.
