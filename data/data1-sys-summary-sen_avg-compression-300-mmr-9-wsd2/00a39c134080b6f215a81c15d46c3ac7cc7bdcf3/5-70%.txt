Isaac Mizrahi: Well, you know what, I think it's all house.And I think that these days, as a way designer, it's almost like you represent a political party or something.Like women say, Oh, that's a brand name I associate with because I've worn it before.I love it.There's a movie called unzip about me that was a really successful movie.Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that.I don't really love travel.CNN: Say you're walking down the street.What's the most common style fault that you see in people?.Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair.I would say that's the most common style fault I see is bad hair.You know people have excuses for bad shoes because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they're walking and walking and walking but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair.Because you know what? There's a hat, if your hair is really that bad that day.What's the most common mistake people make there?.Mizrahi: You know what it is with people? I think people get lazy when it comes to being at home they leave things around.I like to think about cabinets.I like to put things away as much as possible.And people just think that bad prime are better than nothing, but I disagree with that.I think that nothing is way better than bad prime.Like at a dinner party, I prefer no prime usually to the prime that people have on the table.Mizrahi: It's gotten a lot quieter, my personal style.I used to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, and I don't know, I dress in a very particular way now and it's almost like clockwork.Mizrahi: I don't know.
