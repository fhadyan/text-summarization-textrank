I love it.Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that.Always.I don't really love travel.CNN: Say you're walking down the street.Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair.I would say that's the most common style fault I see is bad hair.You know people have excuses for bad shoes because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they're walking and walking and walking but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair.I think that nothing is way better than bad prime.Mizrahi: I don't know.
