When Lukas Hartmann, 29, signed up for 23andMe's at-home genetic testing service, there were no surprises in his results.The Food and Drug Administration on Monday ordered 23andMe to stop sales of its $99 home genetic testing kits, saying the Google-backed company has not proven the validity of its product.The FDA warned that customers who received inaccurate results could suffer from undue mental torture or undergo unnecessary medical procedures.It's one of the issues opponents to home genetic testing kits raise most often.Scientists have identified more than 2,000 single gene disorders, says Rebecca Nagy, president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.Testing for markers of risk spread across someone's genome is really only testing for the tip of the berg.It's not that the science behind (this kind of genetic testing) isn't good.Hartmann's genetic code showed two mutations that are linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, he says the site told him.The upside of these at-home genetic testing kits and 23andMe isn't the only company that sells them is that they've generated a lot of buzz about genetics, Nagy says.Giving this kind of information to someone unfamiliar with genetic testing's restriction could prove dangerous.Nagy recommends anyone who wants to do genetic testing first talk to a genetic counselor.Some people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy lose the ability to walk and suffer from serious disability, his results page read.Hartmann says he now believes he will not get limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, although he says there is a risk he could pass the genetic mutations onto his kids.Parents push for standardized screening of Jewish genetic diseases.Genetic testing can be a powerful tool.
