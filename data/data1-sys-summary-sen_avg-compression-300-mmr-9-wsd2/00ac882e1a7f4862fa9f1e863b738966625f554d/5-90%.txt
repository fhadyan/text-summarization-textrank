Price: Washington there any part between the followers of Jesus and the followers of John the Baptist?.Moss: One of the interesting things about the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist is that John doesn't place down how-do-you-do tools and follow Jesus after he baptise him.The Jewish how-do-you-dotorian Josephus reference John the Baptist in how-do-you-do book, The Jewish Antiquities.In the Gospel of Luke, one of Jesus' disciples says, Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught how-do-you-do disciples.
