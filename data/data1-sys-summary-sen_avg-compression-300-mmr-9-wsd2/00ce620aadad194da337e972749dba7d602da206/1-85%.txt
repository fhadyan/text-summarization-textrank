So we thought Asian kids did great in school.Think again.Whether due to bias or mere lack of interest, the professors in the study treated Asian and Indian students differently despite their reputation for academic achievement.Mentors and mentees are too often arbitrarily paired in the corporate world.But it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers in academia, the corporate world, public service, media, entertainment and the arts, whatever path talented young people might choose to recognize the subtle, unconscious biases that sometimes prevent Asians from achieving their true potential.But more surprising was the high level of racial bias against Asians and Indians professors were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these students.A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group.
