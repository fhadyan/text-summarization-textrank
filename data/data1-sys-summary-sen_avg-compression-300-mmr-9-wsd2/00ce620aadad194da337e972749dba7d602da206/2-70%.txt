So we thought Asian kids did great in school.Think again.I get it.Whether due to bias or mere lack of interest, the professors in the study treated Asian and Indian students differently despite their reputation for academic achievement.And this lack of mentorship while in school may lead to an achievement gap in the workplace.Disturbingly, I have heard thoughtful colleagues wonder aloud whether the underrepresentation of Asians in senior leadership roles is due to systemic, external factors that should be addressed with reform in the workplace, or whether it's Asians who are responsible for taking themselves out of the C-suite pipeline because they're just happy being the worker bees.Mentors and mentees are too often arbitrarily paired in the corporate world.But it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers in academia, the corporate world, public service, media, entertainment and the arts, whatever path talented young people might choose to recognize the subtle, unconscious biases that sometimes prevent Asians from achieving their true potential.Names that one can associate with a gender or race like Brad Anderson, Meredith Roberts, LaToya Brown, Juanita Martinez, Deepak Patel, Sonali Desai, Chang Wong, and Mei Chen were used.But more surprising was the high level of racial bias against Asians and Indians professors were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these students.One of the researchers noted, We see tremendous bias against Asian students and that's not something we expected.A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group.
