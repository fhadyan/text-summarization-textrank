Think again.Whether due to bias or mere lack of interest, the professors in the study treated Asian and Indian students differently despite their reputation for academic achievement.And this lack of mentorship while in school may lead to an achievement gap in the workplace.wise_man and mentees are too often at_random paired in the corporate world.But it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers in academe, the corporate world, public service, media, entertainment and the arts, whatever path talented young people might choose to recognize the subtle, unconscious biases that sometimes prevent Asians from achieving their true potential.Names that one can associate with a gender or race like Brad Anderson, Meredith Roberts, LaToya Brown, Juanita Martinez, Deepak Patel, Sonali Desai, Chang Wong, and Mei Chen were used.But more surprising was the high level of racial bias against Asians and Indians professors were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these students.A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group.
