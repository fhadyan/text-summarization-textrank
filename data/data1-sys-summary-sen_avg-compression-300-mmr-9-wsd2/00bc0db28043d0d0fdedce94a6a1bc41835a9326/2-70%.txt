The inaugural addresses of the presidents are, for the most part, a wasteland of howling rhetoric and dried-out inspiration.Theodore Roosevelt failed.Dwight Eisenhower failed.Barack Obama failed the first time, and since second inaugural addresses are almost always even worse than firsts, it seems almost certain he'll fail again on Monday.Why do inaugural addresses fail?.They fail for two reasons: One subject to the speaker's control; the other, not.They fail, first, because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric, even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments.Consider, for example, this passage from Obama's first inaugural address:.Lincoln's two inaugural addresses stand (of course) as the great exception.Good writing can never come from bad thinking.Inaugural addresses can fail even when the ideas are clear, even when the writing is fine, if the addresses make commitments that the result presidency cannot deliver.Franklin Roosevelt's addresses in 1933 and 1937 remain alive, as does the sonorous rhetoric of John F. Kennedy's address in 1961. We continue to quote a single sentence from Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural, a sentence from Ronald Reagan's first and a two-word phrase from Lyndon Johnson's.Those were the words of James A. Garfield.Even had Garfield served a full term, his efforts would almost certainly have failed.An inaugural address is a plan for what is to come.Even a good president can deliver a bad speech.A speech can fail all by itself.Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it.
