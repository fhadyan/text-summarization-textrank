Theodore Roosevelt failed.Dwight Eisenhower failed.Barack Obama failed the first time, and since second inaugural addresses are almost always even worse than firsts, it seems almost certain he'll fail again on Monday.Why do inaugural addresses fail?.They fail, first, because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric, even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments.Consider, for example, this passage from Obama's first inaugural address:.Lincoln's two inaugural addresses stand (of course) as the great exception.Good writing can never come from bad thinking.Inaugural addresses can fail even when the ideas are clear, even when the writing is fine, if the addresses make commitments that the result presidency cannot deliver.Even had Garfield served a full term, his efforts would almost certainly have failed.None would have been forthcoming.An inaugural address is a plan for what is to come.Even a good president can deliver a bad speech.Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it.
