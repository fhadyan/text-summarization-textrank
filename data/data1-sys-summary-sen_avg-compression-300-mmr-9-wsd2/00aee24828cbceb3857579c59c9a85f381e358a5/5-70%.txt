Clarksburg, West Virginia North Central West Virginia Airport self-praise quick check-ins, free, accessible parking and a convenient baggage title.But airport director Rick Rock said an economic benefit analysis said the facility contribute about $395 million into the local economy, So I definitely think there's no question that we need this airport.In plus to the $1 million based on passenger traffic, the Clarksburg airport got $30 million to lengthen its track in 1999 and another $1.6 million from the Obama administration's economic input bill in 2009. Local students get free flights to Washington for school trips as well, Rock said.It's special.But Coburn said at least five airports have used creative ways to keep the money course in and has handle to get support for a congressional investigation to find out how airports like North Central West Virginia can get so much money for so few passengers.In Kearney, Nebraska, residents get to take aerial tours of the city's Christmas lights for $15. In Altoona, Pennsylvania, residents got free 10-minute flights to hit the local field's goal of 10,000 passengers.
