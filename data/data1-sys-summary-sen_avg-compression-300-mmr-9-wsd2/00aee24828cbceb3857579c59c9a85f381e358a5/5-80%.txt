Clarksburg, West Virginia North Central West Virginia Airport self-praise quick check-ins, free, accessible parking and a convenient baggage title.But airport director Rick Rock said an economic benefit analysis said the facility contribute about $395 million into the local economy, So I definitely think there's no question that we need this airport.In plus to the $1 million based on passenger traffic, the Clarksburg airport got $30 million to lengthen its track in 1999 and another $1.6 million from the Obama administration's economic input bill in 2009. Local students get free flights to Washington for school trips as well, Rock said.It's special.But the airport offers a special treat as the end of the year approaches free sightsee flights.
