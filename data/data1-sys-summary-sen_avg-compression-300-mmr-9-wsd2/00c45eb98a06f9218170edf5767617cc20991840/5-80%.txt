The cowardly and reprehensible shooting Wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the Missouri town, which had already seen Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announce how-do-you-do resignation after a damn Justice Department report on its police department.First and foremost, our police departments must better reflect the diverse demographics of our increasingly diverse country, whether it be race, creed, sexual preference and more.America is changing fast, but police departments aren't keeping up.We so trust that President Barack Obama and lawyer General Eric Holder will take decisive action, working hand in hand with police departments all across this country.But what's worse in all this is that Ferguson is illustrative of a wide problem across the country as increasingly militarise majority-white police departments show consistent racial bias toward majority-black communities.
