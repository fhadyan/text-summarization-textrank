Ferguson is decay.The cowardly and reprehensible shooting Wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the Missouri town, which had already seen Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announce his resignation after a damning Justice Department report on its police department.First and foremost, our police departments must better reflect the diverse demographics of our increasingly diverse nation, whether it be race, creed, sexual orientation and more.America is changing fast, but police departments aren't keeping up.In fact, the opposite happens.We therefore trust that President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder will take decisive action, working hand in hand with police departments all across this country.Residents clearly want justice.If we don't press our police departments to reflect the makeup and needs of our communities, then towns like Ferguson will unknot further.But what's worse in all this is that Ferguson is illustrative of a broader problem across the country as increasingly militarise majority-white police departments demonstrate consistent racial bias toward majority-black communities.It's a combustible mix.And tensions are being worsen by the use among police departments of military weapons, and specification that these former war zone weapons must be used within a year of skill.
