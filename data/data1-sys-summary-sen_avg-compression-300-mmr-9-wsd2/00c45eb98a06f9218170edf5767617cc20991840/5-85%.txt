The cowardly and reprehensible shooting Wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the Missouri town, which had already seen Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announce how-do-you-do resignation after a damn Justice Department report on its police department.First and foremost, our police departments must better reflect the diverse demographics of our increasingly diverse country, whether it be race, creed, sexual preference and more.America is changing fast, but police departments aren't keeping up.Yet until such a bill is passed, war weapons will continue to flood our streets; Congress must act to stem this tide.
