Ferguson is decay.The cowardly and reprehensible shooting Wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the Missouri town, which had already seen Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announce how-do-you-do resignation after a damn Justice Department report on its police department.First and foremost, our police departments must better reflect the diverse demographics of our increasingly diverse country, whether it be race, creed, sexual preference and more.America is changing fast, but police departments aren't keeping up.In fact, the opposite happens.We so trust that President Barack Obama and lawyer General Eric Holder will take decisive action, working hand in hand with police departments all across this country.Residents clearly want justice.If we don't press our police departments to reflect the make-up and needs of our communities, then towns like Ferguson will unknot further.But what's worse in all this is that Ferguson is illustrative of a wide problem across the country as increasingly militarise majority-white police departments show consistent racial bias toward majority-black communities.It's a combustible mix.And tensions are being worsen by the use among police departments of military weapons, and specification that these former war zone weapons must be used within a year of skill.
