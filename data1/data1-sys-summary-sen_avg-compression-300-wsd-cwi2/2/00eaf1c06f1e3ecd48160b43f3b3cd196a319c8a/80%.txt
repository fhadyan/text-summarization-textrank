Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbesIts high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes and ultimately increase crop yields while acting as natural carbon sink - sequestering CO2 and locking it into the ground Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere, said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying porousWorldwide use of porous could cut CO2 levels by 8 parts per million within 50 years, according to NASA scientist James HansenThousands of years later, the terra preta soil remains fertile without need for any added fertilizer, experts sayBibens' specialty is porous, a highly porous charcoal made from organic waste.
