(Global Mail) The night Bob Hawke lost the Labor leadership 20-odd years ago, I was a tender recruit to the Canberra press gallery who found myself, fortuitously, marooned at the Prime Minister's office door whilst the Labor caucus was dispatching the occupantAustralian FM Kevin Rudd resignsNever before had the Labor Party dumped a serving Prime Minister, yet Hawke's equanimity outwardly at least was strikingHawke, the Labor Party and most Australians knew that Keating had Hawke lined up for the killNot so Kevin RuddIt has been an undeclared, subterranean campaign to reinstall Rudd in the Prime Minister's office one from which the candidate has, until now, been able to stay aloof Rudd has portrayed himself as busy and contented within the Cabinet under Julia GillardInvariably for Rudd, questions about the quality of the Labor Party leadership, the propriety of those who removed him from the Prime Minister's office or of who posted the now-infamous video of his rage on YouTube all are questions that should, he contends, be asked of othersAnd in the resulting public imagery, it is not Rudd who is seeking to return to the Prime Minister's office; rather it is a semi-reluctant Rudd who is being ferried along by a group of ministers, MPs and Labor fixers who believe the only way that Labor can win against Tony Abbott and the Coalition at the next election is for Rudd to resume the leadershipGillard calls for Australian Labor Party leadership voteTheir tactic has been to avoid having Rudd, unlike Keating, seen as an active seeker of his Prime Minister's jobBut Rudd had to be seen to be drafted by his party back into the Prime Minister's officeBecause the footage most likely had been retained in a Government archive, suspicion falls on the Prime Minister's office or somewhere nearby as HappyVegemiteKR's source This conspiracy Gillard denies, but the enquiry, Rudd says, is another of those questions for othersHawker is now openly connected to the Rudd campaign's camp and helped advise Rudd that nightPrompted and legitimized by the leaked video, by midnight Saturday Rudd was on Sky News, effectively sending to the Labor Party and Australians a revised CV that set down his qualifications for another shot at the Prime Minister's job And it was reinforced on Rudd's behalf on Monday morning when the former Queensland Labor Premier, Peter Beattie, publicly urged the Prime Minister to hold a leadership ballotShould Rudd force a ballot? I don't know exactly how this is going to be played outGillard, you would expect, knows that.
