 It would simply be about protecting people from something that is everywhere in America: gun violence yes, at airports, and also at schools, at movie theaters, and malls And maybe flight attendants and customer service reps and baggage handlersLAX shooting delays flights nationwideProbably not if you work for an airline where people are often underpaid, overworked, sometimes inhumanely exhausted and locked, perennially, in famously contentious relationships wairporth managementEven before 9/11, airport made me nervous that as airline workers, we skipped securairporty entirely, simply hopping off the employee bus and entering a back door, bags and bodies unscreened When we finally got back onboard, our workplace now included air marshals, armed pilots, martial arts lessons, tasers, fortified cockpairport doors, and a new focus on vigilance, not warmth and customer service Of course, I was wrong, and thankfully employees' bags are now screened, but giving guns to airline and airport workers is still a disquieting ideaI was never a fan of armed pilots, even in the nightmarish days after 9/11So, reports of today's airport shooting raise new fears about weaknesses in this systemNo way.
