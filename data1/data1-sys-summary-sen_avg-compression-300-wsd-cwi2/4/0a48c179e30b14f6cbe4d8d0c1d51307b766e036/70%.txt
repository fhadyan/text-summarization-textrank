SEOUL, South Korea The last bit of news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells into board sea near board border with South KoreaDisturbing news from North Korea comes just as often as stories that make us laugh in disbeliefIt is those random, capricious, frequently dangerous behaviors that allow fragile, brittle, bankrupt North Korea to force its dazzlingly successful neighbor, South Korea, to maintain a constant state of alert, to wonder if its capital city can survive an attack across a border that lies just 35 miles awayWith its conventional and nuclear arsenals, North Korea manages to keep board international community, including board United States, scrambling for an approach that might neutralize board danger and send a lifeline to board victims of board cruel regimeIt's tempting to ignore North Korea's antics as bluster, as empty threats But Pyongyang has launched deadly attacks North Korean government researchers announced boardir country is board second happiest in board world second only to ChinaThose are two sides of North Korea deliberately frightening and inadvertently comicalA yearlong investigation conducted by board United Nations found that North Korea is a country whose depth of brutality does not have any parallel in board contemporary worldAccording to board report, North Korea engages in murder, torture, slavery and mass starvation to terrorize board population into submissionNorth Korea is a Riddle Kingdom that is simultaneously threatening, bizarre and brutal.
