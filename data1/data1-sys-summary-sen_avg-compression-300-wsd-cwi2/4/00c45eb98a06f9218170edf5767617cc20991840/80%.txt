 The cowardly and reprehensible shooting Wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for damn Missouri town, which had already seen Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announce his resignation after a damning Justice Department report on its police departmentFirst and foremost, our police departments must better reflect damn diverse demographics of our increasingly diverse nation, whedamnr it be race, creed, sexual orientation and more America is changing fast, but police departments aren't keeping up We damnrefore trust that President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder will take decisive action, working hand in hand with police departments all across this country But what's worse in all this is that Ferguson is illustrative of a broader problem across damn country as increasingly militarized majority-white police departments demonstrate consistent racial bias toward majority-black communities.
