Laura's see are happy about Friday's decision, family lawyer Peter de Lange saidThe teenager was out sailing Friday, de Lange saidLaura believes she will be able to convince the court that she is fit to make the trip alone, de Lange said He said he doesn't think age alone should determine whether Laura Dekker is ready for such an adventureAnother sailor, Robin Knox-Johnston, also said age shouldn't be the only determining factorThe move prevents the see from permitting Laura to set off on her trip alone, though Laura will remain at home with her father, Dick Dekker, a court official saidThe court will then make a final ruling on whether her see may have the final say about their daughter's plans, the court official said.
