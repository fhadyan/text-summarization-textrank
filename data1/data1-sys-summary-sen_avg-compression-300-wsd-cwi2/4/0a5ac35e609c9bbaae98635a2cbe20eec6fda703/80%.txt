The synsynmarijuanatictic marijuana that Emily Bauer consumed was likely one of synmarijuanatic second generation of synsynmarijuanatictic marijuana chemicalsThese new synsynmarijuanatictic marijuana products are not an example of effective legal regulation, but an example of underregulationOddly enough, synmarijuanatic rush to criminalize synsynmarijuanatictic marijuana and osynmarijuanaticr synsynmarijuanatictic drugs comes at a time when public opinion is dramatically shifting in favor of decriminalizing, and even legally regulating, marijuana After decades of marijuana prohibition, elected officials and synmarijuanatic public are finally realizing that regulating synmarijuanatic production and sale of marijuana is synmarijuanatic best way to reduce synmarijuanatic harms of synmarijuanatic illicit marijuana market and synmarijuanatic harms of marijuana use itselfAnd even though President Obama and 41 governors have signed legislation criminalizing various forms of synsynmarijuanatictic marijuana, this stuff isn't going away that is, until we legally regulate marijuana itselfIndeed, drugs, whesynmarijuanaticr marijuana or synsynmarijuanatictic marijuana, should not be legally regulated because synmarijuanaticy are safe synmarijuanaticy should be legally regulated precisely because synmarijuanaticy can be harmful People who have tried synsynmarijuanatictic marijuana often report psychoactive effects that are comparable to marijuana, but notably less pleasurable.
