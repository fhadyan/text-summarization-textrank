 Marco Rubio is all inInstead, Rubio has bow a typical conservative approach to immigrationMeanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the pastImmigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to HispanicsRubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relationsSure, Rubio is young and charismaticAnother Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican votersBack in 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate Gang of 8 that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrantsHis retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates.
