1 on the Richter Scale smashed into Mexico City killing 10,000 people and leaving parts of the city in ruins0 magnitude earthquake that struck the Caribbean island in 2010 killing more than 230,000 peopleIt's called the Grillo (the Spanish word for cricket) early warning systemWhen seismic activity is detected, the Grillo sounds a loud, flashing alarmMexico City's geographic location and geological makeup put it at particular risk from seismic activityMeira also hopes versions of the Grillo system could be introduced elsewhere in the world where earthquakes are a real risk like in Nepal, India, the West Coast of the UThe SASMEX facility came online in 1991 and reacts to data gathered by sensors placed near major fault lines along Mexico's Pacific coastThen there is the fact that only a handful of early warning systems like SASMEX exist anywhere in the world This means that Grillo will unlikely have government sourced data and advanced sensor system set up near major fault lines to tap into in many other locationsWarning app Grillo are currently in talks with a major convenience store chain to locate the devices at between 500 and 1,000 of their stores around MexicoReceivers dotted around five major cities, including Mexico City and Acapulco, will sound the alarm if they detect an earthquake The real test of a good infrastructure is the density of sensors, Meira said This is our plan in Mexico And that system, which consists of 1,000 GPS sensorsFor now, however, this fledgling group's focus remains on MexicoWith roughly 21 million people living both formally and informally in and around Mexico City alone, that means many will not be aware the alarm is sounding until the ground begins shaking$50 alarm.
