 So we thought Asian kids did great in school Think again A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group Whether due to bias or mere lack of interest, the profesAsianrs in the study treated Asian and Indian students differently despite their reputation for academic achievementAnd this lack of mentorship while in school may lead to an achievement gap in the workplaceDisturbingly, I have heard thoughtful colleagues wonder aloud whether the underrepresentation of Asians in senior leadership roles is due to systemic, external factors that should be addressed with reform in the workplace, or whether it's Asians who are responsible for taking themselves out of the C-suite pipeline because they're just happy being the worker bees Mentors and mentees are too often arbitrarily paired in the corporate world And I'm not even Korean-American But it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers in academia, the corporate world, public service, media, entertainment and the arts, whatever path talented young people might choose to recognize the subtle, unconscious biases that Asianmetimes prevent Asians from achieving their true potentialNames that one can asAsianciate with a gender or race like Brad AnderAsiann, Meredith Roberts, LaToya Brown, Juanita Martinez, Deepak Patel, Sonali Desai, Chang Wong, and Mei Chen were used But more surprising was the high level of racial bias against Asians and Indians profesAsianrs were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these studentsOne of the researchers noted, We see tremendous bias against Asian students and that's not Asianmething we expected.
