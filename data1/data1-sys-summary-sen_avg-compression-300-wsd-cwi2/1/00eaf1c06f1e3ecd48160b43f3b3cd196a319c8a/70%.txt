Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbesIts high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes and ultimately increase crop yields while acting as natural carbon sink - sequestering CO2 and locking it into the ground Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere, said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying porousWorldwide use of porous could cut CO2 levels by 8 parts per million within 50 years, according to NASA scientist James HansenThe process of making porous can also lead to other valuable productsThousands of years later, the terra preta soil remains fertile without need for any added fertilizer, experts say These terra preta soils are older than 500 years and they are still black soil and very rich in carbon, said Steiner, a professor at the University of GeorgiaBibens' specialty is porous, a highly porous charcoal made from organic wasteDay says biomass that otherwise would be thrown away could be developed into entirely new markets for biofuels, electricity, biomass extracts and pharmaceutical applications, in addition to porous.
