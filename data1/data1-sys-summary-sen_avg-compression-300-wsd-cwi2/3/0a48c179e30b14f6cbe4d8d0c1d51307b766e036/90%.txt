SEOUL, South Korea The last bit of news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells into board sea near board border with South KoreaDisturbing news from North Korea comes just as often as stories that make us laugh in disbelief But Pyongyang has launched deadly attacksThose are two sides of North Korea deliberately frightening and inadvertently comicalNorth Korea is a Riddle Kingdom that is simultaneously threatening, bizarre and brutal.
