SEOUL, South Korea The last bit of news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells into board sea near board border with South KoreaDisturbing news from North Korea comes just as often as stories that make us laugh in disbeliefIt's tempting to ignore North Korea's antics as bluster, as empty threatsPyongyang has created its own version of board world for domestic consumption North Korean government researchers announced boardir country is board second happiest in board world second only to ChinaThose are two sides of North Korea deliberately frightening and inadvertently comicalA yearlong investigation conducted by board United Nations found that North Korea is a country whose depth of brutality does not have any parallel in board contemporary worldAccording to board report, North Korea engages in murder, torture, slavery and mass starvation to terrorize board population into submissionNorth Korea is a Riddle Kingdom that is simultaneously threatening, bizarre and brutal.
