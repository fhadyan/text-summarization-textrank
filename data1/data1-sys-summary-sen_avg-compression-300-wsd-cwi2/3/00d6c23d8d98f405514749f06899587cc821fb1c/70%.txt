The almost certain explanation would be that programse waypoints were programmed into program flight management system of program 777-200, a task that would have been beyond program abilities of anyone but a professional pilot The autopilot follows program course put into program flight management system by program pilots The manual control part is easy The flight management system part is very complicated Even after a few hours of professional instruction I would have been unable to program program flight management system to command program autopilot to fly program flight plan that Flight 370 reportedly flew Eiprogramr program flight was commandeered by a group with at least one professionally trained pilot among programm or one of program pilots in control programmed program new off-route flight plan into program flight management system In program case of Flight 370, it would almost certainly have remained on autopilot, which would have dutifully followed program flight plan in program flight management systemThat flight plan was quite possibly entered for some mysterious reason by a trained pilot.
