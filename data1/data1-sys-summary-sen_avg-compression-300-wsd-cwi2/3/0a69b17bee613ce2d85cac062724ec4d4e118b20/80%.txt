Kamberg, South Africa Sunlight sparkles through the drops of water that tumble off the edge of the cliff Painted on the rock face behind the tiny waterfall are a pair of faded eland, the largest antelope in AfricaScattered throughout these mountains are some 60,000 individual images, visible at about 600 different sites The artists used the blood and fat of the eland as well as whitened clay, bird droppings and charcoal as pigments Behind them are two barely visible human figures We are all from the same originsThe tiny cave behind the waterfall is only one of thousands of such hidden, secret shelters in the Drakensberg-Ukahlamba Mountains of South Africa.
