A natural next step in the evolution of constraint-based grammar
formalisms from rewriting formalisms is to abstract fully away from the details
of the grammar mechanism--to express syntactic theories purely in terms of the
properties of the class of structures they license. By focusing on the
structural properties of languages rather than on mechanisms for generating or
checking structures that exhibit those properties, this model-theoretic
approach can offer simpler and significantly clearer expression of theories and can potentially provide a
uniform formalization, allowing disparate theories to be compared on
the basis of those properties. We discuss
