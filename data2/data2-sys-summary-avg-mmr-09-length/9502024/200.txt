 Table is the results of the robust parser on ATIS which we did not refer to before.  Hence, this parser is suitable for systems in real application areas.  Above examples show that people are used to write same meaningful sentences differently.  A general algorithm for least-errors recognition , proposed by G.  Finally, we make conclusion with future direction.  So, the bulk of written sentences are open to the extragrammaticality.  Figure shows how SCAN processes.  insertion-error hypothesis : Add (p, j, f, e+ ) to S(i+1) if possible.  The same jealousy can breed confusion, however, in the absence of any authorization bill this year.  Heuristics 2: fiducial nonterminal People often make mistakes in writing English.  They're active , generally , at night or on damp, cloudy days.  All refrigerators , whether they are defrosted manually or not , need to be cleaned.  All error values are additive.  Our robust parsing system is composed of two modules.  The other is a robust parser with the error recovery mechanism proposed herein.
