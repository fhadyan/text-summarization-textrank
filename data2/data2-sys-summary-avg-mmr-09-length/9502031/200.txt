 Two purposes are served here: checking the word is lexical (i.e.  This morphological lookup operates over a character trie which has been compressed into a (directed) graph.  Common endings are shared and category information is stored on the first unique transition.  Hence `co-operative' error processing.  If the word is unknown, the system reconsiders analysis from the point where it broke down with the added possibility of an error rule.  Under examination will be the number of errors missed/caught and wrongly/rightly corrected.  Different components and configurations of the system will be compared, for example the error rules v.  p.b.t s.  For comparison, a variety of other data has been collected.  Suggestions have been made to look for low frequency words in corpora and news/mail archives, and to the Longmans learner corpus (not native speakers   To investigate issues involved in shallow processing and cooperative error handling, the pet (processing errors in text) system is being built.  The focus is on these two issues; no attempt is being made to produce a complete product .
