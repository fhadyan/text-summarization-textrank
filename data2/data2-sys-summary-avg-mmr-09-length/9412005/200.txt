 In terms of hits, false alarms and misses, we have: Results are given in Table .  Clearly phonotactic constraints are useful, as both recall and accuracy improve.  Finally, we will try the current system on samples from other languages, to make sure this method generalizes appropriately.  These studies demonstrated infants' perceptive abilities without demonstrating the usefulness of infants' perceptions.  We imagine hypotheses represented as a string of ones and zeros.  For example, we sometimes use a self-delimiting representation for integers (as described in Li Vitnyi, pp.  74-75   For example (from an actual sample corresponds to the utterance, Want me to help baby marked with dots.  For example, boy was written as b7, bird as bRd and label as lebL.  Finally, before the samples were fed to the simulations, divisions between words (but not between sentences) were removed.  Each simulation was run on each sample, for a total of twelve DIST runs.  In contrast, the DIST simulations must determine the number of segmentation points to add using MDL evaluations.
