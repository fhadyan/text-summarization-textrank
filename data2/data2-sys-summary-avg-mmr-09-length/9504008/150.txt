 The morpheme-connectivity-matrix and phoneme-connectivity-matrix are encoded with the special Korean POS (part-of-speech) symbols and compressed.  The fact that the segmented speech performance is not much better than the continuous one (93.8% vs.  The n-best list [ word-graph [ and word-lattice [ ] techniques are mostly used in this purpose.  These changes include consonant and vowel assimilation, dissimilation, insertion, deletion, and contraction.  These signal characteristics make it difficult to directly use phonemes or syllables as sub-word recognition units.  From the resulting diphone sequences, the necessary phoneme lattice has to be constructed.  The central part of the morphological analysis lies in the dictionary construction.  In our dictionary, each phonetic transcription of single morpheme has a separate dictionary entry.  For single morpheme, the left and the right POS tags are always same.
