I call a finite sequence of attributes a path, and write for the set of paths.  ] ] ] [ By induction on the length of .  ] ] [ From propositions and .  ] ] ] ] Each resolved feature structure is a well-typed (see [ feature structure with output alphabet .  ] [ Suppose that and is a bijection from ordinal to .  ] ] [ From propositions and .  The Troll unifier is closed on these representations.  Thus, though is computationally expensive, Troll uses only during compilation, never during run time.  A signature provides the symbols from which to construct typed feature structures, and an interpretation gives those symbols meaning.
