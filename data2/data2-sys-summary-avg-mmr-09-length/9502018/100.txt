 This component was implemented as part of a discourse grammar for English.  John fell.  Mary pushed him t\tb.  And sometimes this ambiguity is unwarranted.  Mary was tired.  She was exhausted t\tb.  However, if a third sentence is added, an ambiguity results.  Consider the following possible continuations of pp: pp2 a.  Hannah opened the door t\tb.  A further ambiguity is that when the third sentence is past perfect, it may be a continuation of a preceding thread or the start of a new thread itself.
