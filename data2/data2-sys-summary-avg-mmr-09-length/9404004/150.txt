 Dependency grammar still recognizes constituents, but they are a defined rather than a basic concept.  The usual definition is that a constituent consists of any word plus all its dependents, their dependents, and so on recursively.  The third of these observations is the critical one: structures of the form are ruled out.  A second difficulty with dependency grammar comes from semantics.  Andrews ( ) points out that the same thing happens with verbs.  Dependency grammar can be salvaged from this mess by reinterpreting its claims about phrase structure.  Recall that in a dependency grammar, constituency is a defined concept.  If there are none, create the node anyway.  The fundamental relation in DG is between head and dependent.  It should not be surprising when separate theories of the same phenomena develop convergently.
