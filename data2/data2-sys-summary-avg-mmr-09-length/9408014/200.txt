 More specifically, we will say the translation relation between a source logical form and a target logical form holds if we have where B is a set of monolingual and bilingual meaning postulates, and S is a set of formulas characterizing the current context.  For example, the condition p5(x1) above might be proved from the input logical form, or it might need to be assumed.  Instead of feature based syntax trees and first-order logical forms we will adopt a simpler, monostratal representation that is more closely related to those found in dependency grammars (e.g.  rational debate.  In the following section we explain how the probabilities for these various processing stages are combined to select the most likely target word sequence.  We are thus interested in the conditional probability of Wt given As.  Taylor, Grover, and Briscoe 1989   language production in context.  We will refer to this probability as a `detail parameter   1992   The most common types of meaning postulates in R are those for restriction, hyponymy, and disjointness, expressed as follows: restriction; hyponymy; disjointness.
