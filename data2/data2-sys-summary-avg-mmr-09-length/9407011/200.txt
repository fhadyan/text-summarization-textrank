 Each obligation on the stack is represented as an obligation type paired with a content.  Weak Obligation: Don't interrupt user's turn 3.  Intended Speech Acts 4.  Weak Obl: Grounding (coordinate mutual beliefs) 5.  Similar considerations hold for the system responses 6 and 8.  This is then generated as 18-3.  However this architecture can handle varying degrees of initiative, while remaining responsive.  We have argued that obligations play an important role in accounting for the interactions in dialog.  Obligations do not replace the plan-based model, but augment it.  Rather, obligations are the result of rules by which an agent lives.  An action is obligatory if it is not permissible not to do it.  An action is forbidden if it is not permissible.  If an obligation is not satisfied, then this means that one of the rules must have been broken.  If an agent actually violates obligations as well then the agent can be held accountable.  This provides an elegant account in the simple case, but requires a strong assumption of co-operativeness.
