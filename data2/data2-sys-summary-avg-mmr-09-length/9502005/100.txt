 Bidirectionality of grammar is a research topic in natural language processing that is enjoying increasing attention .  Such a case is represented schematically in figure (see next page   The approach allows efficient bidirectional processing with similar generation and parsing times.  In this paper we adopt the latter theoretically more interesting perspective.  the generation analog of left recursion in parsing.  Three optimizations were especially helpful.  The third indexes lexical entries which is necessary to obtain constant-time lexical access.  However, despite these heuristic improvements, the problem of goal-directedness is not solved.
