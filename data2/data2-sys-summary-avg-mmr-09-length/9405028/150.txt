 , where SC and MC mean `subordinate clause' and `main clause' respectively.  However, in complex sentences, things are quite different.  Table.  Analysis for these cases is one of our future problem.  Constraints in Table.  This interpretation coincides with native's intuition.  This interpretation coincides with native's intuition.  Analysis of case in which a directional auxiliary verb i.e.  `yaru kureru' is used is left as the future problem.  Another candidate is the property sharing thoery .  Firstly we show garu's syntax.  Garu is the present form and its root form is gar.  Therefore inflections are as follows: gar-re,gar-i, etc.  Garu roughly means show a sign of or behave like ing .  Therefore an observer has a certain evidence to be convinced that that situation actually happens.
