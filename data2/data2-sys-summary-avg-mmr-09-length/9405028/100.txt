 However, in complex sentences, things are quite different.  Analysis for these cases is one of our future problem.  This interpretation coincides with native's intuition.  This interpretation coincides with native's intuition.  `yaru kureru' is used is left as the future problem.  Another candidate is the property sharing thoery .
