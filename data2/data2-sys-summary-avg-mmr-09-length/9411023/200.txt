 Abstract generation based on rhetorical structure extraction has four merits.  First, unlike conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems(e.g.  The anaphora-resolution and the topic-supplementation must also be realized in the analysis.  In text, various rhetorical patterns are used to clarify the principle of argument.  Among them, connective expressions, which state inter-sentence relationships, are the most significant.

Thus, the rhetorical structure for this text can be represented by a binary-tree as shown in Fig.  For example, expressions like 3 reasons.

In the case of the LeftNucleus relations, the situation is vice versa.  On the other hand, conventional knowledge or script-based abstract generation systems(e.g.  , each penalty score is calculated as shown in Fig.  In Fig.  As for the technical papers, they were 60% and 80 % respectively.
