 less significant bits.  This trial involved four subtrials.  The data is tabulated below, and it comes from the sentences in (   Performance results are given in Figure 8.  Notice that the interpretation of the shading in this figure is different from that in previous figures.  The results from trial 1 deserve special attention.  This is demonstrated in ( ,b   The program ensures that the same area of the search space is not re-explored by subsequent searches.  Observe that the value of d in the above solutions clusters around 0.66 and 0.87.  Similar clustering may be occurring with the ratio h/l.  A more thoroughgoing comparison of these two approaches to the problem needs to be undertaken.  The performance results were encouraging and demonstrate the promise of automated tone transcription.  This is illustrated in ( adapting Hyman's earlier notation .  a transcription   Next, the difference between the old and new evaluations is calculated.  Both the genetic and annealing search algorithms have been implemented in C   In this section, the performance of the two implementations is compared.  Three performance trials were undertaken.
