 This means that a resource-limited agent may do well on some tasks but not on others .  Figure illustrates different degrees of agreeing in a collaborative task, e.g.  We must also take cognitive costs into account.  Differences in performance between two strategies are plotted on the Y-axis against AWM parameter settings on the X-axis.  At high AWM the differences between the two strategies are small.  Hence apparently redundant information serves an important cognitive function.  Agents start with private beliefs about the furniture items they have and their colors.  Beliefs about which furniture items exist and how many points they are worth are mutual.  See figure .  The Attention/Working Memory model, AWM, is adapted from .  The actual locations are calculated modulo the memory size.  When agents have limited working memory, then only a limited number of items can be SALIENT, i.e.  if a belief is not salient it cannot be used in deliberation or means-end-reasoning.  Since other processes, e.g.  In 0-3 Bill rejects Kim's proposal and makes a counter-proposal.  In 1, the WARRANT IRU is in CAPS.
