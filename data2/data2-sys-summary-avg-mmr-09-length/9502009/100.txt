 When no SR has been acquired, the algorithm remains undecided.  Most of the results are very similar (differences are not statistically significative   It makes the association score prefer incorrect classes and jump on over-generalizations.  This scheme seems to present two problematic features (see for more details   comparing the conditional probabilities of c and given with the corresponding marginals.  Relative entropy, , could do this job.  Evaluation on NLP has been crucial to fostering research in particular areas.  The NLP tasks where SRs utility could be evaluated are diverse.
