 When no SR has been acquired, the algorithm remains undecided.  Most of the results are very similar (differences are not statistically significative   some cases are not classified) the two ratios slightly diverge (precision increases and recall diminishes   It makes the association score prefer incorrect classes and jump on over-generalizations.  This scheme seems to present two problematic features (see for more details   Table shows the cross-table formed by the conditional and marginal distributions in the case of and .  Different association measures use the information provided in the cross-table to different extents.  comparing the conditional probabilities of c and given with the corresponding marginals.  Relative entropy, , could do this job.  Evaluation on NLP has been crucial to fostering research in particular areas.  The NLP tasks where SRs utility could be evaluated are diverse.
