 which are generated.  We plan to follow up the current work by training and testing a suitable instantiation of our framework against manually annotated corpora.  In particular, the probability does not depend on the order in which the rules are applied.  On the basis of the usefulness of probabilistic context-free grammars , ch.  The paper is structured as follows.  Probabilities are assigned by the following inductive definition: P(NT1) = 1.  This can be done, and the method which we adopt has the merit of simplicity.
