 We have used our implementation to verify that no other outcomes are possible, since manual verification would be rather laborious.  Intuitively, this noun phrase may not take wider scope than the quantifier every candidate, on which its restriction depends.  This is more satisfactory, since it does not reduce the problem of proper quantifier scoping in the object language to the same problem in the metalanguage.

The association between and a meaning P is represented by the atomic formula , where is an otherwise uninterpreted binary predicate symbol.  In the following we will notate Q R S meaning more perspicuously as Q(z,Rz,Sz
