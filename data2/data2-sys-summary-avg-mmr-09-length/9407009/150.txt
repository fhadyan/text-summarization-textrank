 A major advantage is that components can be developed and tested independently.  There are several interesting conclusions to be drawn from the results presented above.  Work on the project began in June 1992.  The SLT system is described in detail in .  This corpus was unseen data for the present purposes.  The results seem however adequate to illustrate our basic point.  In actual fact, however, the error rate is (1 - 539/1001) = 0.462.  It is not immediately clear why these strong correlations exist.  Interestingly, this does not turn out to be true.  Intuitively, utterances which are hard to hear are also hard to understand and translate.  The ratio of error rates is 4.1.  The ratio of error rates is 4.4.  The ratio of error rates is 2.8.
