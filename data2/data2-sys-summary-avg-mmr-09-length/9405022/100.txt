 Until N[i] = N[i-1]4.  Until for some appropriate set metric (e.g.  N N(Smid 4.  Goto ; 6.  Hand-coded tree-cutting criteria.  Entropy is a measure of disorder.  The entropy S of that system is then If each state has equal probability, i.e.  This can be done using for example interval bisection.  This means that if we cut at a node corresponding to e.g.  an NP, i.e.  Until N[i] = N[i-1]4.
