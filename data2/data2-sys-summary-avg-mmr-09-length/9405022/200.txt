 Until N[i] = N[i-1]4.  Until for some appropriate set metric (e.g.  the size of the symmetric difference) and norm-like function (e.g.  N N(Smid 4.  Goto ; 6.  Also, banning recursion by category specialization, i.e.  Entropy is a measure of disorder.  The entropy S of that system is then If each state has equal probability, i.e.  Let the next word be wkand the previous word string w1 wk-1.  This corresponds exactly to the nodes in the and-or tree that exhibit high entropy values.  This can be done using for example interval bisection.  From this or-node we follow an arc labelled Id, or add a new one if there is none.  We have now reached a point of recursion and can index the corresponding subtree.  We will here describe three different ways of doing this, but there are many others.  This means that if we cut at a node corresponding to e.g.  an NP, i.e.  Until N[i] = N[i-1]4.
