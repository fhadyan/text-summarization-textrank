 Another approach is to limit the size of the categories that are being employed.  The resulting parse-forest grammar will be too general most of the times.  A practical variation can be conceived as follows.  sentences with unknown parts of unknown lengths .  A context-free grammar is represented as a definite-clause specification as follows.  FSA of course generalizes such word lattices.  Therefore, we are interested in methods that only generate a small subset of this; e.g.  A yes-no problem is undecidable (cf.  The following definition and example of a PCP are taken from [chapter 8.5   An instance of PCP consists of two lists, and of strings over some alphabet .  Furthermore, let and .  For an illustration, cf.  Furthermore let and .  Furthermore, there is a rule 3.  This FSA generates x
