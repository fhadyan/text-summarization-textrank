 Suppose the problem was decidable.  One example is the processing of an unknown sequence of words, e.g.  Another approach is to limit the size of the categories that are being employed.  The resulting parse-forest grammar will be too general most of the times.  A practical variation can be conceived as follows.  sentences with unknown parts of unknown lengths .  Furthermore the paper benefitted from remarks made by the anonymous ACL reviewers.  Thus the intersection of a FSA and a CFG is a CFG that exactly derives all parse-trees.  A context-free grammar is represented as a definite-clause specification as follows.  FSA of course generalizes such word lattices.  Therefore, we are interested in methods that only generate a small subset of this; e.g.  A yes-no problem is undecidable (cf.  The following definition and example of a PCP are taken from [chapter 8.5   An instance of PCP consists of two lists, and of strings over some alphabet .  Furthermore, let and .  For an illustration, cf.  Furthermore let and .  Furthermore, there is a rule 3.  This FSA generates x
