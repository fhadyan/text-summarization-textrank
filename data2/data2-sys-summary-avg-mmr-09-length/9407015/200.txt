 The intonation contour is indicated more formally using a version of Pierrehumbert's notation (cf.  The assignment of focus for the rheme of the response (i.e.  In this notation, L+H* and H* are different high pitch accents.  The inclusion of contrastive lexical stress shift increases the number of intonational possibilities even more, as exemplified in .  LH% (and its relative LH and L (and its relatives LL% and LL are rising and low boundaries respectively.  The research was supported in part by NSF grant nos.  R01-LM05217 from the National Library of Medicine.  CCG (Steedman [ is an extension of Categorial Grammar (CG   CCG extends this strictly context-free categorial base in two respects.  For example, the boundary L maps an H* pitch accent into an intermediate phrase rheme, p:rheme.  The LH$ boundary maps the same L+H* pitch accent into an utterance-level thematic phrase, written u:theme.  In example , capitals indicate stress and brackets informally indicate the intonational phrasing.  Q: I know which procedure is recommended for the simple hemothorax.
