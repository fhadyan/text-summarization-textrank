 The linguistic study of French intransitive motion verbs (see eg.  We distinguish 4 categories on the basis of which kind of location they intrinsically refer to.  When we enter some place or go out of some place, we have different spatial relation with the location (ie.  Such verbs do not behave all homogeneously.  We call these verbs change of position (CoPs) verbs.  Change of posture (CoPtu) verbs (s'asseoir-to sit down; se baisser-to bend down   (Talmy, 1983   Indeed, verbs like sortir intrinsically suggest a location of which we have gone out.  These concepts are: 1.  For reason of space we cannot detail our formalism here, but we intend to present it in the talk.  The semantics of a motion complex is not the simple addition of the semantics of its constituents.  This information is the result of the interaction of the verb sortir-to go out with the preposition dans-in/into.  We also address compositional semantics for motion complexes (ie.  (Asher, 1993   We continue our investigations on two directions: 1.
