 The linguistic study of French intransitive motion verbs (see eg.  We distinguish 4 categories on the basis of which kind of location they intrinsically refer to.  Such verbs do not behave all homogeneously.  (Talmy, 1983   Indeed, verbs like sortir intrinsically suggest a location of which we have gone out.  These concepts are: 1.  For reason of space we cannot detail our formalism here, but we intend to present it in the talk.  The semantics of a motion complex is not the simple addition of the semantics of its constituents.  This information is the result of the interaction of the verb sortir-to go out with the preposition dans-in/into.  We also address compositional semantics for motion complexes (ie.  (Asher, 1993   We continue our investigations on two directions: 1.
