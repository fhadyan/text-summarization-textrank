 We propose in this paper an algorithm that deals with both phenomena, in the same analyser.  5) Repeat (3) and (4 until all PPs and anaphors are treated.  The attachment of both PPs is then skipped.  Notice that even if each module is called several times, there is no redundancy in the processing.  The attachment module has been implemented at 99   Presently we are working on the extension of the anaphora module particularly to deal also with the anaphoric definite noun phrases.
