 2) Apply the PP attachment procedure.  We propose in this paper an algorithm that deals with both phenomena, in the same analyser.  5) Repeat (3) and (4 until all PPs and anaphors are treated.  - The pronoun its can not be resolved by the anaphora resolution module because it is preceded by unattached PPs ; its resolution is skipped.  The attachment of both PPs is then skipped.  Notice that even if each module is called several times, there is no redundancy in the processing.  These rules are applied to the conceptual representation and their output is a set of candidate antecedents.  The attachment module has been implemented at 99   Presently we are working on the extension of the anaphora module particularly to deal also with the anaphoric definite noun phrases.
