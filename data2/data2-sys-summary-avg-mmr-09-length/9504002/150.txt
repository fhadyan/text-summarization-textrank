 Note in passing that this may not as serious a problem as it first appears.  As a subsidiary issue, we will also look at how the tagger performs on unknown words, i.e.  ones not seen in the training data.  Some attention has been given to how to make such techniques effective; for example Cutting et al.  The changes to the tagset are listed below.  Swedish The changes made were entirely based on inflections.  D Definiteness: definite, indefinite.  C Case: nominative, genitive.  French The changes other than V were based on inflections.  G Gender: masculine, feminine.  N Number: all singular/plural distinctions removed.  The figures include the degree of ambiguity, that is, the number of words in the corpus for which more than one tag was hypothesised.
