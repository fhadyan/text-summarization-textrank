 The output from the net is a vector whose 2 elements, or nodes, represent correct" and incorrect yes" and no" - see Figure .  Then these constituents can be processed further.  Any link that is still disabled is activated and initialised to 0, so that tuples which have not occurred in the training corpus make no contribution to the classification task.  Now, in natural language negative correlations are an important source of information: the occurrence of some words or groups of words inhibit others from following.  Our working prototype indicates that the methods described here are worth developing, and that connectionist methods can be used to generalise from the training corpus to unseen text.  The pruning process is remarkably effective.  [ Still waters ] run deep.  (3.2)   (3.n+1)
