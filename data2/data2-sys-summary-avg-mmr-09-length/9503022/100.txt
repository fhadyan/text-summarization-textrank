 The outermost bracket is the root-node.  Begin Function , where Step 0.  S contains no formula , and 2.  ProofFrom , Proposition 5.4   The recognition problem of this unification grammar is decidable, because the regular grammar does not contain detours.  The reader should check that the feature-graph indeed conforms to the formulas of the applied rules.  First, S derives in a steps.  The reduction f is computable in linear time.  Hence 1) and 2) follow from fact .  Likewise, we speak of linear time, etcetera.
