 The boundary between morphology and syntax is fuzzy.  Instead, it is handled separately in a backtrackable fashion.  Thus, infinite loops when concatenating are avoided.  is obtained.  As such it is well suited as a linguistic theory for our enterprise.  argue against the use of two-level morphology because of linguistic considerations.  This is certainly linguistically appealing.  Surprisingly, they have not been widely applied in this domain up to now.  Morphs have a functor-argument structure along the lines of .  below   Reducing interface problems is therefore crucial to success.
