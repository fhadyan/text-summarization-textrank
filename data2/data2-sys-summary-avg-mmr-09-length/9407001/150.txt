 The boundary between morphology and syntax is fuzzy.  Instead, it is handled separately in a backtrackable fashion.  The central relation is the morphology predicate, (see Fig.  Thus, infinite loops when concatenating are avoided.  As a result of this constraint interaction the structure shown in Fig.  As such it is well suited as a linguistic theory for our enterprise.  argue against the use of two-level morphology because of linguistic considerations.  This is certainly linguistically appealing.  Surprisingly, they have not been widely applied in this domain up to now.  Morphs have a functor-argument structure along the lines of .  Others are triggered by a mixture of phonological and morphological facts.  below   However, these distinctions affect only how the applicability of a principle is specified.  Reducing interface problems is therefore crucial to success.
