 The boundary between morphology and syntax is fuzzy.  Instead, it is handled separately in a backtrackable fashion.  The central relation is the morphology predicate, (see Fig.  Thus, infinite loops when concatenating are avoided.  The lexical entries of these two morphs are given in Fig.  As a result of this constraint interaction the structure shown in Fig.  is obtained.  For applications this means that using a morphological component is made easy.  As such it is well suited as a linguistic theory for our enterprise.  HPSG differentiates between three strata PHON, SYNSEM and DTRS.  argue against the use of two-level morphology because of linguistic considerations.  Instead, they base their implementation on autosegmental phonology (cf.  This is certainly linguistically appealing.  Surprisingly, they have not been widely applied in this domain up to now.  Morphs have a functor-argument structure along the lines of .  Others are triggered by a mixture of phonological and morphological facts.  below   However, these distinctions affect only how the applicability of a principle is specified.  Reducing interface problems is therefore crucial to success.
