 In this section, we regard categories as polymorphic types and consider the type calculus.  We use greek letters, for type schemas.  The ordinary lambda-calculus requires a strict order of conversion.  If this abstraction occurs randomly, the process easily falls into a loop.  In order to avoid this, we assume the unification cost.  We can regard the whole sentence structure as more grammatical if the sum of these unification costs is smaller.  Two membranes can interact when they contact with the notation ` as .  As an example, we will take the sentence: Ken-wa Naomi-ni hon-wo yom-aseru.  The last DAG in Fig.  Then, the problematic final word aseru (causative arrives; its DAG representation is as in Fig.  The DAG in Fig.  Now, the process becomes as in Fig.  Thereafter we introduce the ChAM model and we reinterpret the model in terms of natural language processings.  All through the process in Fig.  However, because both of and unifies nominative case and agent role, the costs are equivalent.  The process is depicted in fig.
