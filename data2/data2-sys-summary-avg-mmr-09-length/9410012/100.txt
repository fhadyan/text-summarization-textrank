 The algorithm is again described by Cutting et al.  and by Sharman, and a mathematical justification for it can be found in Huang et al.  (1990   In the above example, 8 iterations were sufficient.  The results of the Xerox experiment appear very encouraging.  In the first place, Cutting et al.  The kind of biasing Cutting et al.  Other estimation formulae have been used in the past.  For an introduction to the algorithms, see Cutting et al.  (1992 or the lucid description by Sharman (1990
