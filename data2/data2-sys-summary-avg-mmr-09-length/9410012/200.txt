 The algorithm is again described by Cutting et al.  and by Sharman, and a mathematical justification for it can be found in Huang et al.  (1990   The first major use of HMMs for part of speech tagging was in CLAWS in the 1970s.  In the above example, 8 iterations were sufficient.  The results of the Xerox experiment appear very encouraging.  In the first place, Cutting et al.  The kind of biasing Cutting et al.  Other estimation formulae have been used in the past.  For an introduction to the algorithms, see Cutting et al.  For example, the LOB tagset used 134 tags, while the Penn treebank tagset has 48.  (1992 or the lucid description by Sharman (1990   T1 All transition probabilities have the same value.  In each case, the best accuracy (on ambiguous words, as usual) from the FB algorithm was noted.  Firstly, two of the tests, D2+T1 and D3+T1, give very poor performance.  Initial maximum Highest accuracy on the first iteration, and falling thereafter.
