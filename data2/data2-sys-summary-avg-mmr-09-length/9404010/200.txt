 For instance, the metavariable ` ' in the lexical entry for Bill is instantiated to the f-structure labeled g.  We now turn to an overview of our analysis of quantification (Dalrymple, Lamping, Pereira, and Saraswat 1993   Under that assignment, a NP meaning Qhas type that is, a function from a property, the scope of quantification, to a proposition.  It has exactly the form that the antecedent of every-man expects.  The meaning S will be instantiated to .  In particular, the quantified NP a unicorn will fill the requirement, as we now demonstrate.  This is possible because Al can map a proof of the meaning for s from the meaning for h into a meaning for s, simply by supplying to .  We have just seen how theorem ( ) provides a general mechanism for quantifying into intensional argument positions.  In our approach those problems are handled directly by the deductive apparatus without further stipulation.  We thank David Israel, Michael Moortgat and Stanley Peters for discussions on the subject of this paper.
