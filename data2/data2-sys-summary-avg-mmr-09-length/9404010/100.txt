 For instance, the metavariable ` ' in the lexical entry for Bill is instantiated to the f-structure labeled g.  It has exactly the form that the antecedent of every-man expects.  The meaning S will be instantiated to .  In particular, the quantified NP a unicorn will fill the requirement, as we now demonstrate.  We have just seen how theorem ( ) provides a general mechanism for quantifying into intensional argument positions.  In our approach those problems are handled directly by the deductive apparatus without further stipulation.
