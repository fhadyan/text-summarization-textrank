 However, there are exceptions, such as zbj bandit becoming zbje.  appeler, call becomes appellera   orth(zbj, [chngo=n   Then the partitionings given in Figure will be the only possible ones.  This is useful in checking over- and undergeneration.  For the lexical sequence cher+e for example, the output is as follows.  Surface: "chre" Lexical: "cher   The Features in a rule is a list of Feature=Value equations.  The allowed (finite) set of values of each feature must be prespecified.  Value may be atomic or it may be a boolean expression.  The same compiled forms are used for analysis and generation, but are indexed differently.  Reasonably quick compilation is required, and run-time speed need only be moderate.  We therefore take the following approach.
