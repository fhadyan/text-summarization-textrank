 Nonetheless, without this ability, the utility of synchronous TAGs is severely diminished.  First, however, we digress to discuss some notational issues.  We will use the following notational conventions for synchronous TAGs and related notions.  This assumption is highly suspect.  The doctor treats Jean's teeth.  The doctor treats his teeth.  John runs up the street.  This possibility, though tantalizing, remains to be explored.  It remains for future research to tune the exact requirements on the allowable mappings.  The possibility to interleave the computations of the phases does not make their definition any simpler.  Several aspects of this definition are noteworthy.  First, the derived tree pair for a derivation is .  Thus, in the grammar of Figure , the links in the auxiliary trees can never be operated on.
