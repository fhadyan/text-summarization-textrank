 See figure .  The extension we propose makes them more specific still.  The formal system of constraints and rules for centering, as we have interpreted them from , are as follows.  For each Un in : CONSTRAINTS 1.  There is precisely one Cb.  RULES 1.  In addition, languages that provide an identifiable topic function (e.g.  Each reference marker is contraindexed with expressions with which it cannot co-specify.  Indices for indefinites are generated from .  She drives too fast.  The centering model is based on the following assumptions.  Friedman races her on weekends.  She often beats her.  By a shift occurs whenever successive Cb's are not the same.  She considers two properties: SUBJ and IDENT.  The three filters in the filtering phase may be done in parallel.  The goal of the current algorithm design was conceptual clarity rather than efficiency.  Many of our informants have no strong preference as to the co-specification of the unstressed She in Un+4.  Speakers can avoid ambiguity by stressing a pronoun with respect to its phonological environment.
