 There is no linguistic justification.  So, these words can be use as discriminant of language.  They can't be omitted because they structure sentences and make them understandable.  The number of words to hold is quiet subjective.  These improvements haven't been implemented yet and will be the object of further works.  It requires to distinguish first, middles and last syllabs.  An interesting tool to build is a general document structure recognizer.  The realization simply implements the previous ideas.  If so, incremented their likelihood to be selected.  If so, incremented their likelihood to be selected.  This algorithm has a linear complexity in time.  The test-bed set has been prepared to process French, English, Spanish and German.  The results we obtained were expected.  From 1 to 3 words, there are mainly total undeterminations.  Here, sentences and grammatical words appear but in few quantities to allow a perfect deduction.  Methods described in must be implemented to improve results in this case.  For less than 8 words there are still ambiguities or total undetermination.
