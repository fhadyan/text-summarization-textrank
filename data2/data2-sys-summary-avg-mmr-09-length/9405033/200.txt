 Tomabechi, 1991) in systems using lexicalist grammar formalisms (e.g.  It therefore seems likely that grammars of the type considered in this paper (i.e.  Earley, 1970; Lang, 1974; Pratt, 1975   Dynamic storage minimisation, deferring structure copying e.g.  required by the unification operation or by constituent creation until absolutely necessary (e.g.  unification success or parse success, respectively   For this reason, the implementation employs a sparse representation for the array, since only a small proportion of the elements are ever filled.  In this parser, the same sort of duplication of unifications occurs as in the LR parser, so lists of partial analyses are cached in the same way.  The ANLT grammar also failed to parse three of these, plus an additional four.  Table 1 also shows the results for the CLE parser with the CLARE2.5 grammar and lexicon.  Both grammars give a total of around 280 analyses at a similar level of detail.  Moore Dowding further investigation shows that the speed-up is near the maximum that is possible with the ANLT grammar (around 50
