 if a belief is not salient it cannot be used in deliberation or means-end-reasoning.  This means that mistakes that agents make in their planning process have a plausible cognitive basis.  These cost parameters support modeling various cognitive architectures, e.g.  This is impossible to do with corpus analysis alone.  In figure performance differences are plotted on the Y-axis and AWM settings are shown on the X-axis.  See figure .  For example, consider 1: Let's walk along Walnut St.  Clearly the rule does not hold.  Some tasks require that two agents agree on the reasons for adopting a proposal, e.g.  It's shorter.  The choice is hypothesized to depend on cognitive properties of B, e.g.  The DESIGN-HOUSE plan requires the agents to agree on how to DESIGN-ROOM-1 and DESIGN-ROOM-2.  Proposals 1 and 2 are inferred to be implicitly ACCEPTED because they are not rejected , .  The method is based on earlier simulation work by Carletta and Pollack , .  In Design-World, salience is modeled by AWM model, adapted from .  The actual locations are calculated modulo the memory size.
