 For example, the definition for dictionary is a book in which the words of a language are listed alphabetically   The words in Fig.  To begin, we assume every link has a constant length of 1.  The actual definition for link length will be given later.  If word A is used in the definition of word B, these words are expected to be strongly related.  An early attempt at automation was made by Wilks et al.  Co-occurrence Vector.  A variety of approaches have been proposed for solving it.  The x-axis indicates the number of example words for each or pair.  The example and test words are shown in Tables and , respectively.  Here we show some supplementary data that support these parameter settings.  Therefore, a dimension size of 1000 is sufficient or even redundant.
