 Unknown words have been semantically classified using knowledge intensive methods , , .  Link Grammar is not the only way to process grammars bidirectionally.  In fact, there is no reason why a more traditional context free grammar could not be processed bidirectionally .  We close with a discussion of related work and our plans for the future.  In cases such as this the lexicon is used as a knowledge source and will be used to resolve the issue.  All constraints on the usage of words are integrated into the lexicon.  To summarize, the following assignment of disjuncts satisfies the meta-rules and leads to the linkage shown below.  If all words are known in a sentence, it is valid only if the associated constraints have a solution.  This classification can be refined as other usages of `snipe' are encountered.
