 For example, Ostendorf et al.  When no increase is possible, the procedure terminates.  A factor is positive if it correlates positively with training scores, negative otherwise.  The numbers of correctly-processed sentences (i.e.  In the triple set for the other QLF, this triple is replaced by (cc_SpecificMeal,on,flight_AirplaneTrip   This is followed by statistical analysis to produce the following functions of each triple in the observed triple population.  More specifically, we use ln(A P1(a)P2(b)P3(c   More specifically we use .  (See , for a fuller explanation of the use of likelihood ratios   If this is successful, it might make these functions suitable for disambiguation in domains with larger vocabularies than ATIS.  This default set of twenty was used throughout the scaling factor work described in sections and .  Four functions return non-zero scores on these analyses.  If the best match is shared by several analyses, the average for those analyses is subtracted.  These linear simultaneous equations, one for each of , can be solved by Gaussian elimination.
