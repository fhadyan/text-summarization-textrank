 For a discussion on the linguistic significance of such restrictions, see .  Examples are: 1.  Therefore, the proofs of these theorems are deferred to the appendices.  if (y,f,s) and (y,f,t) are in E, then s=t; 2.  Definition thedefctr: 1.  disjunctions and negations are out   the root node of T is start, and 2.  all daughters of v are leaves, which are labeled with , and 3.  the daughters of v that are leaves are labeled with , and 4.  In , it is shown that the recognition problem for R-AVGs is -complete.  There exists an R-AVG G such that L=L(G   Furthermore, we can construct an attribute-value language that simulates the stack S.
