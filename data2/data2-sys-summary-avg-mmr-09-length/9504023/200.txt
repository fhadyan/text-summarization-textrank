 Also the performance is usually no better than the statistical counterparts [   The accuracy is calculated from the formula: .  This research was partially supported by POSCO (Pohang iron and steel company   The corpus was selected from the one provided by ETRI (Electronic and Telecommunication Research Institute Korea.  The rest of the sections are organized as follows.  Section discusses the two-phase learning architecture, its process model and the training procedures.  Section demonstrates the performance of TAKTAG with extensive experiments and finally section draws some conclusions of the works.  Below are the characteristic of Korean that must be considered for POS tag-set and tagging system design.  The statistical approaches are insufficient for the agglutinative languages (such as Korean) which have usually complex morphological structures.  For the above reasons, a morphological analysis play important roles in Korean POS tagging system.  For single morpheme, a path name in the POS symbol hierarchy (e.g.  The means that the rule can see the several composite contexts at one time.  However, designing the tagging rules with knowledge engineering is tedious and error-prone.
