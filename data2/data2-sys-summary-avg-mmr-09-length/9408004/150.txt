 By using the proper branch method of axiomatising the grammar, the structure building section of the parser is only constrained in that it must produce proper branches; it is therefore possible to experiment with different interpreters (i.e.  There is also only a single level of representation (which is explicitly constructed for output purposes but not consulted by the parser   Since this information is not referenced until later, the COMP feature is used to limit the number of superfluous proper-branches generated by the parser.  On the other hand, if probabilities calculated during the parse take all the different types of probabilities into account at each calculation i.e.  In order to force the choice of the `best' parse on to the verb, the probabilities of theta grids for nouns, prepositions, etc.  was kept constant.
