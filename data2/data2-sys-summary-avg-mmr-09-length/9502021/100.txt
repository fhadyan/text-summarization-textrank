 However, this is not the end of the story.  Productions specify not only how nonterminals can be rewritten but also how their associated stacks are modified.  We denote trees with first order terms.  This can be repeated an unbounded number of times so that all full binary trees are produced.  This condition also rules out the Turing Machine simulation.  Slightly more generally, pltg can generate the language for any and context-free language L.  Vijay-Shanker and Weir showed that the behaviour of the naive algorithm can be improved upon.
