 Current lexical research in language technology is eminently knowledge-based in this respect.  Identification.  The structure of the paper will be as follows.  Again, in the knowledge-based approach, the lexical requirements for such a system are extensive.  There is no representational difference between regularities, subregularities, and exceptions.  The contents of memory (the lexical exemplars) can be approximated as a set of rules for convenience.  for further discussion of these issues   In general, this is not a problem in NLP, where for most problems large corpora are available or can be collected.  Another problem concerns long-distance dependencies, especially in syntax.  1 illustrates the difference between the two approaches.  The learning component implements a learning method.  Unfortunately, successful solutions are limited and few.  V is the set of possible values for feature f.  Finally, |D| is the number of patterns in a (sub)database.  Recently, Cost and Salzberg ( ) modified this metric by making it symmetric.  In a lazy learning approach, on the other hand, knowledge acquisition is automatic.
