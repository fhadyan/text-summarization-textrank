 Current lexical research in language technology is eminently knowledge-based in this respect.  Identification.  Segmentation.  The structure of the paper will be as follows.  Again, in the knowledge-based approach, the lexical requirements for such a system are extensive.  There is no representational difference between regularities, subregularities, and exceptions.  for further discussion of these issues   Another problem concerns long-distance dependencies, especially in syntax.  1 illustrates the difference between the two approaches.  Unfortunately, successful solutions are limited and few.  V is the set of possible values for feature f.  Finally, |D| is the number of patterns in a (sub)database.  Recently, Cost and Salzberg ( ) modified this metric by making it symmetric.  In a lazy learning approach, on the other hand, knowledge acquisition is automatic.
