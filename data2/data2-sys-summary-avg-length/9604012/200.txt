 Now free stems which may stand on their own can be assigned =0..  sing..  3rd masc and those which require a VIM in the form of a prefix (e.g..  perfect suffix (e.g..  Table 1 provides the results of analysing verbal classes..  The test for each class represents analysing most of its inflexions..  (Performance will be less if additional rules are added for larger coverage The results may not seem satisfactory when compared with other prolog implementations of the same formalism (cf..  Most non-vocalised strings give more than one solution, and some inflectional forms are homographs even if fully vocalised (e.g..  3rd masc..  = plural 1st common, and sing..  = sing..  As a result, two-level implementations - e.g..  The pa el measure of the same verb, viz..  t) and applying the appropriate vocalism {ae .  In generation, the opposite state of affairs holds..  SemHe fulfils this requirement..  The whole grammar can be taken as the composition of the two grammars: e.g..  This structure of stems can be handled hierarchically using -theory..
