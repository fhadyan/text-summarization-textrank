 Analysis for these cases is one of our future problem..  This interpretation coincides with native's intuition..  This interpretation coincides with native's intuition..  Analysis of case in which a directional auxiliary verb i.e..  `yaru kureru' is used is left as the future problem..  Another candidate is the property sharing thoery ..  Therefore these constraints are local in subordinate clause..  Firstly we show garu's syntax..  Garu is the present form and its root form is gar..  Therefore inflections are as follows: gar-re,gar-i, etc..
