 Now for some examples..  This collection includes the grammatical functions (e.g..  subj, obj, iobj) together with some longer transitions such as obl;objand to;obj..  What should be done? We see three possible responses..  The drawback is the complexity it introduces into an (up till now) quite simple story..  The third strategy is both simpler and more speculative..  In our view this is crucial..  This has at least two advantages..  Firstly, it offers the prospect of meaningful comparison of linguistic frameworks..  Secondly, it can highlight anomalous aspects of a given system..  The main point of the present paper is to show that such detours are unnecessary..  We will freely use the usual tree terminology such as mother-of, daughter-of, dominates, and so on..  Although models pin down the essence of the LFG universe, our work has only just begun..  For a start, not all models are created equal..  The key idea underlying our approach is to think about LFG model theoretically..  Firstly, LFG grammars impose constraints on ..
