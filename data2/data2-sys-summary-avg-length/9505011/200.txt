 It is clear that a formal evaluation scheme would be of great help..  The contingency table obtained for this pair of classes is shown in Table 2..  To resolve a conflict, one of the system classes must be re-mapped..  We have used a threshold value of 0.20..  Since semantic classes are often domain-specific, their automatic acquisition is not trivial..  Once all classes in the two clusterings have been accounted for, calculate the precision, recall, and F-measure as explained in ..  In one of our experiments, the 400 most frequent nouns in the Merck Veterinary Manual were clustered..  Three experts were used to evaluate the generated noun clusters..  Some initial experiments have shown that WordNet consistently improves the F-measures for these noun classes by about 0.05 on an average..  More work definitely needs to be done in this area..  A prime example of the latter is WordNet which has been used to provide such semantic classes , to assist in text understanding..  Our efforts to obtain such semantic clusters with limited human intervention have been described elsewhere ..
