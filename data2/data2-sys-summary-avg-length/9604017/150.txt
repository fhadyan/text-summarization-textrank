 The first is the popular idea of statistical tagging e.g..  When utterances had more than one correct reading, a preference heuristic was used to select the most plausible one..  The experiment was carried out using both the chunking criteria from (the Old scheme and the chunking criteria described in Section above (the New scheme .  The scheme is fully implemented within a version of the Spoken Language Translator system , , and is normally applied to input in the form of small lattices of hypotheses produced by a speech recognizer..  Section describes the constituent pruning method..  In both cases, the coverage loss due to grammar specialization was about 10 to 12% using training corpora with about 5,000 examples..  Note that only the non-phrasal rules are used as input to the chunks from which the specialized grammar rules are constructed..
