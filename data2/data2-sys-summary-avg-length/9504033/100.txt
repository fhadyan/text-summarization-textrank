 In the experiments below the accuracy of such a system is measured..  Each of a range of training schemes are employed..  Five training schemes have been applied with these extensions..  Each of two parameterisations are used: associations between words and associations between concepts..  The experiments above demonstrate a number of important points..  The significance of the use of conceptual association deserves some mention..  A range of windowed training schemes are employed below..  This renders their experiment inconclusive..  Note that windowed counts are asymmetric..
