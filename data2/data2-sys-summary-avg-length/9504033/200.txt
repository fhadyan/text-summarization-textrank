 In the experiments below the accuracy of such a system is measured..  In the three-word window training scheme, the guess rates are less than 1 .  Each of a range of training schemes are employed..  Five training schemes have been applied with these extensions..  Results are computed with and without tuning factors suggested in the literature..  For comparison, the untuned accuracy figures are shown with dotted lines..  Conceptual association outperforms lexical association, presumably because of its ability to generalise..  Each of two parameterisations are used: associations between words and associations between concepts..  The experiments above demonstrate a number of important points..  The significance of the use of conceptual association deserves some mention..  I have argued that without it a broad coverage system would be impossible..  A range of windowed training schemes are employed below..  While substantial work on noun compounds exists in both linguistics (e.g..  It uses what I will call the DEPENDENCY MODEL..  This renders their experiment inconclusive..  Two types of training scheme are explored in this study, both unsupervised..  Note that windowed counts are asymmetric..
