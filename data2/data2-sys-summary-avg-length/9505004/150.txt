 Definition 4.1 A DATR interpretation is a triple , where 1..  U is a set; 2..  Intuitively, U is the domain of (semantic) values/paths..  For example, consider again the definition of the node from the theory of figure , and repeated below..  unification failure .  of type .  In the following sections this viewpoint is made more precise..  The semantics of DATR is then covered in two stages..  That is: The set is referred to as the definition of N(in .  As a result the default mechanism is effectively over-ridden..  In order to understand the use of global (i.e..  That is: Consequently, the required value is that associated with at the `global node' (i.e..  In a similar fashion, the value associated with at is obtained as (i.e..
