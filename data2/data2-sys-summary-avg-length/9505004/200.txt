 Definition 4.1 A DATR interpretation is a triple , where 1..  U is a set; 2..  Intuitively, U is the domain of (semantic) values/paths..  For example, consider again the definition of the node from the theory of figure , and repeated below..  unification failure .  The provision of a formal semantics for DATR is important for several reasons..  In the following sections this viewpoint is made more precise..  The semantics of DATR is then covered in two stages..  Paths are denoted by P..  That is: The set is referred to as the definition of N(in .  As a result the default mechanism is effectively over-ridden..  In order to understand the use of global (i.e..  In this case, the global context will initially consist of the node/path pair ..  That is: Consequently, the required value is that associated with at the `global node' (i.e..  In a similar fashion, the value associated with at is obtained as (i.e..  The former has no effect on the global context, while the latter effectively overwrites it..
