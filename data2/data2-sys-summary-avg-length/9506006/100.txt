 Obtaining resources proved to be a stumbling block..  This is particularly true when the annotation scheme of one corpus is replaced by another..  Although a few PACs already exist only a few tagset pairings are covered..  This automatically results in a PAC being formed..  Some taggers convert words not normally capitalised into lowercase, but not all do..  This causes problems trying to match the words again once annotation has taken place..  Worse, the item may be transformed altogether..  The words next to the islands can be examined in turn..
