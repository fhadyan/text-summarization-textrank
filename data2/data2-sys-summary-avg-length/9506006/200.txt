 Obtaining resources proved to be a stumbling block..  For example, the corpus could have copyright restrictions or could be collected for dictionary compilation..  Annotate the Spoken English Corpus using the mapping..  This is particularly true when the annotation scheme of one corpus is replaced by another..  A process of refinement of the automatic annotator by feedback derived from the mapping would be established..  However, we anticipate that the method will be even more useful when dealing with mapping between parse trees..  Although a few PACs already exist only a few tagset pairings are covered..  This automatically results in a PAC being formed..  Some taggers convert words not normally capitalised into lowercase, but not all do..  This causes problems trying to match the words again once annotation has taken place..  Some parsers alter the text they annotate; again making the alignment process more difficult..  Worse, the item may be transformed altogether..  The words next to the islands can be examined in turn..  The Spoken English Corpus contains the short header: (In Perspective Rosemary Hill .
