 Instead of generating four separate messages as in Fig..  It also activated DSS-DLC for CSA 3208 in 1994 Q3 Fig..  3 is an overview of PLANDoc's architecture..  The ontologizer adds hierarchical structure to messages to facilitate further processing..  Coordination has been the object of considerable research (for an overview, see .  domain independence: the algorithm should be applicable in other domains..  Then the system attempts to generate concise and unambiguous text for each action group separately..  This reduces the problem size from tens of messages into much smaller sizes..  Sorting: putting similar messages right next to each other..  It raises issues such as deciding when and how to coordinate..  In Fig..  Attribute class and action (Fig..  1) are ignored because they are always the same at this stage..  The resulting message list after sorting each attribute is shown in Fig..  The list of sorted messages is traversed..  Input to PLANDoc is a series of messages, or semantic functional descriptions (FD, Fig..  There are other interesting problems in aggregations..
