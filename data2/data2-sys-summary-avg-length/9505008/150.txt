 Instead of generating four separate messages as in Fig..  3 is an overview of PLANDoc's architecture..  The ontologizer adds hierarchical structure to messages to facilitate further processing..  Coordination has been the object of considerable research (for an overview, see .  domain independence: the algorithm should be applicable in other domains..  This reduces the problem size from tens of messages into much smaller sizes..  Sorting: putting similar messages right next to each other..  It raises issues such as deciding when and how to coordinate..  In Fig..  Attribute class and action (Fig..  1) are ignored because they are always the same at this stage..  The resulting message list after sorting each attribute is shown in Fig..  The list of sorted messages is traversed..  There are other interesting problems in aggregations..
