 it must be easy to construct..  The corpus consists of transliterated dialogues on business appointments..  Training and test parts are disjunct..  The initial log perplexity of the training part is 0.12..  Computation would not have been feasible without this reduction..  Figure also shows the perplexity's slope..  Again, we find the discontinuity at the point where the constraint is changed..  The rest of the paper is structured as follows..  These can be calculated in the following way..  Thus, each step of merging is O(l[3 .
