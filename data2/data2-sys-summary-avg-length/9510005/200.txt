Both these approaches achieve better coverage by constructing the grammar fully automatically..  No one has yet shown that any robust parser is practical and useful for some NLP task..  Magerman's (1995) parser is an extension of the history-based parsing approach developed at IBM (e.g..  The current coverage of this system on a general corpus (e.g..
