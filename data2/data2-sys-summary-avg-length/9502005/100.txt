 Such a case is represented schematically in figure (see next page .  This is problematic in case C1 provides essential bindings for the successful evaluation of the complement C2..  The approach allows efficient bidirectional processing with similar generation and parsing times..  In this paper we adopt the latter theoretically more interesting perspective..  the generation analog of left recursion in parsing..  Three optimizations were especially helpful..  The third indexes lexical entries which is necessary to obtain constant-time lexical access..  However, despite these heuristic improvements, the problem of goal-directedness is not solved..
