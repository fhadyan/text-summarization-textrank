 Bidirectionality of grammar is a research topic in natural language processing that is enjoying increasing attention ..  Such a case is represented schematically in figure (see next page .  This is problematic in case C1 provides essential bindings for the successful evaluation of the complement C2..  The approach allows efficient bidirectional processing with similar generation and parsing times..  In this paper we adopt the latter theoretically more interesting perspective..  Three optimizations were especially helpful..  By matching forward and backward indices, the edges that must be combined for completion can be located faster..  The third indexes lexical entries which is necessary to obtain constant-time lexical access..  However, despite these heuristic improvements, the problem of goal-directedness is not solved..  This test-grammar is based on the implementation of an analysis of partial VP topicalization in German in the Troll system ..
