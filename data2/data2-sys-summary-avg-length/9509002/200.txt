 The probability of the most likely value in each bin is constant..  There are two sources of error in statistical language learners of the kind we are considering..  For each module which is to employ SLL, an appropriate technique must be selected..  The reader may check for herself that the results hold generally when the above extra term is included..  The main difficulty with the function G is the appearance of ..  Because this data can be expensive, foreknowledge of data requirements is highly valuable..  A program to compute this to a high degree of accuracy has been implemented..  The assumption that bin probabilities are uniform is problematic..  When this is true the expected number of training instances in the same bin as a random test instance is approximately ( .  Thus we can expect much more information to be available about typical test cases..  Despite this need, very little attention has been paid to the problem..  Figure shows five traces of accuracy as the volume of training data is varied..  When the distribution is non-uniform, simulations show that convergence can be much more rapid..
