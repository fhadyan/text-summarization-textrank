 There are two sources of error in statistical language learners of the kind we are considering..  For each module which is to employ SLL, an appropriate technique must be selected..  The main difficulty with the function G is the appearance of ..  Because this data can be expensive, foreknowledge of data requirements is highly valuable..  A program to compute this to a high degree of accuracy has been implemented..  The assumption that bin probabilities are uniform is problematic..  Thus we can expect much more information to be available about typical test cases..  Despite this need, very little attention has been paid to the problem..  Figure shows five traces of accuracy as the volume of training data is varied..  When the distribution is non-uniform, simulations show that convergence can be much more rapid..
