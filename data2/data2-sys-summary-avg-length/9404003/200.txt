 Nonetheless, without this ability, the utility of synchronous TAGs is severely diminished..  First, however, we digress to discuss some notational issues..  We will use the following notational conventions for synchronous TAGs and related notions..  This assumption is highly suspect..  Bilingual dictionaries do not codify perfect translations in any sense, if such a notion is even coherent..  The doctor treats Jean's teeth..  The doctor treats his teeth..  John runs up the street..  This possibility, though tantalizing, remains to be explored..  It remains for future research to tune the exact requirements on the allowable mappings..  The possibility to interleave the computations of the phases does not make their definition any simpler..  TAG derivation trees are composed of nodes, conventionally notated as , possibly in its subscripted variants..  This exclusion makes the definition of the derived tree for a given derivation tree determinate..  A derivation is a pair where 1..  Several aspects of this definition are noteworthy..  Thus, in the grammar of Figure , the links in the auxiliary trees can never be operated on..
