 In the above verb phrase A=0, V=joined, N1=board, P=as, and N2=director..  An iterative, unsupervised method was then used to decide between noun and verb attachment for each triple..  the above inequality is strictly less-than or greater-than .  The training and test data were both the unprocessed, original data sets..  This section gives results which justify this..  The development set with no morphological processing was used for these tests..  The algorithm has the additional advantages of being conceptually simple, and computationally inexpensive to implement..  Finally, more training data is almost certain to improve results..  `Always noun attachment' means attach to the noun regardless of (v,n1,p,n2 .  Results of 77.7% (words only) and 81.6% (words and classes) are reported..  describes backed-off n-gram word models for speech recognition..  The cut-off frequencies must then be chosen..  Else (default is noun attachment .  All other strings of numbers (including those which had commas or decimal points) were replaced with the token `NUM .  All strings `NAME-NAME' were then replaced by `NAME .
