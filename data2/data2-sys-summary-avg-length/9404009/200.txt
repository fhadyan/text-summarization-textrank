 We have used our implementation to verify that no other outcomes are possible, since manual verification would be rather laborious..  Intuitively, this noun phrase may not take wider scope than the quantifier every candidate, on which its restriction depends..  This is more satisfactory, since it does not reduce the problem of proper quantifier scoping in the object language to the same problem in the metalanguage..  For readability, we will often uncurry as ..  These two phrase structure rules do not encode semantic information; they specify only how grammatical functions such as are expressed in English..  The association between and a meaning P is represented by the atomic formula , where is an otherwise uninterpreted binary predicate symbol..  It is this resource-sensitivity of natural language semantics an expression is used exactly once in a semantic derivation that linear logic can model..  Thus, the formula linearlyentails B..  This generality is in part achieved by using grammatical functions rather than functor-argument relations to represent syntactic predicate-argument relationships..  In the following we will notate Q R S meaning more perspicuously as Q(z,Rz,Sz .
