 This was quite an encouraging result which, actually, agreed with our prediction..  It applies first morphological prefix and suffix guessing rules and then ending-guessing rules..  Among these words were: classified applied tries tried merging subjective etc..  when the M element of the rule is empty..  So, instead of using a proper morphological processor, we adopted an engineering approach which is argued for in ..  Therefore the contribution of the morphological rules is valuable and necessary for the robust POS-tagging of real-world texts..  This rule works, for instance, for words [developed undeveloped .  This is where word- POS guessers take their place - they employ the analysis of word features, e.g..  The learning is implemented as a two-staged process with feedback..  word leading and trailing characters to figure out its possible POS categories..  So the application of a guessing rule can be described as: unknown-word - S + M : I R i.e..  Of course, not all acquired rules are equally good as plausible guesses about word-classes..  There are two types of test-data in use at this stage..
