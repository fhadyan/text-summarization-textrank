 Before describing how we adapt this technique to the case of plpatr we discuss the sense in which plpatr derivations exhibit a context-freeness property..  However, this is not the end of the story..  Productions specify not only how nonterminals can be rewritten but also how their associated stacks are modified..  We denote trees with first order terms..  The formalism as currently described can be used to simulate arbitrary Turing Machine computations..  This can be repeated an unbounded number of times so that all full binary trees are produced..  This condition also rules out the Turing Machine simulation..  Note that the feature structure at the root of a plpatr derivation tree will not involve re-entrancy..  This approach does not address the fundamental issue of the tradeoff between the descriptive capacity of a formalism and its computational power..  Slightly more generally, plig can generate the language for any and regular language R..  Slightly more generally, pltg can generate the language for any and context-free language L..  Vijay-Shanker and Weir showed that the behaviour of the naive algorithm can be improved upon..  Consider Figure ..
