 Suppose, for instance, is the tree of Figure , labeled as shown..  The grid is the structure where This is the structure of the (discrete) first quadrant..  The proof is carried out in detail in ..  It will necessarily be somewhat meager both in the details of the definition and in the details of the underlying theory..  These are just indices assigned to elements that receive what are termed referential Theta roles..  This is defined, in as follows: In words, this says simply that x is an -antecedent-governor of y iff x is in a non-argument position, it c-commands y, no barrier intervenes between x and y, and no non-argument specifier falls between xand y..  Using this, we can define the link relation..  This is the conflation of two sentences: Whoi has ti told you Alice invited him..  Given that the number of heads participating in these structures is arbitrary, there can be no a priori bound on the number of overlapping chains..  The second result is more surprising..  Models for , then, are tuples ..
