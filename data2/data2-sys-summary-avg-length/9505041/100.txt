 The proof is carried out in detail in ..  It will necessarily be somewhat meager both in the details of the definition and in the details of the underlying theory..  This is defined, in as follows: In words, this says simply that x is an -antecedent-governor of y iff x is in a non-argument position, it c-commands y, no barrier intervenes between x and y, and no non-argument specifier falls between xand y..  Using this, we can define the link relation..  Models for , then, are tuples ..
