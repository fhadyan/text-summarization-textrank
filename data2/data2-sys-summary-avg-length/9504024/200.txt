 This phenomenon is analysed by along the lines of autosegmental phonology ..  The error surface vowels are written in italics..  The `glottal_change' rule would be a normal morphological spelling change rule, incorporating contextual constraints (e.g..  As each root does not occur in all vocalisms and patterns, each lexical entry is associated with a feature structure which indicates the possible patterns and vocalisms for a particular root..  A common mistake is to choose the wrong pattern..  Usually this feature-clash situation creates the problem of which constituent to give preference to ..  This results in the vowels being shifted one position, e.g..  * wkatubi instead of wakutib ..  /ktab while the root {n t} takes the vowel , e.g..  /n et .  The following convention has been adopted..  Their formalism appears in (2 .  In the multi-tape version, lexical expressions (i.e..  If this fails, analysis is attempted again without the `no error' restriction..  infixes, prefixes and suffixes..  prefixes and suffixes..  Spreading examples appear in (6 .  The expectation of this reapplication is allowed for in reap = y..
