 The algorithm is again described by Cutting et al..  and by Sharman, and a mathematical justification for it can be found in Huang et al..  (1990 .  The first major use of HMMs for part of speech tagging was in CLAWS in the 1970s..  In the above example, 8 iterations were sufficient..  The results of the Xerox experiment appear very encouraging..  In the first place, Cutting et al..  The kind of biasing Cutting et al..  Other estimation formulae have been used in the past..  For an introduction to the algorithms, see Cutting et al..  (1992 or the lucid description by Sharman (1990 .  Firstly, two of the tests, D2+T1 and D3+T1, give very poor performance..  Initial maximum Highest accuracy on the first iteration, and falling thereafter..
