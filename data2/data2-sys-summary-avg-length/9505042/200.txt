 The procedure for extracting discourse information is as follows: 1..  Table shows an example of such information..  A lower score, 0.1, is awarded for each ambiguous modifiee-modifier relationship, since such relationships are less reliable..  After all the sentences except the ill-formed sentences that caused incomplete parses have provided data for use as discourse information, the parse completion procedure begins..  The completion procedure consists of two steps: For each word in a partial parse, the part of speech and the modifiee-modifier relationships with other words are inspected..  (3.1) Fig..  (3.2) In the operation of the invention, an operator loads cartridges into the magazine from the operator's side as seen in Figs..  3 and 12..  (151st sentence) (3.3) Fig..  Two partial parses are joined if the root (head node) of either parse tree can modify a node in the other parse without crossing the modification of other nodes..  These matching conditions at different levels are applied in such a manner that partial parses are joined through the most preferable nodes..
