 The set of variables occurring in a tree t is denoted by ..  Sequences of variables are written as , or ..  Constraints are atomic constraints closed under conjunction..  First-order formulae build over constraints are denoted by ..  Its interpretation is defined by ..  We say that a formula is valid, if holds for all V1-V2-substitutions with ..  A constraint is satisfiable in the tree-model , if there exists a -V-solution of ..  For example, we allow as an instance of even if ..  The set of components of a variable x is denoted by ..
