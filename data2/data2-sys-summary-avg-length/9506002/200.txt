 This allows to do type diagnosis for records and objects..  Type diagnosis along this line is discussed in depth in ..  The algorithm is given fully in terms of constraint simplification..  For proofs and a detailed discussion of related work see ..  Section gives a simple algorithm which is correct but non-terminating..  Section concludes and gives a brief outlook..  The set of variables occurring in a tree t is denoted by ..  Sequences of variables are written as , or ..  Constraints are atomic constraints closed under conjunction..  First-order formulae build over constraints are denoted by ..  We define to be the least binary relation on such that is associative and commutative..  We define the application of f to a sequences of sets of trees elementwise, ..  We say that a formula is valid, if holds for all V1-V2-substitutions with ..  A constraint is satisfiable in the tree-model , if there exists a -V-solution of ..  The trees of are called ground trees..  For example, we allow as an instance of even if ..  The set of components of a variable x is denoted by ..
