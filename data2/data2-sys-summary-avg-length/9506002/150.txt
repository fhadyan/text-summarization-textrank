 This allows to do type diagnosis for records and objects..  Section gives a simple algorithm which is correct but non-terminating..  Section concludes and gives a brief outlook..  The set of variables occurring in a tree t is denoted by ..  Sequences of variables are written as , or ..  Constraints are atomic constraints closed under conjunction..  First-order formulae build over constraints are denoted by ..  We define to be the least binary relation on such that is associative and commutative..  We say that a formula is valid, if holds for all V1-V2-substitutions with ..  A constraint is satisfiable in the tree-model , if there exists a -V-solution of ..  The trees of are called ground trees..  For example, we allow as an instance of even if ..  The set of components of a variable x is denoted by ..
