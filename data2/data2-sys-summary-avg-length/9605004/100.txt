 The following example illustrates this..  Intuitively, there are two reasons for this..  In the case of (11) the equations corresponding to (17) are , and ..  Only for the analysis of the interaction of e.g..  ellipsis with focus phenomena (cf..  a -coloured symbol .  Note that only variables without colours can be abstracted over..  the colour erasures have to be equal..  In what follows, we show how each phenomenon is dealt with..  We then illustrate by an example how their interaction can be accounted for..
