 The following example illustrates this..  's binding principle .  Intuitively, there are two reasons for this..  Incidentally, the projection is only a -unifier of our coloured example, if and are identical..  In the case of (11) the equations corresponding to (17) are , and ..  Only for the analysis of the interaction of e.g..  ellipsis with focus phenomena (cf..  section ) do we need a more elaborate formalization, which we will discuss there..  a -coloured symbol .  Note that only variables without colours can be abstracted over..  ) and that symbols that carry different colours are treated differently..  the colour erasures have to be equal..  section .  In what follows, we show how each phenomenon is dealt with..  We then illustrate by an example how their interaction can be accounted for..
