 Under these assumptions, the equation for (4a) will be (6a) which has for unique solution (6b .  The following example illustrates this..  Intuitively, there are two reasons for this..  We see that this lifts the constant from the argument position to the top..  Incidentally, the projection is only a -unifier of our coloured example, if and are identical..  In the case of (11) the equations corresponding to (17) are , and ..  In what follows, we present a unification framework which solves both of these problems..  Only for the analysis of the interaction of e.g..  ellipsis with focus phenomena (cf..  section ) do we need a more elaborate formalization, which we will discuss there..  a -coloured symbol .  Note that only variables without colours can be abstracted over..  ) and that symbols that carry different colours are treated differently..  the colour erasures have to be equal..  section .  In what follows, we show how each phenomenon is dealt with..  We then illustrate by an example how their interaction can be accounted for..
