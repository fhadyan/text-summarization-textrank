 The morpheme-connectivity-matrix and phoneme-connectivity-matrix are encoded with the special Korean POS (part-of-speech) symbols and compressed..  The fact that the segmented speech performance is not much better than the continuous one (93.8% vs..  1) A Korean word, called Eojeol, consists of more than one morphemes with clear-cut morpheme boundaries..  The n-best list [ word-graph [ and word-lattice [ ] techniques are mostly used in this purpose..  These changes include consonant and vowel assimilation, dissimilation, insertion, deletion, and contraction..  These signal characteristics make it difficult to directly use phonemes or syllables as sub-word recognition units..  The diphones have the co-articulation handling features similar to the popular triphones [ ] but are much fewer in numbers..  From the resulting diphone sequences, the necessary phoneme lattice has to be constructed..  The morphological analysis starts with the phoneme lattice..  The central part of the morphological analysis lies in the dictionary construction..  In our dictionary, each phonetic transcription of single morpheme has a separate dictionary entry..  For single morpheme, the left and the right POS tags are always same..
