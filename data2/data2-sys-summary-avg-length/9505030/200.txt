 However, in our full fragment, additional support is provided to achieve and constrain this rule chaining..  Thus, for example, whq, rel, and topic are mutually exclusive..  Becker's sharp distinction between his metarules and his hierarchy gives rise to some problems that our approach avoids..  which metarules are applicable for this entry (1993,126 .  However, he does suggest a way in which the hierarchy could be completely replaced by metarules but argues against adopting it (1993,136 .  In representing such a tree in DATR, we do two things..  ; Daelemans .  It also has an NP to its right, and a tree rooted in a P to the right of that, with a PP parent and NP right sister..  Each such node is a description of an LTAG tree at some degree of abstraction..  However, the LTAG formalism itself does not provide any direct support for capturing such regularities..  Since complements are daisy-chained, all the others move up too..  However, space does not permit presentation or discussion of the DATR code that achieves this here..
