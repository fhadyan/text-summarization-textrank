 Two purposes are served here: checking the word is lexical (i.e..  This morphological lookup operates over a character trie which has been compressed into a (directed) graph..  Common endings are shared and category information is stored on the first unique transition..  If the word is unknown, the system reconsiders analysis from the point where it broke down with the added possibility of an error rule..  Under examination will be the number of errors missed/caught and wrongly/rightly corrected..  Different components and configurations of the system will be compared, for example the error rules v..  p.b.t s..  Parameters of the system will be varied, for example the breadth of the purview, the position of the purview focus, the number of correction candidates and the timing of their generation..  For comparison, a variety of other data has been collected..  To investigate issues involved in shallow processing and cooperative error handling, the pet (processing errors in text) system is being built..  The focus is on these two issues; no attempt is being made to produce a complete product ..
