 All our experiments involve the asymmetric model described in the previous section..  Unsurprisingly, the training set relative entropy decreases monotonically..  Our approach avoids both problems..  Instead, the only information about the objects is the statistics of their joint appearance..  At this point we need to specify the clustering model in more detail..  While variations of p(n|c) and p(v|c) in equation ( are not independent, we can treat them separately..  The free energy determines both the distortion and the membership entropy through with temperature ..
