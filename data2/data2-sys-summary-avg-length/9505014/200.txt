The structures that result are equivalent to classical truth tables..  Rule 1 For an open branch such that , unless i) , or ii) , or iii) there is some ..  Rule 2 For a tableau with at least one open branch , iff ..  I give the first few examples in detail to show how the rules operate..  This agrees with the intuitive behaviour that had to be modelled..
