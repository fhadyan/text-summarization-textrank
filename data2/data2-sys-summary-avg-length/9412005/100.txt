 Primarily, two sources have been examined: prosody and word stress..  In terms of hits, false alarms and misses, we have: Results are given in Table ..  Clearly phonotactic constraints are useful, as both recall and accuracy improve..  We imagine hypotheses represented as a string of ones and zeros..  74-75 .  Finally, before the samples were fed to the simulations, divisions between words (but not between sentences) were removed..  Each simulation was run on each sample, for a total of twelve DIST runs..
