 Therefore the default rule can make the conclusion that the structure is inconsistent, which is what we desire..  The second rule is used for checking completeness and it works similarly to the any-definition above..  an inconsistent structure, while default logic does not allow this outcome..  An intuitive interpretation of the defined rule below is that if X is believed ( failure should be derived..  Therefore, its computational properties are unclear and needs more investigation..  This work has been supported by the Swedish Research Council for Engineering Sciences (TFR .  Young for providing me with much-needed information about his and Bill Rounds' work..  In this paper the notation is used whenever a subsumes b (i.e..  One such class of constructions is those that have some degree of nonmonotonic behaviour..  Examples of such constructions are any-values, default-values, and some constructions (e.g..  The last condition on a nonmonotonic sort, , may seem superfluous..  Otherwise the default rule would have no effect and can be removed..  Based on these observations, a sufficient condition for w-explanation is defined as follows..
