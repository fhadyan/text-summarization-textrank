 an inconsistent structure, while default logic does not allow this outcome..  An intuitive interpretation of the defined rule below is that if X is believed ( failure should be derived..  Therefore, its computational properties are unclear and needs more investigation..  Young for providing me with much-needed information about his and Bill Rounds' work..  In this paper the notation is used whenever a subsumes b (i.e..  One such class of constructions is those that have some degree of nonmonotonic behaviour..  Examples of such constructions are any-values, default-values, and some constructions (e.g..  The last condition on a nonmonotonic sort, , may seem superfluous..  Otherwise the default rule would have no effect and can be removed..  Based on these observations, a sufficient condition for w-explanation is defined as follows..
