 However, this idea needs to be further refined..  Jespersen (1954) is one of the earliest to note these, commenting on the LIGHT VERBS in expressions such as take a walk..  However, defining these rules by hand for all nouns would be too time-consuming to be practical..  Non-content words are then those that belong to the closed classes, such as prepositions, auxiliaries and so on..  The theoretical global information is a measure of how productive a given support verb is: that is, how many different instances of the SV-NP construction it enters into..  This weighting technique is similar to that used by Yarowsky (1992) in the context of sense disambiguation..  So aggregating all of these should reinforce the support verbs and not the others..  Some verbs have this information encoded in their entries: for example, adjust lists adjustment as its nominalisation; there were 257 verbs in this category..  So if only the cases where enough data exists are considered, and if alternative support verbs are allowed, the success rate becomes 14 of 15..
