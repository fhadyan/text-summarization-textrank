 Two assumptions are made regarding lexical-semantic indexing..  For reasons of space, the computation of outer domains cannot be described fully here..  First, the inner domains of the grammar are calculated..  This work will be reported at a later date..  The indices involved in determining connectivity are specified as parameters for a particular formalism..  For example, in HPSG, they would be indicated through paths such as SYNSEM:LOCAL:CONTENT:INDEX..  Since the computational complexity of the greedy bag generator is polynomial (i.e..  Nevertheless, a certain amount of unnecessary work is performed..  Phillips phillips93 proposes handling inefficiency at the expense of completeness..  His idea is to maintain a queue of modifiable constituents (e.g..  N1s) in order to delay their combination with other constituents until modifiers (e.g..  Take the following bag: Ex..  Thus, a more complex grammar would allow `the man' from the bag Ex..  Such a wfss will have been constructed during the bag generation process..  We distinguish variables by uniquely typing them..  Updating the graph involves three steps..
