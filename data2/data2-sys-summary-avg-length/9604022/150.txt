 Then we multiplied these results by the corpus frequency of this particular word and averaged them..  Thus the most frequent words had the greatest influence on the aggreagte measures..  In Table 1 some results of that experiment are shown..  Two types of mis-taggings caused by the guessers occured..  The learning is implemented as a two-staged process with feedback..  Both the software and the produced guessing rule-sets are available by contacting the author..  In our approach we decided to reuse the data which come naturally with a tagger, viz..  In the example above (VBD VBN) is the I-class of the rule and (JJ) is the R-class..  word leading and trailing characters, to figure out its possible POS categories..  We adopted 90% confidence for which z(1-0.90 2 = z0.05 = 1.65..
