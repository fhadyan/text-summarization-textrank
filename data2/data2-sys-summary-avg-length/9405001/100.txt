 Other types of conditional cooccurrence probabilities have been used in probabilistic parsing ..  An obvious case is that of trigrams, for which the sparse data problem is much more severe..  Their similarity-based model avoids clustering altogether..  Using this scheme, they predict which unobserved cooccurrences are more likely than others..  The best parameter values found were k=60, t=2.5, and ..  The similarity model was correct in 64 cases, and the back-off model in 32..  This advantage for the similarity model is statistically significant at the 0.01 level..
