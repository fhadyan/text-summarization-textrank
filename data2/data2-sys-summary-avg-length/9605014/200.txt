 This is probably because the data size we had was not large enough..  We conclude with the following remarks..  We thank Mr nK.Nakamura, Mr nT.Fujita, and Dr nK.Kobayashi of NEC CC Res..  Labs..  for their constant encouragement..  We thank Dr nK.Yamanishi of CC Res..  Labs..  A noun partition is any set satisfying , and ..  A verb partition is defined analogously..  We will now describe how the description length for a model is calculated..  As a strategy of statistical estimation MDL is guaranteed to be near optimal..  where f(Cn,Cv) denotes the observed frequency of the noun verb pairs belonging to cluster (Cn,Cv .  There is no guarantee, however, that the employed smoothing method is in any way consistent with the clustering method used subsequently..  Our method based on MDL resolves this issue in a unified fashion..  For instance, the speed of convergence of the models selected by MDL to the true model is known to be near optimal..  We conducted the same simulation experiment for some other models and found the same tendencies..
