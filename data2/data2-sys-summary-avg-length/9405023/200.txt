 Locally ambiguous symbol nodes are compared in terms of the words skipped within them..  The features are designed to be general and, for the most part, grammar and domain independent..  For each parse, the heuristic computes a penalty score for each of the features..  The penalties of the different features are then combined into a single score using a linear combination..  The parser then selects the parse ranked best (i.e..  The number of substituted words 3..  The fragmentation of the parse analysis 4..  The GLR parser is the syntactic engine of the Universal Parser Architecture developed at CMU [ .  Our experiments have indicated that, in most cases, a less fragmented analysis is more desirable..  We have recently augmented the parser with a statistical disambiguation module..  The weights assigned to the features determine the way they interact..  The resulting grammar has 458 rules, which translate into a parsing table of almost 700 states..  Our goal was three-fold..  The first run was with skipping disabled..  The results indicate that using the GLR* parser results in a significant improvement in performance..
