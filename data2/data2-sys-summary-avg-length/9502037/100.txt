 The formalism should be fine-grained, ie..  Two of these will now be sketched..  \t\t .  For instance in the example sentences, `the' has the generalized transitions: \t\tS [ ] N [VP, ] \t\tS(np) [ ] N [VP(np ] which can be further generalized to the single transition: aaS( ) [ ] N\t\tS( ) [ ] N [VP( t\t = set of features 3..  the analysis differed from the hand parse in some non-trivial way..
