 The formalism should be fine-grained, ie..  Two of these will now be sketched..  \t\t .  For instance in the example sentences, `the' has the generalized transitions: \t\tS [ ] N [VP, ] \t\tS(np) [ ] N [VP(np ] which can be further generalized to the single transition: aaS( ) [ ] N\t\tS( ) [ ] N [VP( t\t = set of features 3..  Unknown words in the input, of which there were obviously many, were assigned to one of seven orthographic classes and given appropriate transitions calculated from the corpus..  exactly the same as the hand parse or differing in only relatively insignificant ways which the model could not hope to know..  the analysis differed from the hand parse in some non-trivial way..
