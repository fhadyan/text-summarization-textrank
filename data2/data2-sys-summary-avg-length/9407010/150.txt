 One point of experimental method is interesting enough to be worth a diversion..  Uncertain: Other cases..  The results are summarized in Table ..  A popular solution has been the N-best list e.g..  The rest of the paper is laid out as follows..  Section concludes..  This section describes how different knowledge sources (KSs) can be combined..  Information can be of two different kinds..  Discrimination functions are discussed in more detail shortly..  dT(L) for a given linguistic item L is computed as follows..  This is typically a large negative integer..  what is the fares .  Intuitively, highest-in-coverage seems a promising idea..  There are also some other possibilities, cf..  Recognizer score + linguistic KSs 3..  All available KSs In order to facilitate comparison, some other methods were tested as well..
