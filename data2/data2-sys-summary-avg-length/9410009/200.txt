 An important question here is how dramatic this loss of translation quality really is..  We consider one case briefly..  Our work is related to research by ( .  In some respects it is an extension of some of their suggestions..  We have provided an illustration on how to proceed in one such case..  Our work differs from theirs in scope and also in the exploration of various other directions..  In this section we review this operation..  First we consider the features of Mel'cuk's treatment that we have wanted to preserve..  Next we show how they have been imported into the HPSG framework..  The argument corresponds to the base and each value is a collocate..  Choosing the level at which lexical functions will be situated..  There are various reasons for this..  We use SEM/SMALL&gt IND as an abbreviation for the feature path SEM.CONT.IND..  Just as in the ECD the base contains a specific zone in which the collocates are listed..  In HPSG, the descriptions of complex expressions are constrained by principles..  We will assume that collocations are subject to the same constraints..
