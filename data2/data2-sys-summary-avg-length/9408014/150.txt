 More specifically, we will say the translation relation between a source logical form and a target logical form holds if we have where B is a set of monolingual and bilingual meaning postulates, and S is a set of formulas characterizing the current context..  Instead of feature based syntax trees and first-order logical forms we will adopt a simpler, monostratal representation that is more closely related to those found in dependency grammars (e.g..  rational debate..  We are thus interested in the conditional probability of Wt given As..  Taylor, Grover, and Briscoe 1989 .  Our aim will be to provide an overall model for translation with the best of both worlds..  The most common types of meaning postulates in R are those for restriction, hyponymy, and disjointness, expressed as follows: restriction; hyponymy; disjointness..
