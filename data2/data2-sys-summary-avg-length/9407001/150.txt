 The boundary between morphology and syntax is fuzzy..  Instead, it is handled separately in a backtrackable fashion..  The central relation is the morphology predicate, (see Fig..  Thus, infinite loops when concatenating are avoided..  As a result of this constraint interaction the structure shown in Fig..  is obtained..  As such it is well suited as a linguistic theory for our enterprise..  argue against the use of two-level morphology because of linguistic considerations..  Instead, they base their implementation on autosegmental phonology (cf..  This is certainly linguistically appealing..  Surprisingly, they have not been widely applied in this domain up to now..  Morphs have a functor-argument structure along the lines of ..  Others are triggered by a mixture of phonological and morphological facts..  below .  Reducing interface problems is therefore crucial to success..
