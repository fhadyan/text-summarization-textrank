 The concatenation of sequences U and V is denoted by (U,V .  We omit the proof for reasons of space..  We denote this language by L(G .  We can use a the standard transformation of an arbitrary cfr..  Note that since the subset of LMBK already accounts for the cfr..  Example..  Our claim now is that a given 3-Partition problem is solvable if and only if is in ..  Otherwise there would be a simpler proof without this abstraction..  We consider each direction in turn..  Suppose ..  for w3m .
