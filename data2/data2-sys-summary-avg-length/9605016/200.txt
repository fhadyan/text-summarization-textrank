 Taken for themselves these variants of LMBK are of little use in linguistic descriptions..  The concatenation of sequences U and V is denoted by (U,V .  We omit the proof for reasons of space..  We denote this language by L(G .  An SDL-grammar is defined exactly like a Lambek grammar, except that replaces ..  We can use a the standard transformation of an arbitrary cfr..  grammar to a categorial grammar G .  Note that since the subset of LMBK already accounts for the cfr..  Example..  Consider the following grammar G for the language a[n] b[n] c[n .  Hence, only strings containing the same number of a's, b's and c's may be produced..  Moreover the notation A[k]stands for We then define the SDL-grammar as follows: The word we are interested in is ..  Our claim now is that a given 3-Partition problem is solvable if and only if is in ..  Otherwise there would be a simpler proof without this abstraction..  We consider each direction in turn..  Suppose ..  for w3m .
