 VM-GEN uses an extension of Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs, cf..  This rule is represented in the grammar as a part of the description of subcategorization frames for verbs..  We provide the system with default descriptions..  We mean by multilinguality that the same processing is applied for different languages..  Default handling can be easily adapted to the requirements of multilingual generation by using language-specific default-descriptions..  For all knowledge sources the question arises how knowledge can be shared..  We intend to use core knowledge sources for representing common phenomena..

During simultaneous interpretation requests are rather unusual..  how the knowledge for default handling is described (see section 2.3 and 4..  Reliability: Errors in an utterance may cause misunderstanding..  On the other hand, maximal fluency necessitates the use of assumptions and repair, respectively..  Thus, default handling should be triggered immediately..  We propose the explicit use of time-limits for delay intervals..  Defaults may be handled in a way that differs from the `normal' processing of the system, e.g as short-cuts..
