 There is no linguistic justification..  They can't be omitted because they structure sentences and make them understandable..  The number of words to hold is quiet subjective..  These improvements haven't been implemented yet and will be the object of further works..  It requires to distinguish first, middles and last syllabs..  The realization simply implements the previous ideas..  If so, incremented their likelihood to be selected..  If so, incremented their likelihood to be selected..  This algorithm has a linear complexity in time..  The results we obtained were expected..  From 1 to 3 words, there are mainly total undeterminations..  Deductions really start between 4 and 6 words..  Methods described in must be implemented to improve results in this case..  For less than 8 words there are still ambiguities or total undetermination..
