 On examination of the grammar and the corpus, it is possible to understand why this has happened..  These are relatively easy to mark and recognise when the punctuation is available..  The results of the parse now became much more tractable..  Unexpected constructs caused it to fail totally..  Punctuation, as we consider it, can be defined as the central part of the range of non-lexical orthography..  Although arguments could be made for including the sub-lexical marks (e.g..  hyphens, apostrophes) and structural marks (e.g..  Intuitively, this seems very wrong..  Delimiters (e.g..  It should be stressed that this grammar is solely one of tags, and so is not very detailed syntactically..  Thus a rule for the additional of a punctuation mark after a lexicalised noun would be as in (14 .  In order to incorporate the phenomena of interaction between punctuation and lexical expressions (e.g..  Similarly for rules which performed the same function at different levels in the grammar (e.g..  The number of parses ranged from 1 to 520, with an average of 38..
