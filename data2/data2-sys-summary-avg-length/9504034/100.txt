 Parameters are tied together for similar c to prevent data sparsity..  From this starting point, the Inside-Outside algorithm is run until convergence..  Our algorithm consistently outperformed the Inside-Outside algorithm in these experiments..  This work demonstrates that Solomonoff's elegant framework deserves much further consideration..  To achieve this goal, we employ several approximations..  To minimize these effects, we process the training data incrementally..  These choices were necessary to make the search tractable..  Similar research includes work by Cook et al..  (1976) and Stolcke and Omohundro (1994 .
