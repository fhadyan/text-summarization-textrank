 Parameters are tied together for similar c to prevent data sparsity..  From this starting point, the Inside-Outside algorithm is run until convergence..  Our algorithm consistently outperformed the Inside-Outside algorithm in these experiments..  After completing the implementation of our move set, we plan to explore the modeling of context-sensitive phenomena..  This work demonstrates that Solomonoff's elegant framework deserves much further consideration..  The initial grammar is listed in Table ..  To achieve this goal, we employ several approximations..  To minimize these effects, we process the training data incrementally..  Referring to the rules in Table , the parameter is set to an arbitrary small constant..  The remaining symbols are set to expand uniformly among their possible expansions..  A conspicuous shortcoming in our search framework is that the grammars in our search space are fairly unexpressive..  These choices were necessary to make the search tractable..  However, Solomonoff does not specify a concrete search algorithm and only makes suggestions as to its nature..  Similar research includes work by Cook et al..  (1976) and Stolcke and Omohundro (1994 .
