 Parameters are tied together for similar c to prevent data sparsity..  From this starting point, the Inside-Outside algorithm is run until convergence..  Our algorithm consistently outperformed the Inside-Outside algorithm in these experiments..  This work demonstrates that Solomonoff's elegant framework deserves much further consideration..  To achieve this goal, we employ several approximations..  To minimize these effects, we process the training data incrementally..  Referring to the rules in Table , the parameter is set to an arbitrary small constant..  The remaining symbols are set to expand uniformly among their possible expansions..  These choices were necessary to make the search tractable..  However, Solomonoff does not specify a concrete search algorithm and only makes suggestions as to its nature..  Similar research includes work by Cook et al..  (1976) and Stolcke and Omohundro (1994 .
