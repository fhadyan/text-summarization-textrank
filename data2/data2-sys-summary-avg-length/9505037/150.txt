 In this experiment, for an equivalent English and German vocabulary two co-occurrence matrices were computed and then compared..  The German vocabulary consisted of one by one translations of these words as chosen by Russell (1970 .  For each pair of words in the English vocabulary its frequency of common occurrence in the English corpus was counted..  Each of the curves increases monotonically, with formula having the steepest, i..  best discriminating characteristic..  Thereby, different sizes of the two matrices could be allowed for..  It can be expected that with such a method the quality of the results depends on the thematic comparability of the corpora, but not on their degree of parallelism..  As a further step, even with non parallel corpora it should be possible to locate comparable passages of text..
