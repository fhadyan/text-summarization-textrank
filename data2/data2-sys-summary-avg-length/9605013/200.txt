 P(arg2=1,prep=1) ] 0.25 ..  P(prep1=1,prep2=1) ] 0.25..  We conclude this paper with the following remarks..  It is also clear that relatively few of these random variables (case slots) are actually dependent on each other with any significance..  Labs..  for their constant encouragement..  We thank Mr nR.Isotani of NEC Information Technology Res..  Labs..  for his comments..  Such distributions are referred to as `dendroid distributions' in the literature..  A dendroid distribution can be represented by a dependency forest (i.e..  This problem has been investigated in the area of machine learning and related fields..  It repeats this process until no node pair is left unprocessed..  It is known that as a strategy of estimation, MDL is guaranteed to be near optimal..  Note that when we do not have enough data (i.e..  This is reasonable since with a small data size most case slots cannot be determined to be dependent with any significance..  Table shows the verbs that appeared in the data most frequently and the number of their occurrences..
