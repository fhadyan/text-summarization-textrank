 Thus doctor can refer to either a Ph nD..  sense and the childcare sense go by the wayside..

For example, in Figure , COIN, CASH, etc..  Each noun that occurred in the corpus was counted as an occurrence of each taxonomic class containing it..  For example, in Figure , an occurrence of the noun dime would be counted toward the frequency of DIME, COIN, and so forth..  The average correlation over the 10 subjects was r = 0.8848, with a standard deviation of 0.08..  A widely acknowledged problem with this approach, however, is that it relies on the notion that links in the taxonomy represent uniform distances..  Unfortunately, this is difficult to define, much less to control..  This is contrary to intuition..  Cases like this are probably relatively rare..  For example, Rada et al..  biological categories) are much denser than others..
