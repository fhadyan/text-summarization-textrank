 If they are well-formed, the system halts indicating success..  If not, another permutation is tried and the process repeated..  At the heart of this approach is that, once well-formed, constituents can only grow; they can never be dismantled..  We give an informal argument for this..  The complexity of this phase is therefore the product of the picking and combining complexities, i.e..  O(n[2 .  It is not that the transfer of information per se compromises the ideal such information must often appear in transfer entries to avoid grammatical but incorrect translation (e.g..  a great man translated as un homme grand .  A TNCB records dominance information from derivations and is amenable to incremental updates..  The structure is essentially a binary derivation tree whose children are unordered..  Undetermined TNCBs are commutative, e.g..  Let us introduce some terminology..  Deletion: A maximal TNCB can be deleted from its current position..  The structure above it must be adjusted in order to maintain binary branching..  Adjunction: A maximal TNCB can be inserted inside a maximal TNCB, i.e..
