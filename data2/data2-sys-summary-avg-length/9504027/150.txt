 If they are well-formed, the system halts indicating success..  If not, another permutation is tried and the process repeated..  At the heart of this approach is that, once well-formed, constituents can only grow; they can never be dismantled..  We give an informal argument for this..  O(n[2 .  It is not that the transfer of information per se compromises the ideal such information must often appear in transfer entries to avoid grammatical but incorrect translation (e.g..  Undetermined TNCBs are commutative, e.g..  Let us introduce some terminology..  Deletion: A maximal TNCB can be deleted from its current position..  The structure above it must be adjusted in order to maintain binary branching..  Adjunction: A maximal TNCB can be inserted inside a maximal TNCB, i.e..  Dominance Monotonicity..
