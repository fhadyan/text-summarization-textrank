 which are generated..  We plan to follow up the current work by training and testing a suitable instantiation of our framework against manually annotated corpora..  Probabilities are assigned by the following inductive definition: P(N1) = 1..  In particular, the probability does not depend on the order in which the rules are applied..  The crucial advantage of PCFGs over CFGs is that they can be trained and/or learned from corpora..  Readers for whom this fact is unfamiliar are referred to Charniak's textbook , Chapter 7 .  On the basis of the usefulness of probabilistic context-free grammars , ch..  The paper is structured as follows..  Probabilities are assigned by the following inductive definition: P(NT1) = 1..  This can be done, and the method which we adopt has the merit of simplicity..
