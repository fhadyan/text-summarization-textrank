 which are generated..  We plan to follow up the current work by training and testing a suitable instantiation of our framework against manually annotated corpora..  Probabilities are assigned by the following inductive definition: P(N1) = 1..  In particular, the probability does not depend on the order in which the rules are applied..  On the basis of the usefulness of probabilistic context-free grammars , ch..  The paper is structured as follows..  This can be done, and the method which we adopt has the merit of simplicity..
