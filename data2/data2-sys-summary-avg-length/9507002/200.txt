 The special tokens and @ refer to the EN and to the ES respectively..  The example shows that the entries in the words and morphemes sections are just copied..  But this framework would be useless if it were computationally intractable..  It is automatically derived from the Source Lexical Base..  The sections that can appear in the Source Lexical Base are reviewed below..  The morphemes section is intended for the inclusion of inflectional morphemes with a grammatical function..  The more frequent clients of this section are very irregular words, usually with an auxiliary function..  Rule invocation, however, is made when a particular child entry from that class is processed..  Each lemma will be expanded to different entries when the Object Dictionary is compiled..  For very irregular lemmas, the entry is usually longer, because all the information must be provided inside..  The examples that illustrated above the classes section had two rule invocations..  A special identity allomorphy rule invocation is provided as the token .  Regular expressions are the standard ones of the UNIX operating system, so they will not be discussed here..
