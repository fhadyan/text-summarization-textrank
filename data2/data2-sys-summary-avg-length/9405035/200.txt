 The interconnections among the three systems explain the interdependent functional behavior..  Based on the above structural assumption, dual-coding theory proposes a parallel set of processing assumptions..  Naming objects and imaging to words are prototypical examples..  The bilingual dual-coding theory partially answers the above questions..  This intermediate representation may be Lexical Concept Structure or interlingua ..  This engineering approach requires great effort in designing the representation and the mapping rules..  However, the accuracy is low..  An information-theoretical network has two layers..  Besides, an information-theoretical network has the following advantages: (1) it learns fast..  The network can learn in a single pass without gradient decent..  (2) it is adaptive..  These make the network more psychologically plausible..  One network is constructed for each phrasal category (NP, VP, AP, etc .  The domain of our work was the Conference Registration Telephony Conversations..  There were 300 English/German f-structure pairs available from other research tasks ..  Studies on cross-language transfer and cross-language priming have provided evidence for both hypotheses , ..  Little human effort on knowledge engineering is required..
