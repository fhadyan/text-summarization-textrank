 Our syntax for subtype declarations, given in ( combines information about subtyping and disjointness..  All the Yi are subtypes of X, and all Yi are disjoint..  X &gt; [Y 1.1 Y 1.n .  vdots vdots vdots \ onumber X &gt; [Y m.1 ldots,Y m.k .  The denotation of each type is a subset of the domain..  A difference arises with type restrictions for feature values..  In our system, the type axioms are restricted to subtyping (which corresponds to implication) and disjointness..  In this section, we apply the conception of multi-dimensional inheritance to systemic classification networks, which have been discussed in ..  Figure shows a systemic classification network for English pronouns taken from ..  In effect, this is an expansion of the disjunctive entry conditions to disjunctive normal form..
