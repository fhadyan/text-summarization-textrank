 Prolog A primary goal of abstract-syntax is to support recursion through abstractions with bound variables..  However, the implementation issues, although more complex, are also well-understood and it can be expected that future work will bring further improvements..  The CCG rules shown in Figure 1 are implemented in the system described in this paper..  Each of the three operations have both a forward and backward variant..  In section 3 it will be seen how the use of abstract syntax allows this to be expressed directly..  In first-order unification, it is simulated as shown in Figure 2..  (7a) (7b) For example, when processing (1a rule (7a) would be used with: with the result which is -equivalent to (2 .
