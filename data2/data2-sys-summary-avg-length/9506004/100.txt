 Prolog A primary goal of abstract-syntax is to support recursion through abstractions with bound variables..  The techniques used here should allow similar advantages for a variety of such theories..  The CCG rules shown in Figure 1 are implemented in the system described in this paper..  Each of the three operations have both a forward and backward variant..  In section 3 it will be seen how the use of abstract syntax allows this to be expressed directly..  In first-order unification, it is simulated as shown in Figure 2..
