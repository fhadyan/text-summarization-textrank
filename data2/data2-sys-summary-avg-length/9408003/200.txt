 For example, the conventional interpretation of the description `it is black' is true of a soot particle, but false of a snowflake..  I call a finite sequence of attributes a path, and write for the set of paths..  [ Definition P is the path interpretation function under I iff [ I is an interpretation , P is a total function from to the set of partial functions from U to U, and for each , [ is the functional composition of ..  ] ] ] [ By induction on the length of ..  ] ] ] [ Theorem For each feature structure F, [ F is satisfiable iff F approximates some morph..  ] ] [ From propositions and ..  ] [ Suppose that and is a bijection from ordinal to ..  ] ] [ From propositions and ..  The Troll unifier is closed on these representations..  Thus, though is computationally expensive, Troll uses only during compilation, never during run time..  A signature provides the symbols from which to construct typed feature structures, and an interpretation gives those symbols meaning..
