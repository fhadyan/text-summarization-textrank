Only those path sets S are considered which satisfy the property that the extensions of each path in S are identical..  Therefore the f-structure reached by each of these paths is identical..  In the examples discussed in Dalrymple et al..  That is, the f-structure Gf appears at the end of the singleton path P in the f-structure Ff..  Following Dalrymple et al..  Dalrymple et al..  The meaning constructors for the lexical items are given in Figure ..
