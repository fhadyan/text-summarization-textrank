 The SAtree for has root labelled by the name for and k subtrees ..  In this case, the label li is the pair (j,n .  A SIC is a finite set of elementary node addresses (ENAs .  In purely CFG-based approaches, these relations are only implicit..  Observe that in both trees an argument has been fronted..  The derivation proceeds as follows..  The DTG operation of subsertion is designed to overcome this limitation..  Section briefly discusses DTG recognition algorithms..  Note that components are shown as triangles..
