 The SAtree for has root labelled by the name for and k subtrees ..  The edge from the root of to the root of the subtree is labelled by li ( ) defined as follows..  In this case, the label li is the pair (j,n .  A SIC is a finite set of elementary node addresses (ENAs .  In purely CFG-based approaches, these relations are only implicit..  Therefore, the subject will have to raise out of its clause for agreement and case assignment..  Before subserting its nominal arguments, we sister-adjoin the two adjectival trees to the tree for hotdogs..  Observe that in both trees an argument has been fronted..  The derivation proceeds as follows..  The derived structure is shown in Figure ..  We illustrate the problem by considering Kashmiri wh-extraction, drawing on Bhatt ..  The DTG operation of subsertion is designed to overcome this limitation..  For this reason, we have equipped DTG with an operation (sister-adjunction) that does exactly this and nothing more..  Section briefly discusses DTG recognition algorithms..  Note that components are shown as triangles..
