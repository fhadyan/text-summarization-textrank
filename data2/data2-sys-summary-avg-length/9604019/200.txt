 E.g in figure the magic_s rule: magic_s(finite,SSem t\tmagic_sentence(decl(SSem .  Also with respect to the dependency constraint an optimization of the rules in the grammar is important..  (1996 .  Of course, the author is responsible for all remaining errors..  At the same time it often remains unclear how these optimizations relate to each other and what they actually mean..  Magic makes filtering explicit through characterizing it as definite clauses..  (1992 .  Initially P[mg] is empty..  Finally, step 4 of the algorithm ensures that a seed is created..  The modified versions of the original rules in the grammar are adapted accordingly..  The original rules of the program are extended such that these bindings can be made effective..  This, however, is not represented in order to keep the figure clear..  These optimizations are direction independent in the sense that they are useful for both generation and parsing..  Consider the following magic rule: magic_vp(VForm CSem|Args SSem t\tmagic_vp(VForm,Args,SSem .  This information can then be used to discard the culprit..
