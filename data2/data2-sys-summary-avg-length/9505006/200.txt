 In their most common implementations, logic grammars resort to list representations of the strings being analyzed or synthesized..  The implicit information that the first conclusion holds only if the premiss of the second sentence does not hold must be inferred..  Paul Tarau also thanks for support from the FESR of the Universit de Moncton..  and or but is treated as a demon..  requantification..  We also adopt the heuristics that closer scoped coordinations will be attempted before larger scoped ones..  Notice that backtracking can occur..  Coordination has long been a difficult problem both in linguistics and in language processing..  tries Z=4 and fails..  likes(dan,golf) contains a primary occurrence of the parallel element, dan and must therefore be discarded..  We exemplify using a logic based semantics along the lines of ..  Several observations are in order..  Since these structures are quite dissimilar, we must conjoin only the parallel elements..  Note that some special cases allow to use unification between isomorphical objects to obtain the proper quantification..  Take for instance the sentence Each man and each woman ate an apple .
