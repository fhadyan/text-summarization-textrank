 We are presenting results on two versions..  In the case of 80 clusters the results do not change significantly..  The number of clusters, however, should be constrained for the search space to be effectively limited..  It is assumed that the translation of the segments of the database that cover the input sentence is known..  Automatic sub-sentential alignment is, however, a problem yet to be solved..  Turning to the definition of the metric of similarity, the requirement is usually twofold..  In section 2 a similarity metric is proposed and analysed..  If such matches are traced, the relevant sentences are segmented and then the updated corpus is reclustered..  But sentence segmentation is not a straightforward matter..  Sentences can, however, be quite long..  We only have potential translatable unit markers..
