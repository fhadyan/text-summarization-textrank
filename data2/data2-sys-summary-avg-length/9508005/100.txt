 We are presenting results on two versions..  In the case of 80 clusters the results do not change significantly..  The number of clusters, however, should be constrained for the search space to be effectively limited..  Automatic sub-sentential alignment is, however, a problem yet to be solved..  Turning to the definition of the metric of similarity, the requirement is usually twofold..  In section 2 a similarity metric is proposed and analysed..  But sentence segmentation is not a straightforward matter..  We only have potential translatable unit markers..
