 For each parsed sentence in the tree growing corpus, the correct state sequence is traversed..  each tagging event is used for growing the tagging tree, etc .  The parsing procedure is a search for the highest probability parse tree..  This treebank is described in great detail in ..  After over ten years of grammar development, the IBM parser achieved a 0-crossing-brackets score of 69 .  On this same test set, SPATTER scored 76 .  The leaf nodes represent the unique states in the decision-making problem, i.e..  Thus, it can consider very large history spaces, i.e..  The leaf distributions in decision trees are empirical estimates, i.e..  For detailed descriptions and discussions of the decision-tree algorithms used in this work, see ..
