 Experiments with this system revealed three major problems which our current research is addressing..  To date, no robust parser has been shown to be practical and useful for some NLP task..  Brill, 1994) require similar amounts (Gaizauskas, pc .  However, there is a large decrease in accuracy with no training data (i.e..  We described an implemented system, and evaluated its performance along several different dimensions..  The distinction between arguments and adjuncts is expressed, following X-bar theory (e.g..  The number of analyses varies from one (71 to the thousands (0.1 .  The multiple uses of commas cannot be resolved without access to (at least) the syntactic context of occurrence..  Black et al..  1.313[20.1] and 1.300[22.6 .  Unification of the `residue' of features not incorporated into the backbone is performed at parse time in conjunction with reduce operations..  A probabilistic LR parser was trained with the integrated grammar by exploiting the Susanne treebank bracketing..  250 sentences from the new treebank, selected randomly, were kept back for testing..  Harrison et al 1991 .
