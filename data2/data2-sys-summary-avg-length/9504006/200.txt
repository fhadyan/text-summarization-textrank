The number of dialogues was small and taken from a single problem domain..  It seems likely therefore that some of our findings (e.g the central shift) will be specific to the diagnostic dialogues we studied..

The data were recordings of telephone conversations between clients and an expert concerning problems with software..  Examples of prompts were things like Yes and Uhu .  Indirect commands (i.e..  The mean number of turns in each phase was 8.03..  We therefore went on to analyse the conditions in which such interruptions occurred..  3.4 Cue reliability..  We conducted a similar analysis for those cue words that have been identified in the literature..
