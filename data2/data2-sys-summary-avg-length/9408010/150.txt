 We use of the data as training and the rest as testing data..  However, the immediately preceding word leads to an even bigger reduction of about 34 .  It is possible, that more accurate data (e.g..  fewer, but only correct pairs) would lead to a different result..  The circles correspond to states and the arcs to transitions..  Given this automaton, we then consider each occurrence of a noun (e.g..  Entries that would not normally be considered verb-object pairs are marked with .  In this paper, we report on our work in progress on this topic..  Given these probability estimates pG(yl|xk the likelihood FMLof the training data, e.g..  The so-called leaving-one-out technique is a special case of cross-validation ( , pp.75 .  Moreover, we do not consider infrequent words (e.g..
