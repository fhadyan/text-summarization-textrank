 For example, the definition for dictionary is a book in which the words of a language are listed alphabetically .  The word dictionary is thus linked to the words book, word, language, and alphabetical..  To begin, we assume every link has a constant length of 1..  The actual definition for link length will be given later..  If word A is used in the definition of word B, these words are expected to be strongly related..  An early attempt at automation was made by Wilks et al..  When the frequency of X or Y is zero, we can not measure their co-occurence likelihood, and such cases are not exceptional..  We compared the two vector representations by using them for the following two semantic tasks..  A variety of approaches have been proposed for solving it..  The x-axis indicates the number of example words for each or pair..  The example and test words are shown in Tables and , respectively..  Here we show some supplementary data that support these parameter settings..  Therefore, a dimension size of 1000 is sufficient or even redundant..
