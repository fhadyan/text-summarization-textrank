 To begin, we assume every link has a constant length of 1..  The actual definition for link length will be given later..  An early attempt at automation was made by Wilks et al..  A variety of approaches have been proposed for solving it..  The x-axis indicates the number of example words for each or pair..  The example and test words are shown in Tables and , respectively..  Here we show some supplementary data that support these parameter settings..  Therefore, a dimension size of 1000 is sufficient or even redundant..
