 One example is the processing of an unknown sequence of words, e.g..  Another approach is to limit the size of the categories that are being employed..  Cycles might emerge to treat unknown sequences of words, i.e..  The resulting parse-forest grammar will be too general most of the times..  A practical variation can be conceived as follows..  sentences with unknown parts of unknown lengths ..  Furthermore the paper benefitted from remarks made by the anonymous ACL reviewers..  A context-free grammar is represented as a definite-clause specification as follows..  FSA of course generalizes such word lattices..  Therefore, we are interested in methods that only generate a small subset of this; e.g..  A yes-no problem is undecidable (cf..  The following definition and example of a PCP are taken from [chapter 8.5 .  An instance of PCP consists of two lists, and of strings over some alphabet ..  Furthermore, let and ..  A solution to this instance of PCP is the sequence 2,1,1,3 (obtaining the sequence 101111110 .  For an illustration, cf..  Furthermore let and ..  Furthermore, there is a rule 3..
