 Unbounded application of , however, might expand the tree indefinitely..  We believe this represents an improvement on previous attempts..  The architecture proposed seems promising..  Calculi intermediate in power between AB and L have been explored (e.g..  gapping, ) and expansion (e.g..  right dislocation, .  See for a survey..  They cannot even simulate truth-tables in polynomial time..  So, we have to appeal to some extrinsic mechanism to express contradiction..  Combinations of types are accounted for in the labelling algebra by the composition operator..
