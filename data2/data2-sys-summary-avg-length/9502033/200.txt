 We propose in this paper an algorithm that deals with both phenomena, in the same analyser..  5) Repeat (3) and (4 until all PPs and anaphors are treated..  referring to an entity in the same sentence then its resolution may depend on one of the previous prepositional phrases..  - The pronoun its can not be resolved by the anaphora resolution module because it is preceded by unattached PPs ; its resolution is skipped..  The attachment of both PPs is then skipped..  Notice that even if each module is called several times, there is no redundancy in the processing..  These rules are applied to the conceptual representation and their output is a set of candidate antecedents..  The attachment module has been implemented at 99 .  Presently we are working on the extension of the anaphora module particularly to deal also with the anaphoric definite noun phrases..  This work was accomplished in the context of COBALT project (LRE 61-011 dealing with financial news..  A detailed discussion about both procedures of anaphora resolution and PP attachment is largely developed in (Azzam, 1994 .
