 The outermost bracket is the root-node..  Begin Function , where Step 0..  S contains no formula , and 2..  ProofFrom , Proposition 5.4 .  In the next section we will present a fixed regular grammar..  The recognition problem of this unification grammar is decidable, because the regular grammar does not contain detours..  The reader should check that the feature-graph indeed conforms to the formulas of the applied rules..  First, S derives in a steps..  We have to show that is generated by G..  Hence 1) and 2) follow from fact ..  The question that arises is whether the complexity of a feature theory provides a lower bound for the complexity of such a unification grammar..  Likewise, we speak of linear time, etcetera..  The feature theory contains reentrance, but no negation or disjunction..
