 The outermost bracket is the root-node..  The correctness and the complexity of the algorithm FEATUREGRAPHSAT follow from , Section 5 .  Begin Function , where Step 0..  S contains no formula , and 2..  ProofFrom , Proposition 5.4 .  The recognition problem of this unification grammar is decidable, because the regular grammar does not contain detours..  The rules of Section are annotated with formulas taken from the feature theory given in Section ..  Example(s)We will show the potential derivation of the string ..  The reader should check that the feature-graph indeed conforms to the formulas of the applied rules..  First, S derives in a steps..  Let be a propositional logical formula in conjunctive normalform, and f the reduction stated above..  We have to show that is generated by G..  Hence 1) and 2) follow from fact ..  The question that arises is whether the complexity of a feature theory provides a lower bound for the complexity of such a unification grammar..  Likewise, we speak of linear time, etcetera..  The feature theory contains reentrance, but no negation or disjunction..
