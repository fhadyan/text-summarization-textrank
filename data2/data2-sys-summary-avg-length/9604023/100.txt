 It is only from the model-theoretic perspective that the question even arises..  This step completes the detachment of generative grammar from its procedural roots..  But the accompanying loss of language-theoretic complexity results is unfortunate..  While such results may not be useful in guiding syntactic theory, they are not irrelevant..  We look briefly at two of these issues..  The exceptions to the defaults are fully determined when the grammar is written..  Note that is symmetric..  The fundamental problem here is identifying each trace with its antecedent without referencing their index..
