 A grammatical theory expressed within such a framework is just the set of logical consequences of those axioms..  Each realized human language is just the intersection of the languages selected by the settings of its parameters..  It is only from the model-theoretic perspective that the question even arises..  This step completes the detachment of generative grammar from its procedural roots..  The abstract properties of the mechanisms that might implement those theories, however, are not beyond our reach..  In this way one might hope to illuminate the empirical consequences of these distinctions, should any, in fact, exist..  But the accompanying loss of language-theoretic complexity results is unfortunate..  While such results may not be useful in guiding syntactic theory, they are not irrelevant..  We look briefly at two of these issues..  The exceptions to the defaults are fully determined when the grammar is written..  As a result, although the treatment in GKPS is actually declarative, this fact is far from obvious..  Note that is symmetric..  The fundamental problem here is identifying each trace with its antecedent without referencing their index..
