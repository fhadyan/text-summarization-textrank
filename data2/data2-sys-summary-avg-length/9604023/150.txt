 These principles are simply properties of trees..  Each realized human language is just the intersection of the languages selected by the settings of its parameters..  It is only from the model-theoretic perspective that the question even arises..  This step completes the detachment of generative grammar from its procedural roots..  The abstract properties of the mechanisms that might implement those theories, however, are not beyond our reach..  But the accompanying loss of language-theoretic complexity results is unfortunate..  While such results may not be useful in guiding syntactic theory, they are not irrelevant..  We look briefly at two of these issues..  The exceptions to the defaults are fully determined when the grammar is written..  Note that is symmetric..  The fundamental problem here is identifying each trace with its antecedent without referencing their index..
