 This is basically the entropy used in ..  Until N[i] = N[i-1]4..  Until for some appropriate set metric (e.g..  N N(Smid 4..  Goto ; 6..  Hand-coded tree-cutting criteria..  Also, banning recursion by category specialization, i.e..  Entropy is a measure of disorder..  The entropy S of that system is then If each state has equal probability, i.e..  This can be done using for example interval bisection..  We have now reached a point of recursion and can index the corresponding subtree..  We will here describe three different ways of doing this, but there are many others..  This means that if we cut at a node corresponding to e.g..  an NP, i.e..  Until N[i] = N[i-1]4..
