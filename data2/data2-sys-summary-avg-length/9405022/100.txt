 Until N[i] = N[i-1]4..  Until for some appropriate set metric (e.g..  N N(Smid 4..  Goto ; 6..  Hand-coded tree-cutting criteria..  Entropy is a measure of disorder..  This can be done using for example interval bisection..  We have now reached a point of recursion and can index the corresponding subtree..  This means that if we cut at a node corresponding to e.g..  an NP, i.e..  Until N[i] = N[i-1]4..
