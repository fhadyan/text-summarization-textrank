 The Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP) model has a short, interesting, and controversial history..  Of course, some of this difference may be due to differences in implementation, so this estimate is fairly rough..  Furthermore, we believe Bod's analysis of his parsing algorithm is flawed..  However, Bod then neglects analysis of this term, assuming that it is constant..  We admit that this is a somewhat informal argument..  Of course, this research raises as many questions as it answers..  This will be complicated by the fact that sufficient details of Bod's implementation are not available..  This parse tree is most probable..  To show this reduction and equivalence, we must first define some terminology..  We will call non-terminals of this form interior non-terminals, and the original non-terminals in the parse trees exterior .  Similarly, for the right branch there are cl+1possibilities..  We show that it holds for trees of depth n+1..  The other six cases follow trivially with similar reasoning..  If every subtree in the training corpus occurred exactly once, this would be trivial to prove..
