 The Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP) model has a short, interesting, and controversial history..  Furthermore, we believe Bod's analysis of his parsing algorithm is flawed..  However, Bod then neglects analysis of this term, assuming that it is constant..  We admit that this is a somewhat informal argument..  Of course, this research raises as many questions as it answers..  This will be complicated by the fact that sufficient details of Bod's implementation are not available..  This parse tree is most probable..  To show this reduction and equivalence, we must first define some terminology..  Similarly, for the right branch there are cl+1possibilities..  Parsing using the DOP model is especially difficult..  We show that it holds for trees of depth n+1..  The other six cases follow trivially with similar reasoning..
