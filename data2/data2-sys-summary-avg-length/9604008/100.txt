 Furthermore, we believe Bod's analysis of his parsing algorithm is flawed..  We admit that this is a somewhat informal argument..  Of course, this research raises as many questions as it answers..  This will be complicated by the fact that sufficient details of Bod's implementation are not available..  This significantly speeds up parsing..  This parse tree is most probable..  Similarly, for the right branch there are cl+1possibilities..  We show that it holds for trees of depth n+1..  The other six cases follow trivially with similar reasoning..
