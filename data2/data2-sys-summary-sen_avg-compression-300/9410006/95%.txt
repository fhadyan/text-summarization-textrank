 In this analysis, error chains contributed 22 failures to Hobbs' algorithm and 19 failures to BFP All of the examples on which BFP succeed and Hobbs fails have to do with extended discussion of one discourse entity Neither Hobbs algorithm nor BFP attempt to cover these examples When both parties contribute discourse entities to the common ground, both algorithms may fail (n=4  This lets BFP get the two examples of event anaphora Two of the samples are those that Hobbs used when developing his algorithm A discourse module might combine theories on, e In this case the BFP centering algorithm and Hobbs algorithm both make ASSUMPTIONS about other system components There are two major sets of assumptions, based on discourse segmentation and syntactic representation For example, since the BFP salience hierarchy for discourse entities is based on grammatical relation, an implicit assumption is that an utterance only has one subject The BFP algorithm added linguistic constraints on CONTRA-INDEXING to the centering framework subject The Hobbs algorithm is based on searching for a pronoun's co-specifier in the syntactic parse tree of input sentences  Hobbs algorithm operates on one sentence at a time, but the structure of previous sentences in the discourse is available Hobbs does not assume a segmentation of discourse structure in this algorithm; the algorithm will go back arbitrarily far in the text to find an antecedent The order by which Hobbs' algorithm traverses the parse tree is the closest thing in his framework to predictions about which discourse entities are salient Hobbs also assumes that his algorithm can somehow collect discourse entities mentioned alone into sets as co-specifiers of plural anaphors
