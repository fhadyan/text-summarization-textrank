 The data contains about 19,000different direct object tokens, about 10,000 different verb tokens and about 140,000 different token pairs We use of the data as training and the rest as testing data The automaton then outputs a sequence of verb-object pairs, which constitute our training and testing data Given these probability estimates pG(yl|xk the likelihood FMLof the training data, e the probability of the training data being generated by our probability estimates pG(yl|xk measures how well the training data is represented by the estimates and can be used as optimisation criterion (  In the following, we will derive an optimisation function FML in terms of frequency counts observed in the training data It divides the data into N-1 samples as retained part and only one sample as held-out part Let Ti denote the data without the pair (X[i Y[i and pG,Ti(yl|xk) the probability estimates based on a given classification G and training corpus Ti75 during clustering
