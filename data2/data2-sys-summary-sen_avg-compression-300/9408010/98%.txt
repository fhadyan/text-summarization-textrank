 The data contains about 19,000different direct object tokens, about 10,000 different verb tokens and about 140,000 different token pairs We use of the data as training and the rest as testing data Given these probability estimates pG(yl|xk the likelihood FMLof the training data, e In the following, we will derive an optimisation function FML in terms of frequency counts observed in the training data
