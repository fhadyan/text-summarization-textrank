 In particular, it examines the relationship of the relative frequency of a verb in these light verb constructions to its lightness I have termed this knowledge GLOBAL INFORMATION Counting all occurrences of each verb, regardless of their objects, yields a global relative frequency for that verb To construct the global information, a comprehensive list of deverbal nominalisations is needed, together with the associated support verbs, determined from the local information Candidates for support verb were ranked in order of the product of local and global relative frequency of each candidate verb Notwithstanding these considerations, using the relative frequency of a verb in light constructions seems to be a fairly good indicator of a verb's content-freeness, providing plausible choices for support verbs for nominalisations
