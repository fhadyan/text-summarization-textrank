 In information retrieval, non-content words are discarded, as they cannot help to identify the topic of a text Halliday proposes that relative frequency of a word can be used to indicate the amount of information it contributes However, this idea needs to be further refined In the 8 million word Grolier's Encyclopedia the verb include (which definitely conveys information, so it can't be a light constituent) occurs transitively 4284 times, as against make's 2697 times For example, make a decision can be rewritten as decide, the light element being make There are quite a few of these constructions, such as light verbs with noun phrase complements, light verbs with adjectival complements, and light nouns with post-modifiers (Dras and Dale, 1995 but this paper only looks at one construction, the light verbs with NP complements By definition, these constructions will characteristically contain light verbs; this paper therefore proposes that a modified definition be used for indicating whether a word can be considered a non-content one: that the word has a high relative frequency in these light constructions In particular, it examines the relationship of the relative frequency of a verb in these light verb constructions to its lightness In a corpus of newspaper articles, they look for occurrences of the noun and corresponding verb to find the most likely candidate for the support verb In this paper, I conduct a similar experiment, finding support verbs for given nouns, to test the definition proposed above: that a word's status regarding content-freeness is related to its frequency of occurrence in light constructions A consequence of this is to be able to choose the light verb that corresponds to a nominalisation in a light verb-NP complement construction the nominalisation's support verb (SV  Grefenstette and Teufel use only LOCAL INFORMATION, information that is specific to a particular nominal Counting all occurrences of each noun in verb-object pairs yields a local relative frequency for each verb with respect to that noun So, to determine the support verb for proposal they look only at verbs which co-occur with the noun proposal Speakers also use the fact that make is the support verb for other nominalisations such as judgment and decision I have termed this knowledge GLOBAL INFORMATION Counting all occurrences of each verb, regardless of their objects, yields a global relative frequency for that verb In this experiment the local information is combined with the global information to produce a modified likelihood of being a support verb A heuristic for producing the local information involved searching the corpus for the nominal, determining the verb (if any) for which the nominal was the direct object, and measuring the relative frequency of these verbs The more productive verbs (like make) rank higher on the list than less productive verbs (like bear this is combined with the local information so that the more productive verbs, for a particular nominal, are subsequently ranked more highly than by the local information alone This means that there is a lot of noise all of the incorrect candidates for support verb are included in the global information but again, if the relative frequency hypothesis is true, the relative frequency of the support verb in the local information will be high (although not necessarily the highest while this is not true for non-support verbs To construct the global information, a comprehensive list of deverbal nominalisations is needed, together with the associated support verbs, determined from the local information A system to identify support verbs for nominalisations was implemented by tabulating all the verbs for which these nominals were the direct object The local information was generated for each of the excluded test set nominals and aggregated into the global information Candidates for support verb were ranked in order of the product of local and global relative frequency of each candidate verb Of the 18 examples, 13 of the choices for support verb match the corresponding one from the source text It is apparent that what constitutes a valid light verb construction depends on the genre and register of the text Notwithstanding these considerations, using the relative frequency of a verb in light constructions seems to be a fairly good indicator of a verb's content-freeness, providing plausible choices for support verbs for nominalisations Further work will involve extending this definition to other light constructions light verbs with adjectival complements, and light nouns with post-modifiers and fitting closed-class words, which traditionally comprise the class of non-content words, into the framework
