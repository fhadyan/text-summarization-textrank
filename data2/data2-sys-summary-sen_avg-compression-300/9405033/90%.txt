 Tomabechi, 1991) in systems using lexicalist grammar formalisms (e5 grammar, and Alshawi (personal communication) points out that the CLE parser had not previously been run with a grammar containing such a large number of rules, in contrast to the ANLT parsers Table 2 shows the relationship between sentence length and mean parse time with the BU-LC and LR parsers Comparison with the function suggests that, at least for the BU-LC parser, parse time is related roughly quadratically to input length unification success or parse success, respectively  Briscoe Carroll (1993) describe a methodology for constructing an LR parser for a unification-based grammar, in which a CF `backbone' grammar is automatically constructed from the unification grammar, a parse table is constructed from the backbone grammar, and a parser is driven by the table and further controlled by unification of the `residue' of features in the unification grammar that are not encoded in the backbone On each reduction the parser performs the unifications specified by the unification grammar version of the CF backbone rule being applied The space complexity is also cubic, since the parser uses Earley's representation of parse forests The term dependent on the grammar in the time complexity of the BU-LC unification-based parser described above is O C 2|R|3 where |C|is the number of categories implicit in the grammar, and |R the number of rules To avoid this complexity, the CE parser employs a table construction method which ensures that the number of states in the parse table is linearly related to the size of the grammar, resulting in the number of operations performed by the parser being at worst a polynomial function of grammar size To assess the practical performance of the three unification-based parsers described above, a series of experiments were conducted using the ANLT grammar (Grover, Carroll Briscoe, 1993 a wide-coverage grammar of English Parsing uses fixed-arity term unification The ANLT grammar also failed to parse three of these, plus an additional four Table 1 shows the total parse times and storage allocated for the BU-LC parser, the LR parser, and the CE parser, all with ANLT grammar and lexicon Table 1 also shows the results for the CLE parser with the CLARE25 grammar and lexicon Moore Dowding, 1991  The throughput of the CE parser is half that of the LR parser, and also less than that of the BU-LC parser Given that the ANLT and CLARE2
