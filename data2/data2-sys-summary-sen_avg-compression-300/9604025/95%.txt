 In a cascading word- POS guesser is described In this evaluation we used the cascading application of prefix rules, suffix rules and ending-guessing rules as described in  It applies first morphological prefix and suffix guessing rules and then ending-guessing rules There are two kinds of word-guessing rules employed by the cascading guesser: morphological rules and ending guessing rules Simple concatenative rules, however, are not necessarily regular morphological rules and quite often they capture other non-linear morphological dependencies Morphological word-guessing rules describe how one word can be guessed given that another word is known In English, as in many other languages, morphological word formation is realised by affixation: prefixation and suffixation, so there are two kinds of morphological rules: suffix rules (A[s rules which are applied to the tail of a word, and prefix rules (A[p rules which are applied to the beginning of a word Unlike morphological guessing rules, ending-guessing rules do not require the main form of an unknown word to be listed in the lexicon Using the technique described above and the lexicon derived from the Brown Corpus we extracted prefix morphological rules (no alterations suffix morphological rules without alterations and ending guessing rules, exactly as it was done in
