 Then we measured whether suffix rules with alterations (A) add any improvement if they are used in conjunction with the ending-guessing rules In a cascading word- POS guesser is described The task of unknown word guessing is, however, a subtask of the overall part-of-speech tagging process In this evaluation we used the cascading application of prefix rules, suffix rules and ending-guessing rules as described in  It applies first morphological prefix and suffix guessing rules and then ending-guessing rules Thus simple concatenative rules naturally became a subset of the mutative rules - they can be seen as mutative rules with the zero mutation, i There are two kinds of word-guessing rules employed by the cascading guesser: morphological rules and ending guessing rules Simple concatenative rules, however, are not necessarily regular morphological rules and quite often they capture other non-linear morphological dependencies Morphological word-guessing rules describe how one word can be guessed given that another word is known The additional rule-set of suffix rules with one letter mutation caused some further improvement In English, as in many other languages, morphological word formation is realised by affixation: prefixation and suffixation, so there are two kinds of morphological rules: suffix rules (A[s rules which are applied to the tail of a word, and prefix rules (A[p rules which are applied to the beginning of a word Unlike morphological guessing rules, ending-guessing rules do not require the main form of an unknown word to be listed in the lexicon Not surprisingly, morphological guessing rules are more accurate than ending-guessing rules but their lexical coverage is more restricted, i So we thought that the incorporation of a set of guessing rules which can capture morphological word dependencies with letter alterations should extend the lexical coverage of the morphological rules and hence might contribute to the overall guessing accuracy Brill outlines a transformation-based learner which learns guessing rules from a pre-tagged training corpus A statistical-based suffix learner is presented in  Thus sets of morphological guessing rules together with their calculated frequencies are produced For example, if a guessing rule strips a particular suffix and a current word from the corpus does not have such suffix we classify these word and rule as incompatible and the rule as not applicable to that word In a system of rules which uses both ending-guessing and more morphologically motivated rules is described Using the technique described above and the lexicon derived from the Brown Corpus we extracted prefix morphological rules (no alterations suffix morphological rules without alterations and ending guessing rules, exactly as it was done in
