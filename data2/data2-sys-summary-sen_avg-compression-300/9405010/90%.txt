 In this section we review the relevant facts for two such forms of ellipsis, namely gapping and VP-ellipsis, and also compare these with facts concerning non-elliptical event reference In contrast, Coherent Situation inference utilizes only the sentential-level semantic forms as is required for abducing a coherent situation Gapping is characterized by an antecedent sentence (henceforth called the source sentence) and the elision of all but two constituents (and in limited circumstances, more than two constituents) in one or more subsequent target sentences, as exemplified in sentence ( Bill became upset, and Hillary angry Empty constituents in the syntax are not in themselves referential, but are recovered during Common Topic inference Anaphoric expressions in the semantics are independently referential and are resolved through purely semantic means regardless of the type of discourse inferencee Common Topic) meaning of and: Bill became upset, and Hillary angry # Bill became upset, Hillary angry Bill became upset, and Hillary became angry We have also described two forms of discourse inference, namely Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference The interaction between the two features and the two types of discourse inference predicts facts concerning gapping, VP-ellipsis, event reference, and interclausal coherence for which it is otherwise difficult to account In fact, it appears that gapping is felicitous in those constructions where VP-ellipsis requires a syntactic antecedent, whereas gapping is infelicitous in cases where VP-ellipsis requires only a suitable semantic antecedent Figure shows the representations for the sentence Bill became upset; this will serve as the initial source clause representation for the examples that follow In Section 3, we categorize elliptical and event referential forms according to two features: (1) whether the expression leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax, and (2) whether the expression is anaphoric in the semantics The semantics for this embedded sentence is the open proposition that the two clauses share Like gapping, VP-ellipsis results in an empty constituent in the syntax, in this case, a verb phrase However, unlike gapping, VP-ellipsis also results in an independently anaphoric form in the semantics In Section 4 we describe two types of discourse inference, namely Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference, and make a specific proposal concerning the interface between these and the syntactic and semantic representations they utilize Therefore, such forms are anaphoric in the semantics, but do not leave behind an empty constituent in the syntax Here we describe two types of inference used to enforce the constraints that are imposed by coherence relations Examples of these relations are given in sentences (  (Parallel) John supported Clinton, but Mary supported Bush (Result) Bill is dishonest because he's a politician
