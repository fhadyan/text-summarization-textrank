 In this section we review the relevant facts for two such forms of ellipsis, namely gapping and VP-ellipsis, and also compare these with facts concerning non-elliptical event reference To reiterate the crucial observation, Common Topic inference utilizes the syntactic structure in identifying the semantics for the sub-sentential constituents to serve as arguments to the coherence constraints In contrast, Coherent Situation inference utilizes only the sentential-level semantic forms as is required for abducing a coherent situation Given that the discourse inference mechanisms retrieve semantic forms through nodes in the syntax, this syntax will have to be recovered when a node being accessed is missing Gapping is characterized by an antecedent sentence (henceforth called the source sentence) and the elision of all but two constituents (and in limited circumstances, more than two constituents) in one or more subsequent target sentences, as exemplified in sentence ( Bill became upset, and Hillary angry In previous sections, we have classified several elliptical and event referential forms as to whether they leave behind an empty constituent in the syntax and whether they are anaphoric in the semantics Empty constituents in the syntax are not in themselves referential, but are recovered during Common Topic inference Anaphoric expressions in the semantics are independently referential and are resolved through purely semantic means regardless of the type of discourse inferencee Common Topic) meaning of and: Bill became upset, and Hillary angry # Bill became upset, Hillary angry We therefore might predict that stripping is also acceptable in Common Topic constructions but not in Coherent Situation constructions, which appears to be the case: Bill became upset, Hillary Therefore, VP-ellipsis is predicted to require a suitable syntactic antecedent in these scenarios In Coherent Situation constructions, the empty VP node is not reconstructed In these cases the anaphoric expression is resolved on purely semantic grounds; therefore VP-ellipsis is only constrained to having a suitable semantic antecedent In the previous account these cases are all classified as non-parallel, resulting in the prediction that they only require semantic source representations Bill became upset, and Hillary became angry In Kehler , we presented an analysis of VP-ellipsis that distinguished between two types of relationship between clauses, parallel and non-parallel First, it no longer needs to be posited that syntactic representations disappear when integrated into the discourse model; instead, syntactic and semantic representations co-exist In this paper, we have categorized several forms of ellipsis and event reference according to two features: (1) whether the form leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax, and (2) whether the form is anaphoric in the semantics We have also described two forms of discourse inference, namely Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference The interaction between the two features and the two types of discourse inference predicts facts concerning gapping, VP-ellipsis, event reference, and interclausal coherence for which it is otherwise difficult to accountg considering either syntax, semantics, or discourse in isolation) have failed to account for all of the data VP-ellipsis is characterized by an initial source sentence, and a subsequent target sentence with a bare auxiliary indicating the elision of a verb phrase: Bill became upset, and Hillary did too In fact, it appears that gapping is felicitous in those constructions where VP-ellipsis requires a syntactic antecedent, whereas gapping is infelicitous in cases where VP-ellipsis requires only a suitable semantic antecedent In this section we characterize the forms being addressed in terms of two features: (1) whether the form leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax, and (2) whether the form is anaphoric in the semantics Figure shows the representations for the sentence Bill became upset; this will serve as the initial source clause representation for the examples that follow In source clauses of gapping constructions, constituents in the source that are parallel to the overt constituents in the target are abstracted out of the clause representation In Section 3, we categorize elliptical and event referential forms according to two features: (1) whether the expression leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax, and (2) whether the expression is anaphoric in the semantics The semantics for this embedded sentence is the open proposition that the two clauses share This semantics, we claim, can only be recovered by copying the syntax, as gapping does not result in an independently anaphoric expression in the semantics Like gapping, VP-ellipsis results in an empty constituent in the syntax, in this case, a verb phrase However, unlike gapping, VP-ellipsis also results in an independently anaphoric form in the semantics In Section 4 we describe two types of discourse inference, namely Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference, and make a specific proposal concerning the interface between these and the syntactic and semantic representations they utilize Therefore, such forms are anaphoric in the semantics, but do not leave behind an empty constituent in the syntax In the section that follows we outline two types of discourse inference, one of which requires such restoration of empty constituents To be coherent, utterances within a discourse segment require more than is embodied in their individual syntactic and semantic representations alone; additional inter-utterance constraints must be met Here we describe two types of inference used to enforce the constraints that are imposed by coherence relations (Parallel) John supported Clinton, but Mary supported Bush (Result) Bill is dishonest because he's a politician
