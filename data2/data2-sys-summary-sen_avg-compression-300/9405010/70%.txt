 In this section we review the relevant facts for two such forms of ellipsis, namely gapping and VP-ellipsis, and also compare these with facts concerning non-elliptical event reference To reiterate the crucial observation, Common Topic inference utilizes the syntactic structure in identifying the semantics for the sub-sentential constituents to serve as arguments to the coherence constraints In contrast, Coherent Situation inference utilizes only the sentential-level semantic forms as is required for abducing a coherent situation Given that the discourse inference mechanisms retrieve semantic forms through nodes in the syntax, this syntax will have to be recovered when a node being accessed is missing Gapping is characterized by an antecedent sentence (henceforth called the source sentence) and the elision of all but two constituents (and in limited circumstances, more than two constituents) in one or more subsequent target sentences, as exemplified in sentence ( Bill became upset, and Hillary angry In previous sections, we have classified several elliptical and event referential forms as to whether they leave behind an empty constituent in the syntax and whether they are anaphoric in the semantics Empty constituents in the syntax are not in themselves referential, but are recovered during Common Topic inference Anaphoric expressions in the semantics are independently referential and are resolved through purely semantic means regardless of the type of discourse inferencee Common Topic) meaning of and: Bill became upset, and Hillary angry In the case of Common Topic constructions, the missing sentence in the target will be copied from the source, the sentential semantics may be derived, and the arguments to the coherence relations can be identified and reasoning carried out, predicting felicity In the case of Coherent Situation relations, no such recovery of the syntax takes place # Bill became upset, Hillary angry We therefore might predict that stripping is also acceptable in Common Topic constructions but not in Coherent Situation constructions, which appears to be the case: Bill became upset, Hillary In summary, gapping and related constructions are infelicitous in those cases where Coherent Situation inference is employed, as there is no mechanism for recovering the sentential semantics of the elided clause In the case of Common Topic constructions, a suitable syntactic antecedent must be reconstructed at the site of the empty VP node, with the result that the anaphoric expression takes on its accompanying semantics Therefore, VP-ellipsis is predicted to require a suitable syntactic antecedent in these scenarios In Coherent Situation constructions, the empty VP node is not reconstructed In these cases the anaphoric expression is resolved on purely semantic grounds; therefore VP-ellipsis is only constrained to having a suitable semantic antecedent In the previous account these cases are all classified as non-parallel, resulting in the prediction that they only require semantic source representations Bill became upset, and Hillary became angry In Kehler , we presented an analysis of VP-ellipsis that distinguished between two types of relationship between clauses, parallel and non-parallel It was posited that VP-ellipsis could access either propositional or discourse model representations: in the case of parallel constructions, the source resided in the propositional representation; in the case of non-parallel constructions, the source had been integrated into the discourse model First, it no longer needs to be posited that syntactic representations disappear when integrated into the discourse model; instead, syntactic and semantic representations co-exist Instead, two distinct factors have been separated out: the resolution of missing constituents under Common Topic inference is purely syntactic whereas the resolution of anaphoric expressions in all cases is purely semantic; the apparent dichotomy in VP-ellipsis data arises out of the interaction between these different phenomena In this paper, we have categorized several forms of ellipsis and event reference according to two features: (1) whether the form leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax, and (2) whether the form is anaphoric in the semantics We have also described two forms of discourse inference, namely Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference The interaction between the two features and the two types of discourse inference predicts facts concerning gapping, VP-ellipsis, event reference, and interclausal coherence for which it is otherwise difficult to accountg considering either syntax, semantics, or discourse in isolation) have failed to account for all of the data VP-ellipsis is characterized by an initial source sentence, and a subsequent target sentence with a bare auxiliary indicating the elision of a verb phrase: Bill became upset, and Hillary did too In a previous paper , five contexts for VP-ellipsis were examined to determine whether the representations retrieved are syntactic or semantic in nature In fact, it appears that gapping is felicitous in those constructions where VP-ellipsis requires a syntactic antecedent, whereas gapping is infelicitous in cases where VP-ellipsis requires only a suitable semantic antecedent In sum, the felicity of both gapping and VP-ellipsis appears to be dependent on the type of coherence relation extant between the source and target clauses In this section we characterize the forms being addressed in terms of two features: (1) whether the form leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax, and (2) whether the form is anaphoric in the semantics We illustrate the relevant syntactic and semantic properties of these forms using the version of Categorial Semantics described in Pereira  Figure shows the representations for the sentence Bill became upset; this will serve as the initial source clause representation for the examples that follow In source clauses of gapping constructions, constituents in the source that are parallel to the overt constituents in the target are abstracted out of the clause representation In Section 3, we categorize elliptical and event referential forms according to two features: (1) whether the expression leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax, and (2) whether the expression is anaphoric in the semantics The empty constituent is reconstructed by copying the embedded sentence from the source to the target clause, along with parallel trace assumptions which are to be bound within the target The semantics for this embedded sentence is the open proposition that the two clauses share This semantics, we claim, can only be recovered by copying the syntax, as gapping does not result in an independently anaphoric expression in the semantics Like gapping, VP-ellipsis results in an empty constituent in the syntax, in this case, a verb phrase However, unlike gapping, VP-ellipsis also results in an independently anaphoric form in the semantics Given the representation in Figure as the source, the semantics for the missing VP may be recovered in one of two ways The syntactic VP could be copied down with its corresponding semantics, from which the semantics for the complete sentence can be derived In Section 4 we describe two types of discourse inference, namely Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference, and make a specific proposal concerning the interface between these and the syntactic and semantic representations they utilize could be used for this purpose; in this case the sentence-level semantics is recovered without copying any syntactic representations Therefore, such forms are anaphoric in the semantics, but do not leave behind an empty constituent in the syntax Whereas anaphoric forms in the semantics for these forms are independently resolved, empty syntactic constituents in and of themselves are not anaphoric, and thus may only be restored when some independently-motivated process necessitates it In the section that follows we outline two types of discourse inference, one of which requires such restoration of empty constituents To be coherent, utterances within a discourse segment require more than is embodied in their individual syntactic and semantic representations alone; additional inter-utterance constraints must be met Here we describe two types of inference used to enforce the constraints that are imposed by coherence relations In each case, arguments to coherence relations take the form of semantic representations retrieved by way of their corresponding node(s) in the syntax; the operations performed on these representations are dictated by the nature of the constraints imposed (Parallel) John supported Clinton, but Mary supported Bush Bill is a politician, and therefore he's dishonest (Result) Bill is dishonest because he's a politician
