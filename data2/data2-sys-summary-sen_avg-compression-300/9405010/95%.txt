 In contrast, Coherent Situation inference utilizes only the sentential-level semantic forms as is required for abducing a coherent situation Gapping is characterized by an antecedent sentence (henceforth called the source sentence) and the elision of all but two constituents (and in limited circumstances, more than two constituents) in one or more subsequent target sentences, as exemplified in sentence ( Bill became upset, and Hillary angrye Common Topic) meaning of and: Bill became upset, and Hillary angry # Bill became upset, Hillary angry Bill became upset, and Hillary became angry We have also described two forms of discourse inference, namely Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference The interaction between the two features and the two types of discourse inference predicts facts concerning gapping, VP-ellipsis, event reference, and interclausal coherence for which it is otherwise difficult to account In fact, it appears that gapping is felicitous in those constructions where VP-ellipsis requires a syntactic antecedent, whereas gapping is infelicitous in cases where VP-ellipsis requires only a suitable semantic antecedent However, unlike gapping, VP-ellipsis also results in an independently anaphoric form in the semantics In Section 4 we describe two types of discourse inference, namely Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference, and make a specific proposal concerning the interface between these and the syntactic and semantic representations they utilize
