 We define a new grammar formalism, called D-Tree Grammars (DTG which arises from work on Tree-Adjoining Grammars (TAG)  A SIC is a finite set of elementary node addresses (ENAs  An ENA specifies some elementary d-tree , a component of and the address of a node within that component of  Each node of elementary d-trees has an associated sister-adjunction constraint (SAC  We then subsert this structure and the subject into the to adore d-tree We subsert the resulting structure into the seems clause by substituting its maximal projection node, labelled VP[fin: at the VP[fin: frontier node of seems, and by inserting the subject into the d-edge of the seems tree Now, only the S node of the seems tree (which is its maximal projection) is substitutable Finally, we subsert this derived structure into the claims d-tree by substituting the S node of seems at the S complement node of claims, and by inserting the object of adores (which has not yet been used in the derivation) in the d-edge of the claims d-tree above its S node We first subsert the to adore d-tree into the seems tree as above, by substituting the anchor component at the substitution node of seems We then subsert this derived structure into the claims tree by substituting the root of the subject component of to adore at the S node of claims and by inserting the S node of the seems d-tree as well as the object component of the to adore d-tree in the S S d-edge of the claims d-tree The derivation proceeds as follows We first subsert the embedded clause tree into the matrix clause treee of the predicate-argument and modification structure When comparing this derivation structure to the dependency structure in Figure , the following problems become apparent Vijay-Shanker points out that use of adjunction for clausal complementation in TAG corresponds, at the level of dependency structure, to substitution at the foot node of the adjoined tree Section briefly discusses DTG recognition algorithms A d-tree is a tree with two types of edges: domination edges (d-edges) and immediate domination edges (i-edges  When a d-tree is subserted into another d-tree , a component of is substituted at a frontier nonterminal node (a substitution node) of and all components of that are above the substituted component are inserted into d-edges above the substituted node or placed above the root node In the composed d-tree the component is substituted at a substitution node in  The SAtree for consists of a single node labelled by the elementary d-tree name for
