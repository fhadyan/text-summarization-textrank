 sentence-type constructions; 2 constituency constructions, e valency constructions (head+dependents and 4 substitution constructions (e We can hypothesize the existence of a universal grammar of constructions; e Similar arguments can be made for other types of constructions, e basic discourse constructions (cf The English constructions SV, SVO, SVOO, SVOC (subject-verb-object-complement  afternoon etc We view languages as collections of constructions which range from words to discourse We have seen how the same representation scheme can be used for different constructions As an example involving familiar constructions, consider conjunctions In our construction grammar the representation of constructions is closely coupled with a semantic taxonomy Thus, for instance, not only do we have an np construction, but also such constructions as np(place np(duration np(time np(time(hour etc In other words, the semantic hierarchy is reflected in the set of linguistic categories century Parsing with constructions differs a bit from syntactic parsing Second, semantic and pragmatic information is used during parsing Given that, note that a grammar of constructions can account for the ability of the language user to understand the meaning of novel sentences without separating the language into syntax, semantics and pragmatics We view construction grammars as representations of domain-independent linguistic knowledge for discourse constructions; and a non-lexicalist encoding of the grammar in a dictionary of constructions Regarding more exotic constructions, Fillmore et al (His grammar, however, does not include contextual information, nor handle dialogs Finally, we note that context, especially dialog context, changes the range of applicable constructions In Section 3 we describe the formalism of constructions; Section 4 presents examples of construction (from words to discourse  Section 6 contains an example of parsing with a construction grammar We claim that a linking of form, meaning and context is needed to accurately describe NL constructions, both standard and non-standard  In MINCAL, the grammar consists of about a hundred constructions and a few hundred lexical entries, and includes both sentential constructions and discourse constructions The components of the parser are: the parser itself, a lexicon, a set of constructions and a set of filters xdiary In general, taking the context into account during parsing allows the parser to focus on certain constructions rather than others, as well as to compute certain meanings more accurately The dependence of meaning on context is well known, e A grammar is a collection of constructions wrapping The context consists of a set of semantic and pragmatic constraints limiting the application of the construction The message describes the meaning of the construction, via a set of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic constraints We assume that the difference of form implies the difference of meanings of two constructions (cf For example, divides constructions into four types: 1
