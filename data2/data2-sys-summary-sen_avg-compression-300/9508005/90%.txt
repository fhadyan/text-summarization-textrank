 The matching mechanism is, so far, implemented on the Greek part, providing English translation proposals for Greek input sentences We tested the system on 8,000 sentences of the CELEX database One of 80 clusters (which accounts for the 1% of the number of the sentences of the corpus used) which resulted in 10,203 sentences (sentences or segments) in 2 iterations, and one of 160 clusters which resulted in 10,758 sentences in 2 iterations The system proposed translations for 232 sentences (segments or whole input sentences) in the former case and for 244 in the latter case The similarity metric applied to two sentences (by sentence from now on we will refer to both sentence and sub-sentence fragment) should indicate how similar the compared sentences are, and perhaps the parts of the two sentences that contributed to the similarity score Then, a similarity metric is devised, which reflects the similarity of two sentences, by combining the individual contributions towards similarity stemming from word comparisons The syntax-rule driven metrics try to capture similarity of two sentences at the syntax level are regarded as fws We should also take into account whether the fws appear in the same order in the two sentences, whether an extra (or a few) fws intervene in one of the two sentences, whether certain fws are missing  The outcome of the DP-algorithm is the similarity score between two vectors which allows for different lengths of the two sentences, similarity of different parts of the two sentences (last part of one with the first part of the other) and finally variable number of additions and deletions The score produced, corresponds to two coherent parts of the two sentences under comparison On the other hand, it is also highly probable that a given input sentence does not, as a whole, match a corpus sentence, but rather different parts of it match with segments belonging to different sentences in the corpus Providing whole sentences as translation proposals, having a part that matched with part of the input sentence, would perhaps puzzle the translator instead of help him (her  Sentences can, however, be quite long
