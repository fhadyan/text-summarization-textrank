 Then, the size of MU is the measure of what is -complexity of U Thus, the semantic what is -complexity of S is greater than the what is -complexity of T Similarly, we can compute the semantic complexity of ELIZA as Q-complexity And these numbers are closer to our intuitive understanding of the semantic complexity of the two sets We have shown how these two kinds of complexity measures distinguish between the two sets of sentences with at  In other words, the real complexity of discussing a narrative is at least the complexity of iterated-what-is combined with iterated-why (and might as well include alternative questions  What is -complexity: A natural language understanding system has to deal with a set of basic objects Namely, what is -complexity and twice-iterated-what-is -complexity measures the size of the database of background knowledge facts Intuitively, this is a reasonable measure of their semantic complexity Complexity of grammatical constructions: In many cases the complexity of a new construction is not much greater than the complexity of the subconstructions they are built from Thus, roughly, the complexity of the grammar can be estimated by the number of grammatical constructions, defaults and filters One can of course argue about the adequacy of either model, but the fact remains that for simple tasks dialog complexity is limited by a small number of basic states We have defined semantic complexity by connecting the concept of Kolmogorov complexity with the types of questions that can apply to a sentence (a string  an abstract machine for answering questions of interest (2) Can we estimate semantic complexities by statistical means? This is possible for some cases of what-is -complexity, e (3) Can we express semantic complexity of a NLU task as a function of the complexity of an automaton partially solving the task and the description (or a corpus) of the whole task Acknowledgments Kanevsky for our discussions of semantic complexity, and W Secondly, they have a similar number of background knowledge facts One of the tools for measuring complexity widely used in theoretical computer science is Kolmogorov complexity We could define semantic complexity of a set of sentences S as its Kolmogorov complexity, i Let Q be a set of questions We can measure the semantic complexity of a set of sentences by the size of the smallest model that answers all relevant questions about those sentences (in practice, the simplest we are able to construct  A simple classification of questions given by (pp We now want to examine a few measures of semantic complexity: yes/no-complexity, and what is -complexity We also analyze the complexity of ELIZA as Q-complexity, and argue that defining semantic complexity of NL interfaces as Q-complexity makes sense If we measure the semantic complexity by the number of pairs in the functions, the yes-no complexities of both sets are the same and equal 24[2
