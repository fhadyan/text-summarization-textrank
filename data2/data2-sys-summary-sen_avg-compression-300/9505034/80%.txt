 Examples such as They saw her duck are a clear case of deliberate ambiguity; the whole point of these examples is to show that a sentence can have more than one interpretation This interpretation is sometimes suggested by the context, sometimes by means of disambiguation markers expressions such as each, a different, or the same that suggest which interpretation is preferred I will call the situation in which a listener arrives at more than one interpretation for an utterance perceived ambiguity Humans entertain more than one interpretation at a time, and they may not be able to choose one among them A preliminary and, I hope, uncontroversial conclusion I intend to draw from the discussion on deliberate ambiguity and ambiguity processing is that a theory of ambiguity that aims at explaining the Combinatorial Explosion Puzzle needs to be concerned both with the interpretation that the grammar assigns to a sentence i On the one hand, the theory must explain why the disambiguation process will not generate all semantically available interpretations; on the other hand, it must predict that more than one interpretation will be generated The discussion of perceived ambiguity supports a stronger claim, namely, that semantic ambiguity and perceived ambiguity are distinct notions, in the sense that whereas a model of semantic ambiguity has to express the truth-conditional properties of an expression, the reasoning processes involved in disambiguation, and that may lead to a perceived ambiguity, consist of defeasible inferences that are not supported by the semantics of ambiguous expressions The grammar assigns to an ambiguous expression of distinct expressions of , each of which has a unique interpretation Many systems, instead, make use of heuristic methods that generate only one interpretation and ignore the alternatives These representations `encode' the ambiguity of a sentence in the sense that that sentence has the reading r iff that reading can be generated by repeatedly applying `construction rules' to the underspecified representation The theory of ambiguity proposed in this paper is the basis for the implemented surface discourse interpretation system -93, used in the -93 demo system I will call this assumption the Underspecification Hypothesis: Underspecification Hypothesis : Human beings represent semantic ambiguity implicitly by means of underspecified representations that leave some aspects of interpretation unresolved My goal in the rest of the paper is to spell out the Underspecification Hypothesis both as a theory of grammar and as a theory of discourse interpretation I present in this section a theory of grammar which makes use of an underspecified language to encode the `ambiguity potential' of lexically ambiguous expressions, as well as a simple formalization of lexical disambiguation as defeasible inference over underspecified representations Lexical ambiguity is the one case of ambiguity for which a `generate and test' strategy may well be compatible with the psychological results, therefore the one for which the need for underspecified representations is less clear Discussing lexical disambiguation, however, is the simplest way to explain how underspecified representations can be given a semantics related to Pinkal's proposals about ambiguity, and how to defeasible reasoning with underspecified representations Furthermore, at least one theory of lexical disambiguation, Hirst's proposal , makes use of `Polaroid words' which are essentially underspecified interpretations of lexical items The presentation of a lexically underspecified grammar below is centered on the example of (H-type) lexical ambiguity discussed above, the verb croak, which can take two precisifications The interpretation function for , , is defined as follows The interpretation function assigns to an expression of a value with respect to M and a discourse situation d The latter expressions provide the interpretation for ambiguous expressions of  This makes the sentence indefinite in Pinkal's sense Even when subjects are able to pass judgments about what follows from an ambiguous sentence, it's arguable that they do not give judgments concerning what follows from the underspecified representation: rather, they first generate one interpretation, then decide what follows from that Discourse Interpretation and Perceived Ambiguity A theory of ambiguity processing solves the Combinatorial Explosion Puzzle if it does not require that all distinct interpretations of a semantically ambiguous sentence are actually generated A grammar consistent with the Underspecification Hypothesis such as the one just discussed moves us one step towards that goal, since it only imposes the constraint that a single underspecified interpretation be generated On the other hand, we can conclude from the discussion of deliberate ambiguity and of the psychological work on ambiguity that a psychologically plausible theory of ambiguity must also predict that more than one interpretation may become available in a given context, although the number of such interpretations will in general be much smaller than the number of possible semantic interpretations I will formalize discourse interpretation as the process of generating the extensions of the theory (DI,UF where DI the Discourse Interpretation Principles are default inference rules, and UF is a set of expressions of an underspecified language like  The Discourse Interpretation Principles formalize the defeasible inferences that take place in discourse interpretation, such as disambiguating inferences A default theory always has an extension as long as all defaults are normal, but it may have more than one extension if the set of Discourse Interpretation Principles contains two inference rules that both apply but generate a conflict Consider, for example, the default theory consisting of a set of discourse interpretation principles DI that includes, in addition to CROAK1-IF-FROG, a second discourse interpretation principle (let's call it CROAK2-IF-HUMAN-LIKE) stating that the croak2 interpretation is plausible for human-like beings; and of a set of wffs UF including the fact that Kermit is a human-like being this theory would have two extensions: Perceived ambiguity can now be redefined more precisely as the state that obtains when the default theory `encoding' the listener's discourse interpretation processes has more than one extension; and the cases of deliberate ambiguity discussed in section ambiguity_section can be formalized as cases in which the speaker has `reasoned about the other agent's reasoning as it were Once we start allowing discourse interpretation processes like those just discussed, the Underspecification Hypothesis is not sufficient to explain the Combinatorial Explosion Puzzle anymore The UH does not rule out a theory of discourse interpretation in which after an underspecified interpretation has been obtained, all possible senses of a sentence are generated In the framework for discourse interpretation just presented, theories of this kind could be formalized by including discourse interpretation principles that generate all the semantically justified interpretations at random For the case of lexical disambiguation, for example, we could have a theory that includes the two following inference rules: A theory of lexical disambiguation of this kind would simply produce all semantically justified interpretations of a sentence, and the Combinatorial Explosion Puzzle would remain a puzzle To solve the puzzle, a theory of disambiguation must therefore supplement the Underspecification Hypothesis with constraints on discourse interpretation that ensure that only a few extensions are generated For certain classes of ambiguity, including perhaps lexical ambiguity, the explanation may simply be that the disambiguation process is incremental, i For other classes of ambiguity, however, such as scopal ambiguity and referential ambiguity, incremental processing does not seem to be the solution, and different constraints must applye in which discourse interpretation principles like CROAK1-AT-RANDOM and CROAK2-AT-RANDOM are not allowed In order to illustrate more concretely the difference between theories of discourse interpretation that satisfy the Anti-Random Hypothesis, and theories that do not, let us consider how one could formalize a theory of pronominal interpretation A `random' theory of pronoun interpretation would go as follows: first, compute all possible antecedents of the pronoun in the discourse In contrast, centering theory is an example of non-random pronoun interpretation theory Examples of theories of definite description interpretation, tense interpretation, the interpretation of modals in discourse, and scope disambiguation that satisfy the Anti-Random Hypothesis are discussed in e not satisfied in every situation) as follows: Anti-Random Hypothesis A discourse interpretation theory (DI,UF) is Anti-Random iff for all discourse interpretation principles in DI, is not satisfied in every situation I will call this constraint Condition on Discourse Interpretation In first instance, the Condition on Discourse Interpretation might be formulated as follows, for the case of lexical ambiguity: Condition on Discourse Interpretation (Preliminary Each extension E of a discourse interpretation theory (DI,UF) must include, for each literal L in UF whose predicate is H-type ambiguous, a distinct disambiguating literal, i The definition of the Condition on Discourse Interpretation just given is not very general: it depends on the assumption that all cases of H-type ambiguity are originated by predicates A simpler, and more general, formulation of the Condition on Discourse Interpretation can be obtained by generalizing the format for the discourse interpretation principles once more But the purpose of discourse interpretation rules used for disambiguation, like CROAK1-IF-FROG, is to restrict the interpretation by eliminating certain readings I propose therefore to allow discourse interpretation principles to rewrite their `triggering wff' whenever this wff encodes an H-type ambiguity, in addition to adding new wffs to a set Whatever way we choose to define a H-type ambiguous wff, the Condition on Discourse Interpretation can now be formulated as follows: Condition on Discourse Interpretation : An extension E of a discourse interpretation theory (DI,UF) cannot contain an H-type ambiguous wff Notice that the statement of the Condition on Discourse Interpretation as a condition on pragmatic reasoning gives it the status of a felicity condition rather than of a hard constraint on interpretation In fact, each extension of a discourse interpretation theory under this new definition will, in general, be H-type ambiguous, some of the interpretations being inconsistent However, if we adopt the `rewriting' version of disambiguation discussed above, and impose the Condition on Discourse Interpretation, each extension will have a single interpretation, and therefore its consistency can be checked I propose therefore to define the notion of extension of a discourse interpretation theory as follows: Extension: A set of closed wffs E L is an extension for the discourse interpretation theory iff E is a fixed point of the operator and satisfies the Condition on Discourse Interpretation The theory of ambiguity introduced in the previous sections can be straightforwardly extended to obtain a treatment of two other classes of semantic ambiguity: scopal ambiguity and referential ambiguity These extensions preserve the basic ideas of the theory, semantic ambiguity as multiplicity of meanings, and perceived ambiguity as multiple extensions of a default theory; what changes is that on the one hand, a more complex underspecified language is introduced, capable of encoding other forms of ambiguity; on the other hand, more complex inference rules are used I will call the sentence constituents that modify the parameters of evaluation, and therefore affect the interpretation of other sentence constituents `in their scope operators As it is well-known, one cause of semantic ambiguity is that sentences may contain more than one operator, and their relative scope is not completely determined by the sentence's syntactic structure Historically, most underspecified representations have been introduced to deal with scopal ambiguity also includes lambda-abstracts and quantified expressions, defined below The model of interpretation for expressions is the triple , , I The interpretation function `I' assigns an interpretation to constants of type  The interpretation of variables is specified by the following clause: The interpretation of constants, connectives and application is as in  The denotation of the other expressions is discussed below Ambiguity `propagates up' as follows is a set: The interpretation of expressions of the form a is defined in a similar fashion, with the obvious semantics Having extended the language into one that can be used to describe scopal underspecification, the framework for discourse interpretation developed in section disc_int_section can also be used to formalize the inferences involved in scope disambiguation For example, one could formalize Ioup's Grammatical Function Principle, stating that an in subject position by default takes scope over s in other position, as follows: Logical forms in LFS are sentential expressions, and can therefore serve as triggering condition of discourse interpretation principles Yet another way in which the semantics of sentences is `underspecified' by their syntax is in the interpretation of anaphoric expressions and other expressions whose interpretation has to be fixed in context I propose that referential expressions are cases of semantic ambiguity, and translate into a special kind of underspecified object that I will call parameters This involves again using as interpretation function one that maps expressions into functions from assignments to meanings, as done for lambda-abstracts Referential ambiguity gets `resolved' by anchoring a parameter So, the discourse interpretation principles formalizing pronoun disambiguation involve a rewriting operation, just as the discourse interpretation principles formalizing lexical disambiguation But this fact about referential expressions also follows if we treat context dependence as a case of (H-type) semantic ambiguity; it is just a corollary of Pinkal's precisification imperative, from which I derived the Condition on Discourse Interpretation in section lexamb_section The one case of ambiguity that requires extending the framework introduced here considerably is syntactic ambiguity, as in They saw her duck I have suggested that to develop a theory of discourse interpretation that is consistent with what we know about the problem of ambiguity, we need to look both at the grammar and at discourse interpretation Pinkal does not equate ambiguity with vagueness I proposed a theory of grammar consistent with what I have called the Underspecification Hypothesis and which is not based on the assumption that all natural language expressions can be disambiguated; and a theory of discourse interpretation according to which a perceived ambiguity occurs when defeasible interpretation principles result in conflicting hypothesis The interpretation process is subject to two constraints: the Anti-Random Hypothesis (interpretations are not generated at random) and the Condition on Discourse Interpretation, derived from the Precisification Imperative (H-type ambiguity has to be resolved  In the theory, semantic ambiguity is characterized model-theoretically in terms of multiplicity of sense, whereas perceived ambiguity is characterized in terms of inference His theory includes, in addition to the notion of precisification, additional criteria to differentiate different forms of ambiguity, as well as differentiating `pure' ambiguity from `pure' vagueness Pinkal proposes that polysemous expressions behave like green, and calls all of these expressions P-type ambiguous; expressions like band, however, are true homonyms, and therefore he calls them H-type ambiguous To summarize, a sentence is H-type ambiguous iff the grammar assigns to it distinct precisifications (senses) in a given discourse situation, and if the `base level' of the expression requires precisification Although Pinkal is only concerned with lexical ambiguity, the precisification approach can also be used to classify as ambiguous sentences which have more than one structural analysis (like the sentence They saw her duck) or are scopally ambiguous (cfr the sentence Everybody didn't leave) whenever the grammar assigns to them more than one sense For example, has only one reading, even though (at least) two equivalent logical expressions can be obtained as the translation of the sentence Raskin, for example, claims that humor crucially relies on ambiguity
