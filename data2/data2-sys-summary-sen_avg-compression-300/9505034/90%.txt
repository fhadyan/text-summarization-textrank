 I will call the situation in which a listener arrives at more than one interpretation for an utterance perceived ambiguity Humans entertain more than one interpretation at a time, and they may not be able to choose one among them The discussion of perceived ambiguity supports a stronger claim, namely, that semantic ambiguity and perceived ambiguity are distinct notions, in the sense that whereas a model of semantic ambiguity has to express the truth-conditional properties of an expression, the reasoning processes involved in disambiguation, and that may lead to a perceived ambiguity, consist of defeasible inferences that are not supported by the semantics of ambiguous expressions The grammar assigns to an ambiguous expression of distinct expressions of , each of which has a unique interpretation The theory of ambiguity proposed in this paper is the basis for the implemented surface discourse interpretation system -93, used in the -93 demo system I will call this assumption the Underspecification Hypothesis: Underspecification Hypothesis : Human beings represent semantic ambiguity implicitly by means of underspecified representations that leave some aspects of interpretation unresolved I present in this section a theory of grammar which makes use of an underspecified language to encode the `ambiguity potential' of lexically ambiguous expressions, as well as a simple formalization of lexical disambiguation as defeasible inference over underspecified representations Lexical ambiguity is the one case of ambiguity for which a `generate and test' strategy may well be compatible with the psychological results, therefore the one for which the need for underspecified representations is less clear The interpretation function for , , is defined as follows The interpretation function assigns to an expression of a value with respect to M and a discourse situation d The latter expressions provide the interpretation for ambiguous expressions of  Discourse Interpretation and Perceived Ambiguity A theory of ambiguity processing solves the Combinatorial Explosion Puzzle if it does not require that all distinct interpretations of a semantically ambiguous sentence are actually generated I will formalize discourse interpretation as the process of generating the extensions of the theory (DI,UF where DI the Discourse Interpretation Principles are default inference rules, and UF is a set of expressions of an underspecified language like  The Discourse Interpretation Principles formalize the defeasible inferences that take place in discourse interpretation, such as disambiguating inferences Consider, for example, the default theory consisting of a set of discourse interpretation principles DI that includes, in addition to CROAK1-IF-FROG, a second discourse interpretation principle (let's call it CROAK2-IF-HUMAN-LIKE) stating that the croak2 interpretation is plausible for human-like beings; and of a set of wffs UF including the fact that Kermit is a human-like being The UH does not rule out a theory of discourse interpretation in which after an underspecified interpretation has been obtained, all possible senses of a sentence are generated In the framework for discourse interpretation just presented, theories of this kind could be formalized by including discourse interpretation principles that generate all the semantically justified interpretations at random For certain classes of ambiguity, including perhaps lexical ambiguity, the explanation may simply be that the disambiguation process is incremental, i For other classes of ambiguity, however, such as scopal ambiguity and referential ambiguity, incremental processing does not seem to be the solution, and different constraints must applye in which discourse interpretation principles like CROAK1-AT-RANDOM and CROAK2-AT-RANDOM are not allowed In order to illustrate more concretely the difference between theories of discourse interpretation that satisfy the Anti-Random Hypothesis, and theories that do not, let us consider how one could formalize a theory of pronominal interpretation A `random' theory of pronoun interpretation would go as follows: first, compute all possible antecedents of the pronoun in the discourse In contrast, centering theory is an example of non-random pronoun interpretation theory Examples of theories of definite description interpretation, tense interpretation, the interpretation of modals in discourse, and scope disambiguation that satisfy the Anti-Random Hypothesis are discussed in e not satisfied in every situation) as follows: Anti-Random Hypothesis A discourse interpretation theory (DI,UF) is Anti-Random iff for all discourse interpretation principles in DI, is not satisfied in every situation I will call this constraint Condition on Discourse Interpretation In first instance, the Condition on Discourse Interpretation might be formulated as follows, for the case of lexical ambiguity: Condition on Discourse Interpretation (Preliminary Each extension E of a discourse interpretation theory (DI,UF) must include, for each literal L in UF whose predicate is H-type ambiguous, a distinct disambiguating literal, i A simpler, and more general, formulation of the Condition on Discourse Interpretation can be obtained by generalizing the format for the discourse interpretation principles once more But the purpose of discourse interpretation rules used for disambiguation, like CROAK1-IF-FROG, is to restrict the interpretation by eliminating certain readings I propose therefore to allow discourse interpretation principles to rewrite their `triggering wff' whenever this wff encodes an H-type ambiguity, in addition to adding new wffs to a set Whatever way we choose to define a H-type ambiguous wff, the Condition on Discourse Interpretation can now be formulated as follows: Condition on Discourse Interpretation : An extension E of a discourse interpretation theory (DI,UF) cannot contain an H-type ambiguous wff In fact, each extension of a discourse interpretation theory under this new definition will, in general, be H-type ambiguous, some of the interpretations being inconsistent I propose therefore to define the notion of extension of a discourse interpretation theory as follows: Extension: A set of closed wffs E L is an extension for the discourse interpretation theory iff E is a fixed point of the operator and satisfies the Condition on Discourse Interpretation The theory of ambiguity introduced in the previous sections can be straightforwardly extended to obtain a treatment of two other classes of semantic ambiguity: scopal ambiguity and referential ambiguity Historically, most underspecified representations have been introduced to deal with scopal ambiguity The interpretation function `I' assigns an interpretation to constants of type  Ambiguity `propagates up' as follows Yet another way in which the semantics of sentences is `underspecified' by their syntax is in the interpretation of anaphoric expressions and other expressions whose interpretation has to be fixed in context This involves again using as interpretation function one that maps expressions into functions from assignments to meanings, as done for lambda-abstracts Referential ambiguity gets `resolved' by anchoring a parameter So, the discourse interpretation principles formalizing pronoun disambiguation involve a rewriting operation, just as the discourse interpretation principles formalizing lexical disambiguation The one case of ambiguity that requires extending the framework introduced here considerably is syntactic ambiguity, as in They saw her duck I have suggested that to develop a theory of discourse interpretation that is consistent with what we know about the problem of ambiguity, we need to look both at the grammar and at discourse interpretation Pinkal does not equate ambiguity with vagueness I proposed a theory of grammar consistent with what I have called the Underspecification Hypothesis and which is not based on the assumption that all natural language expressions can be disambiguated; and a theory of discourse interpretation according to which a perceived ambiguity occurs when defeasible interpretation principles result in conflicting hypothesis The interpretation process is subject to two constraints: the Anti-Random Hypothesis (interpretations are not generated at random) and the Condition on Discourse Interpretation, derived from the Precisification Imperative (H-type ambiguity has to be resolved  In the theory, semantic ambiguity is characterized model-theoretically in terms of multiplicity of sense, whereas perceived ambiguity is characterized in terms of inferencee if it requires precisification 86-87
