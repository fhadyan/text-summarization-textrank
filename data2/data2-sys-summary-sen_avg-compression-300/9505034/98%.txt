 The latter expressions provide the interpretation for ambiguous expressions of  Discourse Interpretation and Perceived Ambiguity A theory of ambiguity processing solves the Combinatorial Explosion Puzzle if it does not require that all distinct interpretations of a semantically ambiguous sentence are actually generated The Discourse Interpretation Principles formalize the defeasible inferences that take place in discourse interpretation, such as disambiguating inferences In contrast, centering theory is an example of non-random pronoun interpretation theory Examples of theories of definite description interpretation, tense interpretation, the interpretation of modals in discourse, and scope disambiguation that satisfy the Anti-Random Hypothesis are discussed in e not satisfied in every situation) as follows: Anti-Random Hypothesis A discourse interpretation theory (DI,UF) is Anti-Random iff for all discourse interpretation principles in DI, is not satisfied in every situation I will call this constraint Condition on Discourse Interpretation But the purpose of discourse interpretation rules used for disambiguation, like CROAK1-IF-FROG, is to restrict the interpretation by eliminating certain readings Whatever way we choose to define a H-type ambiguous wff, the Condition on Discourse Interpretation can now be formulated as follows: Condition on Discourse Interpretation : An extension E of a discourse interpretation theory (DI,UF) cannot contain an H-type ambiguous wff The interpretation function `I' assigns an interpretation to constants of type  Ambiguity `propagates up' as follows So, the discourse interpretation principles formalizing pronoun disambiguation involve a rewriting operation, just as the discourse interpretation principles formalizing lexical disambiguation Pinkal does not equate ambiguity with vagueness
