 Generative grammar and formal language theory share a common origin in a procedural notion of grammars: the grammar formalism provides a general mechanism for recognizing or generating languages while the grammar itself specializes that mechanism for a specific language These principles are simply properties of trees In terms of models, one can understand GB to define a universal language the set of all analyses that can occur in human languages Thus while universals in GB are properties of trees, in GPSG they tend to be properties of sets of trees The nature of language-theoretic complexity hierarchies is to classify languages on the basis of their structural properties The languages in a class, for instance, will typically exhibit certain closure properties (e Moreover, since these classifications are based on structural properties and the structural properties of natural language can be studied more or less directly, there is a reasonable expectation of finding empirical evidence falsifying a hypothesis about language-theoretic complexity of natural languages if such evidence exists Finally, the fact that these complexity classes have automata-theoretic characterizations means that results concerning the complexity of natural languages will have implications for the nature of the human language faculty Over time, the two disciplines have gradually become estranged, principally due to a realization that the structural properties of languages that characterize natural languages may well not be those that can be distinguished by existing language-theoretic complexity classes In this way, generative grammar in concert with formal language theory offers insight into a deep aspect of human cognition syntactic processing on the basis of observable behavior the structural properties of human languages Thus the insights offered by formal language theory might actually be misleading in guiding theories of syntax This full definition establishes that the theory we capture licenses a strongly context-free language Models for the language are labeled tree domains with the natural interpretation of the binary predicates Consequently, languages are definable in iff they are strongly context-free in the mildly generalized sense of GPSG grammars Since GPSG is presumed to license (roughly) context-free languages, we are not concerned here with establishing language-theoretic complexity but rather with clarifying the linguistic theory expressed by GPSG
