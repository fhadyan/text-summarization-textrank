 in the above, Gibson et al have manipulated number agreement to force low (12 middle (13) and high (14) attachment of the bracketed relative clause The search for the lowering site is of particular importance Gorrell restricts this constraint to Primary structural relations (i At the point where John knows the truth has been processed, a complete clause will have been built: (3) [S [NP1 John] [VP [V knows] [NP2 the truth The description will include the information that the verb knows precedes NP2, and that the VP dominates NP2 [S [NP1 John] [VP [V knows] [S2 [NP2the truth] [VP2 hurts Since the description before the processing of the disambiguating word hurts is a subset of the final tree description, the monotonicity requirement is satisfied Each lexical category is associated with a set of structural relations, which determine its lexical subtree We call this set the subtree projection of that lexical category {dom(S,NP dom(S,VP dom(VP,V dom(V,Lex prec(NP,VP Lexical categories are also associated with lists of left and right attachment sites In the above case, NP, (which will correspond to the subject of the verb will be unified with the left attachment site If a transitive verb is found in the input, then the parser consults the verb's argument structure and creates a new right attachment site for an NP, asserting also that this new NP is dominated by VP and preceded by V Simple attachment can be performed in two ways, which are defined below, where the term current tree description is intended to denote the the set of structural relations built up to that point in processing: Intuitively, left attachment may be thought of in terms of attaching the current tree description to the left corner of the projection of the new word, while right attachment corresponds to attaching the projection of the new word to the right corner of the current tree description DEFINITION Left Attachment: Let D be the current tree description, with root node R Let S be the subtree projection of the new word, whose left-most attachment site, A is of identical syntactic category as R DEFINITION Right Attachment: Let D be the current tree description, with the first right attachment site A (2) John knows the truth hurts We will call this operation tree-lowering  Intuitively, the operation finds a node on the current tree description which matches the left attachment site of the projection of the new word, and attaches it, while inserting the root of the new projection in its place In order to maintain structural coherence, the new word attached via tree-lowering must be preceded by all other words previously attached into the description We can guarantee this by requiring the lowered node to dominate the last word to be attached We also need to ensure that, to avoid crossing branches, the lowered node does not dominate any unsaturated attachment sites (or dangling nodes We therefore define accessibility for tree-lowering as follows: DEFINITION Accessibility: Let N be a node in the current tree description DEFINITION Tree-lowering: Let D be the current tree description Let S be the subtree projection of the new word The left attachment site A of S must match a node N accessible in D The attachment node A is unified with N In the case of example (2 at the point where the truth has been processed, the parser must find an accessible node which matches the category of the left attachment site of hurts (i The only choice is NP2: (3) [S [NP1 John] [VP [V knows] [NP2 the truth Now, all the local relations in which NP2 participates are found: {dom(VP,NP2 prec(V,NP2 and NP2 is substituted with the root of the new projection, S2 to derive two new relations: {dom(VP,S2 prec(V,S2 These relations are found to be licensed, because the verb which V dominates knows may subcategorise for a clause, so these new relations are added to the set Now, adding the subtree projection of hurts to the set, and unifying its left attachment site with NP2 results in the derived structure with NP2 subordinated into the lower clause [S [NP1 John] [VP [V knows] [S2 [NP2 the truth] [VP2 hurts With the tree-lowering operation so defined, the problem of finding which relations to add to the set at a disambiguating point reduces to a search for an accessible node at which to apply this operation NP1 and NP2 Note also, that, on standard X-bar assumptions, the attachment of post-modifiers may be derived via lowering at an X' node In this case, the lowered node and its replacement will be of the same syntactic category (like the root and foot node of a TAG auxiliary tree  This would suggest that a reasonable search strategy for English would be to search the set of accessible node in a bottom-up direction for English This means that arguments (which are incorporated via simple attachment) will be attached preferentially to adjuncts (which are incorporated via lowering  This captures the general preference for argument over adjunct attachment, which is accounted for by the principle of Minimal attachment in Frazier and Rayner (1982 and by the principle of simplicity in Gorrell (in press  John NOM essay ACC wrote student ACC praised John praised the student who wrote the essay Up to the first verb kaita wrote the string is interpretable as a full clause (without a gap meaning John wrote an essay and the incremental parser builds the requisite structure Inoue (1991 describes a minimal expulsion strategy which predicts a preference, on reanalysis, towards expelling the minimum amount of material from the clause In our terms, this means that (assuming a binary right-branching clause structure, with the verb in its right corner) the node selected for lowering must be as high as possible the verb of what will become the relative clause  Mazuka and Itoh (in press) note that examples where both subject and object must be expelled from the relative clause, as would be the first choice in a bottom-up search, often cause a conscious garden path effect
