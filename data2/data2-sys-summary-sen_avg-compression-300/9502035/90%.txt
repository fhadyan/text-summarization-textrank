 Simple attachment can be performed in two ways, which are defined below, where the term current tree description is intended to denote the the set of structural relations built up to that point in processing: Intuitively, left attachment may be thought of in terms of attaching the current tree description to the left corner of the projection of the new word, while right attachment corresponds to attaching the projection of the new word to the right corner of the current tree description DEFINITION Left Attachment: Let D be the current tree description, with root node R Let S be the subtree projection of the new word, whose left-most attachment site, A is of identical syntactic category as R DEFINITION Right Attachment: Let D be the current tree description, with the first right attachment site A (2) John knows the truth hurts Intuitively, the operation finds a node on the current tree description which matches the left attachment site of the projection of the new word, and attaches it, while inserting the root of the new projection in its place In order to maintain structural coherence, the new word attached via tree-lowering must be preceded by all other words previously attached into the description DEFINITION Tree-lowering: Let D be the current tree description The left attachment site A of S must match a node N accessible in D The attachment node A is unified with N In the case of example (2 at the point where the truth has been processed, the parser must find an accessible node which matches the category of the left attachment site of hurts (i an NP  Now, adding the subtree projection of hurts to the set, and unifying its left attachment site with NP2 results in the derived structure with NP2 subordinated into the lower clause NP1 and NP2 Note also, that, on standard X-bar assumptions, the attachment of post-modifiers may be derived via lowering at an X' node This would suggest that a reasonable search strategy for English would be to search the set of accessible node in a bottom-up direction for English the verb of what will become the relative clause
