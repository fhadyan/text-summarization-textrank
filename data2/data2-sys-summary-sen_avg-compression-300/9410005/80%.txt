 In the approach to discourse structure developed in and , a discourse exhibits both global and local coherence The backward center is a confirmation of an entity that has already been introduced into the discourse; more specifically, it must be realized in the immediately preceding utterance, Un-1 There are several distinct types of transitions from one utterance to the next These transitions describe how utterances are linked together in a coherent local segment of discourse See figure  Retaining may be a way to signal an intention to shift choice of grammatical function, syntactic structure, and type of referring expression (proper noun, definite or indefinite description, reflexive or personal pronoun, etc  RULES 1 Continuing is preferred over retaining which is preferred over shifting The part of the HPSG system that uses the centering algorithm for pronoun binding is called the pragmatics processor The semantics processor has access to information such as the surface syntactic structure of the utterance Reference markers also carry information about agreement and grammatical function This example is characterized by its multiple ambiguous pronouns and by the fact that the final utterance achieves a shift (see figure  A discourse segment consists of a sequence of utterances  The preferred ranking is shifting-1 (see figure  This extension enables us to successfully bind the she in the final utterance of the example in figure to Friedman The appendix illustrates the application of the algorithm to figure  With her extension, subject pronouns prefer subject antecedents and non-subject pronouns prefer non-subject antecedents With each utterance Un is associated a list of forward-looking centers, Cf(Un consisting of those discourse entities that are directly realized or realized by linguistic expressions in the utterance Because of rule 2, the interpretation in figure is preferred over the one in figure  The proposed anchors represent all the co-specification relationships available for this utterance The example we use to illustrate the algorithm is in figure  Ranking of an entity on this list corresponds roughly to the likelihood that it will be the primary focus of subsequent discourse; the first entity on this list is the preferred center, Cp(Un  This also holds for entities not directly realized in an utterance For some examples, particularly where Un contains a single pronoun and Un-1 is a retention, some informants seem to have a preference for shifting, whereas the centering algorithm chooses a continuation (see figure  There are other interesting questions concerning the centering algorithm
