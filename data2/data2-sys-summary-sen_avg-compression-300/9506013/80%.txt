 Nevertheless, for an automatic treatment of such inferences, we must give all the rules needed for reconstructing this natural reasoning and attempt to provide such a model, based on naive physics However, this is what K-context allows R to do F-context (factual context For this type of texts, there are two factual constraints bearing on the content of the text: - the text is a narration in which an accident takes place; - the text involves at least two participants, generally two vehicles, one of which is the author's This aspect of the texts is linked to E-context and the argumentative component in an accident report (A17)But this is not the case in , a text for which, if it was another type of narrative, we might imagine other endings to the incident (e but I was able to swerve and avoid it  We will see more instance of this in section , where we look at its argumentative effect The existence of the impact can then be deduced from a combination of several clues, some linguistic, some inferential The fact that car accidents usually involve two participants, most often two vehicles, is used to infer the identity of some entities in the texts or to establish coreference between two entities Indeed the authors often mix first person expressions with these neutral third person labels From R's point of view, resolving the problem of reference, i The road is a narrow, windy road, lined with trees Without the context that there should be two vehicles involved, the pronoun we would be surprising and probably uninterpretable Vehicle B arrived and hit my left side mirror with its right side mirror The second proposition introduces vehicule B, i the other vehicule involved in the accident In the third proposition, the reader encounters my left side mirror Indeed, without the knwoledge that W's vehicle is named A or B, there is no reason to identify vehicle A with it, even if vehicle A's role in the scene is then rather unclear However, with the knowledge of this convention, coreference can be resolved Louvet's vehicle It is rather small and thus the text must be rather short, at most one paragraph Nothing could allow foreseeing such icing conditions Louvet's vehicle and W's Nothing, except F-context, warrants linking vehicle B and Mrs Louvet's, and at first glance, there could appear to be three vehicles in this scene Louvet is the driver of vehicle B and that there are only two vehicles involved These goals are not contradictory and actually become intermingled They then try to speak the same language as the insurance agent and give exactly the information that the latter expects The argumentation may be explicit or left implicit For instance, in , the first two sentences set up in a very detailed way a situation which is specifically controlled by traffic rules Vehicle B was driving in the left lane reserved for vehicles going left (ground markings with arrows  It cut back in on my vehicle Of course, W has taken care to mention that his own vehicle was in the correct lane Since an accident has occurred, R may then deduce B's wrong behavior, which W then refers to explicitly at the end of the text At the same time, W takes care to insist on his own correct behavior (at moderate speed  (A11) The authors often express their own psychological states (e (17) b (A4) b and the road being wet, I wasn't able to stop completely in time The use of negation can also be a way of not mentioning explicitly the collision (see section  (18) I wasn't able to avoid the car which was coming with great speed Of course the two strategies are not mutually exclusive as shown by above (19) I was driving at about 45 km/h in a small one-way street where cars were parked on both sides Popping suddenly on my right coming out of a private building garage, Mrs We can thus formulate the rule that: In case of ambiguity, R should prefer the interpretation from which correct behavior on W's part can be inferred  It must therefore be the left blinker It must then be the right blinker, since the vehicle is in the right lane Arguments of the Maxims type must then be used In addition, the verb s'apprter can have several interpretations It can also have a more agentive interpretation and then it means to actively prepare for (22) Wanting to pass a hauler with its right blinker on, the latter turned left, forcing me to steer left to avoid it The car skidded on the wet pavement and struck a sidewalk then a fence straight ahead Whereas E-context and F-context are particular to this type of texts, K-context is independent of the type of texts: the knowledge involved will be the same whether the text is an accident report or a newspaper article and any text dealing with the road domain will invoke the same K-context The truck driver had indeed switched on his left blinker, but the trailer was inverting the signal to the right (A5) Instead of using an imperfective verbal form (i This lack of precision (or downright lie is intentional and allows W to try to lessen his responsibility This will succeed if R opts for a purely intentional reading of the verbal form If W was going to turn left, to mention checking to the right would be pertinent information for the insurance company since it would show that W had done everything required in such circumstances By selecting real occurring texts, instead of texts written to illustrate particular phenomena, and an homogeneous corpus of texts written in similar circumstances, we were able to focus on the characteristic properties of this text type and thus to better define the notion of context We have tried to show the importance of situational, cultural and textual presuppositions from the point of view of both the writer and the reader We have determined three types of context: K-context, the non-linguistic knowledge required for this domain, F-context, the more specific context of the events being narrated, and E-context, the discourse context for this text type (1) I was at a stop-sign with two cars in front of me turning to the right towards Mours Second, the reader uses the rule If X is at a stop-sign and X has switched his right blinker on, X will turn right to interpret with two cars in front of me turning to the right as The two cars were stopped and had switched their right blinker on rather than The two cars were turning right an interpretation which the present participle would allow Indeed, since W says that the two vehicles were turning right while in fact they were stopped, the expression turning right proves to be only an intention: the cars were stopped but they were going to turn right  check that no vehicle is coming I was driving between two lanes of stopped cars when one of the cars on my left opened its right front door This is crucial for determining what the entities mentioned in a text are, and can also be illustrated with , where R must determine that the two different expressions a vehicle arriving in front of me in the curve and the car which was coming with great speed are co-referent and thus that the text only involves two vehicles First, the two terms being used, vehicle and car, are compatible, indeed a car is a particular type of vehicle Second, in Western industrialized countries the most typical vehicle is a car, so without any other indication a vehicle is inferred to be, typically or by default, a car In , since W first uses the word vehicle to introduce an object, R infers that this vehicle is a car; this default conclusion is confirmed by the next expression the car which was coming with great speed a car The first interpretation induces a representation where there are three car lanes and vehicle A is in the middle one (which is moving while the second interpretation leads to the correct spatial representation, where there are only two car lanes and vehicle A is between them (4) b I was entering (vehicle A) the lane into a gas station (A17) b (A2) Metonymy is a general linguistic device, i Metonymy creates a unique discourse entity with properties coming from the elements being identified This metonymy allows transference of properties either from the driver to the car, e We show in section below the role played by metonymy in argumentation (5) b Vehicle B seemd to want to let vehicle A go through, (B42) b (A7) (6) b my bumper (A11) b
