 This is because in Japanese, noun phrases are not normally marked with respect to number First countability in English is discussed at the noun phrase and then the noun level Rules that translate the nouns with different noun countability preferences into other combinations of countable and uncountable are also possible For example, sometimes even fully countable nouns can be used in uncountable noun phrases Note that countable indefinite singular noun phrases without a determiner will have a/an generated Countable indefinite plural noun phrases and uncountable noun phrases may have some generated; a full discussion of this is outside the scope of this article As a noun phrase's countability in English is affected by its referential property (generic, referential or ascriptive) we present a method of determining the referential use of Japanese noun phrases0 noun phrases in each sentence For a sentence to be judged as correct all the noun phrases must be correct manmosu mammoth is fully countable so the generic noun phrase is translated as a bare plural Next the process of actually determining noun phrase countability and number is described The old version recognizes that a denumerated noun phrase headed by an uncountable noun tofu requires a classifier but does not generate the correct structure neither does it generate a classifier for the pluralia tanta scissors The biggest problem is noun phrases requiring world knowledge that cannot be expressed as a dictionary default These noun phrases cannot be generated correctly by the purely heuristic methods proposed here The last problem is noun phrases whose countability and number can be deduced from information in other sentences This method uses the information available in the original Japanese sentence along with information about English countability at both the noun phrase and noun level that can be stored in Japanese to English transfer dictionaries We adopt the definition of countability in English given in e the NP reference is quantified by the denumerator as a number of discrete entities Not all nouns in English can become the head of a countable noun phrase In particular, noun phrases whose heads fall within the scope of a denumerator denumerated' noun phrases) must be headed by a noun that has both singular and plural forms The classifier becomes the head of a countable noun phrase with the original noun attached as the complement of a prepositional phrase headed by of: a pair of scissors, a piece of equipment Whether a noun can be used to head a countable noun phrase or not depends both on how it is interpreted, and on its inherent countability preference Noun countability preferences are discussed in the next section Between these two extremes there are a vast number of nouns, such as cake, that can be used in both countable and uncountable noun phrases In order to generate English correctly, it is necessary to know whether a given noun phrase is countable or uncountable and, if countable, whether it is singular or plural `Collective' nouns share all the properties of fully countable nouns Examples of the information about countability and number stored in the Japanese to English noun transfer dictionary are given in table  The information about noun countability preferences cannot be found in standard dictionaries and must be entered by an English native speaker Some tests to help determine a given noun's countability preferences are described in , which discusses the use of noun countability preferences in Japanese to English machine translation The first stage in generating the countability and number of a translated English noun phrase is to determine its referentiality We call noun phrases used to make general statements about a class generic; for example Mammoths are extinct The way generic noun phrases are expressed in English is described in Section  Ascriptive noun phrases are used to ascribe a property to something; for example Hathi is an elephant They normally have the same number and countability as the noun phrase whose property they are describing The process of determining the referentiality of a noun phrase is shown in Figure  Tests a show two more heuristic methods for determining whether a noun phrase has generic reference A generic noun phrase (with a countable head noun) can generally be expressed in three ways  These combinations are shown in Table , noun phrases that can not be used to show generic reference are marked  Because the use of GEN is acceptable in all contexts, ALT-J/E generates all generic noun phrases as such, that is as bare noun phrases The number of the noun phrase is then determined by the countability preference of the noun phrase heading it Fully countable nouns and pluralia tanta will be plural, all others are singular The following discussion deals only with referential and ascriptive noun phrases as generic noun phrases were discussed in Section , The definitions of noun phrase countability given in Section , while useful for analyzing English, are not sufficient for translating from Japanese to English The process of determining a noun phrase's countability and number is shown in Figure  Noun phrases modified by Japanese/English pairs that are translated as denumerators we call denumerated For example a noun modified by onoono-no each is denumerated - singular, while one modified by ryouhou-no both is denumerated - plural Ascriptive noun phrases whose subject is countable will also be denumerated Weakly countable nouns will only be countable if used with a denumerator Sometimes the choice of the English translation of a modifier will depend on the countability of the noun phrase
