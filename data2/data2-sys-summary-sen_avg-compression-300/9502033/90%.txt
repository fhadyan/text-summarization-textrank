 The proposed procedure is based on successive calls to the anaphora module and to the PP attachment module To summarize the algorithm is: 1) Apply the anaphora module firstg (Carter, 1986; Reinhart, 1983; Sidner, 1983  2) Apply the PP attachment procedure 3) If some anaphora are left unresolved, apply the anaphora module again In this case the anaphora module can be applied before the attachment procedure The attachment of both PPs is then skipped The anaphora module pertains to the recent methods, uses a set of resolution rules based on the focusing approach, see (Sidner, 1983
