 Several methods have been proposed to deal with anaphora resolution and prepositional phrase (PP) attachment phenomenon and separately, so that the literature is very abundant : for PPs see e A detailed discussion about both procedures of anaphora resolution and PP attachment is largely developed in (Azzam, 1994  b) The anaphora procedure skips the resolution of a given anaphor when this anaphor is preceded by an unattached preposition The resolution of the anaphor is then postponed to the second phase of anaphora resolution The proposed procedure is based on successive calls to the anaphora module and to the PP attachment module The aim is to fill the unfilled roles in the CSs, due to anaphora or unattached PPs To summarize the algorithm is: 1) Apply the anaphora module firstg (Carter, 1986; Reinhart, 1983; Sidner, 1983  2) Apply the PP attachment procedure 3) If some anaphora are left unresolved, apply the anaphora module again 4) If there are still unattached PPs, apply the attachment procedure again In this case the anaphora module can be applied before the attachment procedure In this case, the resolution of the anaphora is postponed to a next call of the anaphora module according to principle b) stated above - The pronoun its can not be resolved by the anaphora resolution module because it is preceded by unattached PPs ; its resolution is skipped The attachment of both PPs is then skipped The algorithm should be considered as the splitting of both anaphora resolution and PP attachment procedures into several phases and not as the repetition of each procedure The attachment module has been implemented at 99  The anaphora module pertains to the recent methods, uses a set of resolution rules based on the focusing approach, see (Sidner, 1983  The disambiguation procedure aims at filling the empty roles using attachment rules
