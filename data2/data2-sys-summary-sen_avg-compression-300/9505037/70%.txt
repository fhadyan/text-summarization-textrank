 In a number of recent studies it has been shown that word translations can be automatically derived from the statistical distribution of words in bilingual parallel texts (e Starting from an English vocabulary of six words and the corresponding German translations, table and b show an English and a German co-occurrence matrix If now the word order of the English matrix is permuted until the resulting pattern of dots is most similar to that of the German matrix (see table then this increases the likelihood that the English and German words are in corresponding order Word n in the English matrix is then the translation of word n in the German matrix In this experiment, for an equivalent English and German vocabulary two co-occurrence matrices were computed and then compared The German vocabulary consisted of one by one translations of these words as chosen by Russell (1970  The word co-occurrences were computed on the basis of an English corpus of 33 and a German corpus of 46 million words The English corpus consists of the Brown Corpus, texts from the Wall Street Journal, Grolier's Electronic Encyclopedia and scientific abstracts from different fields To the knowledge of the author, the English and German corpora contain no parallel passages For each pair of words in the English vocabulary its frequency of common occurrence in the English corpus was counted The common occurrence of two words was defined as both words being separated by at most 11 other words The co-occurrence frequencies obtained in this way were used to build up the English matrix Equivalently, the German co-occurrence matrix was created by counting the co-occurrences of German word pairs in the German corpus As a starting point, word order in the two matrices was chosen such that word n in the German matrix was the translation of word n in the English matrix Regardless of the formula applied, the English and the German matrix were both normalized Starting from the normalized English and German matrices, the aim was to determine how far the similarity of the two matrices depends on the correspondence of word order The simulation was conducted by randomly permuting the word order of the German matrix and then computing the similarity s to the English matrix Figure shows for the three formulas how the average similarity between the English and the German matrix depends on the number of non-corresponding word positions c It could be shown that even for unrelated English and German texts the patterns of word co-occurrences strongly correlate Thereby, different sizes of the two matrices could be allowed for
