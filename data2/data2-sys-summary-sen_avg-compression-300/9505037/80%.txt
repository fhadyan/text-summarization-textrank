 This assumption is reasonable for parallel texts Starting from an English vocabulary of six words and the corresponding German translations, table and b show an English and a German co-occurrence matrix If now the word order of the English matrix is permuted until the resulting pattern of dots is most similar to that of the German matrix (see table then this increases the likelihood that the English and German words are in corresponding order Word n in the English matrix is then the translation of word n in the German matrix The German vocabulary consisted of one by one translations of these words as chosen by Russell (1970  The word co-occurrences were computed on the basis of an English corpus of 33 and a German corpus of 46 million words For each pair of words in the English vocabulary its frequency of common occurrence in the English corpus was counted The common occurrence of two words was defined as both words being separated by at most 11 other words Equivalently, the German co-occurrence matrix was created by counting the co-occurrences of German word pairs in the German corpus As a starting point, word order in the two matrices was chosen such that word n in the German matrix was the translation of word n in the English matrix Starting from the normalized English and German matrices, the aim was to determine how far the similarity of the two matrices depends on the correspondence of word order The simulation was conducted by randomly permuting the word order of the German matrix and then computing the similarity s to the English matrix It could be shown that even for unrelated English and German texts the patterns of word co-occurrences strongly correlate
