 The results were encouraging The translations were compared by checking how well the output Japanese sentence conveyed the meaning of the input English sentence The results of our experiments show the effectiveness of this method; moreover, implementation of this method on a machine translation system improved the accuracy of its translation Since most words in a sentence are repeatedly used in other sentences in the discourse, the complete parses of well-formed sentences usually provided some useful information for completing incomplete parses in the same discourse In the next section, the effectiveness of using information extracted from the discourse to complete syntactic analysis of ill-formed sentences In this experiment, we divided the original 736 sentences into two texts, one a discourse of 400 sentences and the other a discourse of 336 sentences9 of the 54 sentences Then, except for sentences with incomplete parses and multiple parses, the results of each parse are stored as discourse information In accumulating discourse information, a score of 1 After all the sentences except the ill-formed sentences that caused incomplete parses have provided data for use as discourse information, the parse completion procedure begins If they are different from those in the discourse information, the partial parse is restructured according to the discourse information1) Fig In the second partial parse, the word side is analyzed as a verb 3 and 12 (151st sentence) (33) Fig To examine the possibility of modification, discourse information is applied at three different levels Next, if there is no identical pattern, a modification pattern with a synonym of the node on one side is searched for in the discourse information We have implemented this method on an English-to-Japanese machine translation system called Shalt2 , and conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of this method However, the resulting unified parses were not always correct Since sentences with incomplete parses are usually quite long and contain complicated structures, it is hard to obtain a perfect analysis for those sentences The results are shown in Table
