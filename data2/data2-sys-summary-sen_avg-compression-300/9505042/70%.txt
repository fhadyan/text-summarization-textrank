 The results were encouraging The translations were compared by checking how well the output Japanese sentence conveyed the meaning of the input English sentence Since most unified parses contained various errors, such as incorrect modification patterns and incorrect parts of speech assigned to some words, fewer errors generally resulted in better translations, but incorrect parts of speech resulted in worse translations The results of our experiments show the effectiveness of this method; moreover, implementation of this method on a machine translation system improved the accuracy of its translation Since most words in a sentence are repeatedly used in other sentences in the discourse, the complete parses of well-formed sentences usually provided some useful information for completing incomplete parses in the same discourse In the next section, the effectiveness of using information extracted from the discourse to complete syntactic analysis of ill-formed sentences After that, we propose an algorithm for completing incomplete parses by using discourse information, and give the results of an experiment on completing incomplete parses in technical documents In this section, we use the word discourse to denote a set of sentences that forms a text concerning related topics This figure reflects the analysis of structurally ambiguous phrases in a computer manual consisting of 791 consecutive sentences for discourse sizes ranging from 10 to 791 sentences If the constituent words tend to be associated in identical modification patterns with an identical part of speech and identical modifiee-modifier relationship when an identical phrase (a set of consecutive words) is repeated in different sentences within the discourse, the candidate parse that shares the most collocation patterns with other sentences in the discourse should be selected as the correct analysis Out of 736 consecutive sentences in a computer manual, the ESG parser generated multiple parses for 150 sentences In this experiment, we divided the original 736 sentences into two texts, one a discourse of 400 sentences and the other a discourse of 336 sentences Of the 150 sentences with multiple parses, 24 were incorrectly analyzed in all candidate parses or had identical candidate parses; we therefore focused on the other 126 sentences Out of the 126 sentences, different preference values were assigned to candidate parses in 54 sentences, and the highest value was assigned to a correct parse in 48 (889 of the 54 sentences The sentences that contain some words in common with sentence (21) provide information that is very useful for deriving a correct parse of the sentence Underneath the candidate part of speech, repeated phases in other sentences are presented along with the part of speech of each word in those sentences; thus, the first word of sentence (2 As we showed in the previous section, information that is very useful for obtaining correct parses of ill-formed sentences is provided by complete parses of other sentences in the same discourse in cases where a parser cannot construct a parse tree by using its grammar rules In this section, we describe an algorithm for completing incomplete parses by using this information The procedure for extracting discourse information is as follows: 1 Each sentence in the whole text given as a discourse is processed by a syntactic parser Then, except for sentences with incomplete parses and multiple parses, the results of each parse are stored as discourse information Table shows an example of such information In accumulating discourse information, a score of 1 When all the sentences have been parsed, the discourse information is used to select the most preferable candidate for sentences with multiple possible parses, and the data of the selected parse are added to the discourse information After all the sentences except the ill-formed sentences that caused incomplete parses have provided data for use as discourse information, the parse completion procedure begins For example, the PEG parser generated three partial parses for sentence (2 Since partial parses are generated by means of grammar rules in a parser, we decided to restructure each partial parse and unify them according to the discourse information, rather than construct the whole parse tree from discourse information If they are different from those in the discourse information, the partial parse is restructured according to the discourse information For example, Figure shows an incomplete parse of the following sentence, which is the 43rd sentence in a technical text that consists of 175 sentences1) Fig In the second partial parse, the word side is analyzed as a verb 3 and 12 (151st sentence) (33) Fig 4 is an isometric view of the magazine taken from the machine side with one cartridge shown in the unprocessed position and two cartridges shown in the processed position Two partial parses are joined if the root (head node) of either parse tree can modify a node in the other parse without crossing the modification of other nodes To examine the possibility of modification, discourse information is applied at three different levels Next, if there is no identical pattern, a modification pattern with a synonym of the node on one side is searched for in the discourse information We have implemented this method on an English-to-Japanese machine translation system called Shalt2 , and conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of this method Table gives the result of our experiments on two technical documents of different kinds, one a patent document (text 1 and the other a computer manual (text 2  Starting from the viewpoint that an interpretation of a sentence must be consistent in its discourse, we worked on completing incomplete parses by using information extracted from complete parses in the discourse In both texts, the discourse information provided enough information to unify partial parses of an incomplete parse in more than half of the cases However, the resulting unified parses were not always correct Since sentences with incomplete parses are usually quite long and contain complicated structures, it is hard to obtain a perfect analysis for those sentences When the discourse information did not provide enough information to unify partial parses with the application of our method, the heuristic rules were applied The results are shown in Table
