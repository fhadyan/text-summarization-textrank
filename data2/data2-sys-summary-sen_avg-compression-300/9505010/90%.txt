 There are two contradicting requirements First experiments with tag clustering showed that, even for fully automatic identification of the original tag, tagging accuracy slightly increased when the reduced tagset was used the reduced tagset and the original tagset So, the original tag can be restored any time and no information from the original tagset is lost Maximize the tagging accuracy for a training corpus Compute tagging accuracy for the clustering part with the original tagset (b) For each candidate cluster build the resulting tagset and compute tagging accuracy for that tagset (d) Add the cluster which maximized the tagging accuracy to the tagset and remove the two tags previously used Output the resulting tagset Part A consists of about 127,000 words, part B of about 10,000 words, and part C of about 10,000 words Table shows the tagging results for known words Clustering reduced the tagset by 33 (third exp and 31 (fourth exp tags We have shown a method for reducing a tagset used for part-of-speech tagging without losing information given by the original tagset
