 the wise Cliff  Obviously, information useful for probability estimation is not encoded in the tagset This paper presents a way to modify a given tagset, such that categories with similar distributions in a corpus are combined without losing information provided by the original tagset and without losing accuracy The aim of the presented method is to reduce a tagset as much as possible by combining (clustering) two or more tags without losing information and without losing accuracy Incoming text will be disambiguated with the new reduced tagset, but we ensure that the original tag is still uniquely identified by the new tag First experiments with tag clustering showed that, even for fully automatic identification of the original tag, tagging accuracy slightly increased when the reduced tagset was used A crucial property of the reduced tagset is that the original tag information can be restored from the new tag, since this is the information we are interested in the reduced tagset and the original tagset Formally, seeing tags as sets of words and clusters as sets of tags: If this condition holds, then for all words w tagged with a cluster c, exactly one tag twc fulfills yielding forig(w, c) = twc So, the original tag can be restored any time and no information from the original tagset is lost Maximize the tagging accuracy for a training corpus The only additional effort is a separate, previously unused part of the training corpus for this purpose, the clustering part We combine those tags into clusters which give the best results for tagging of the clustering part Compute tagging accuracy for the clustering part with the original tagset (b) For each candidate cluster build the resulting tagset and compute tagging accuracy for that tagset (d) Add the cluster which maximized the tagging accuracy to the tagset and remove the two tags previously used Output the resulting tagset Then clustering was performed on the same data and tagging was done with the reduced tagset The reduced tagset was only internally used, the output of the tagger consisted of the original tagset for all experiments The Susanne Corpus has about 157,000 words and uses 424 tags (counting tags with indices denoting multi-word lexemes as separate tags  The tags are based on the LOB tagset  Part A consists of about 127,000 words, part B of about 10,000 words, and part C of about 10,000 words First, part A and B were used for training, and part C for testing Then, part A and C were used for training, and part B for testing Table shows the tagging results for known words In the third experiment, part A was used for trigram training, part B for clustering and part C for testing In the fourth experiment, part A was used for trigram training, part C for clustering and part B for testing Clustering reduced the tagset by 33 (third exp and 31 (fourth exp tags However, the tagset is reduced, thus also reducing the number of parameters without losing accuracy We have shown a method for reducing a tagset used for part-of-speech tagging without losing information given by the original tagset
