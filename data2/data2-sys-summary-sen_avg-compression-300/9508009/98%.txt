 These rules will be called expansion rules, since their application will invariably expand the tree structure Figure summarises the expansion rules to be employed by the system Given the expansion rules, the definition of the main data structure to be manipulated by the theorem proving (parsing) algorithm is straightforward: a derivation tree, , is simply a binary tree built from a set of given formulae by applying the rules Dependency Categorial Grammar as well as stronger calculi which extend the power of L through the addition of structural rules right dislocation,  The calculus defined above presents no negation, though
