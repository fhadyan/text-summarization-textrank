 That is, one would predict a clash of temporal relations for sentence ( since the simple pasts induce the forward progression of time but the conjunction indicates the reverse temporal ordering The second question arises from assuming that all temporal relations are recovered solely from reasoning with coherence relations Specifically, to account for the forward progression of time induced by successive simple past tenses in a narrative, they treat the simple past as referring to a time evoked by a previous past tensee past, present, or future) in relation to a discourse reference time tR For simple tenses tR is the speech time, and therefore simple tenses are not anaphoric The tenses used may not completely specify the implicit temporal relations between the described events In passage ( both the tense and the coherence relation order the times in backward progression The Narration relation orders the times in forward progression in passage ( ) and the Explanation relation orders them in backward progression in passage (  We have given an account of temporal relations whereby (1) tense is resolved indefinitely with respect to a possibly anaphorically-resolved discourse reference time, and (2) the resultant temporal relations may be further refined by constraints that coherence relations impose
