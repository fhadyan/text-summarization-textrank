 The left member of each pair is for the genetic search program, while the right member is for the annealing search program Observe that the annealing search program performs significantly better in all cases less significant bits This may explain the better convergence behaviour of the annealing search Again the annealing program fares better than the genetic program In fact, the annealing program never found an evaluation less than 3 while the genetic program never found an evaluation less than 4 Now, consider the following randomly generated sequence of tones: The annealing program was set the task of finding ten transcriptions of this tone sequence My trial-and-error approach will not necessarily have found optimal parameter values, and so it would be premature to conclude from the performance comparison that annealing search is better than genetic search for the problem of tone transcription I provided an F0 prediction function which estimated the F0 value of a tone, given the F0 value of the previous tone and the identities of the two tones The function was then incorporated into the evaluation functions of two implemented non-deterministic search algorithms The performance results were encouraging and demonstrate the promise of automated tone transcription a transcription  a tone transcription) given a sequence of n F0 values X The programs make crucial use of the prediction function in evaluating candidate tone transcriptions In the present context, say for a sequence of 20 tones, the search space contains possible tone transcriptions, and for each of these there are thousands of possible parameter settings, too large a search space for exhaustive search in a reasonable amount of computation time The best known such methods are genetic search and annealing search  In the following sections I describe a genetic algorithm and an annealing algorithm for the tone transcription problem In its early stages when the temperature is high, annealing search resembles random search Now there is much less free energy and so transitions to higher energy states are less and less likely Finally, we check if the new transcription is better than the best transcription found so far (BestTrans) and if so, we set BestTrans to be the new transcription Once equilibrium is reached, the current transcription is set to be the best transcription found so far, and the search continues
