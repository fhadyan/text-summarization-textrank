 less significant bits Again the annealing program fares better than the genetic program Now, consider the following randomly generated sequence of tones: The annealing program was set the task of finding ten transcriptions of this tone sequence a transcription  a tone transcription) given a sequence of n F0 values X The best known such methods are genetic search and annealing search  In its early stages when the temperature is high, annealing search resembles random search
