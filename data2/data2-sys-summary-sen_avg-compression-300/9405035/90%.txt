 Logogens in a verbal system are also interconnected with associative connections Lexical translation is an example of associative processing between two languages Lexical selection is the task of choosing target language words that accurately reflect the meaning of the corresponding source language words A common lexical selection practice involves an intermediate representation Several target language lexical entries may be selected for a single source language word An information-theoretical network has two layers We tried to map source language f-structures to target language f-structure in a connectionist transfer project  We replaced the back-propagation networks for lexical selection with information-theoretical networks simulating the associative process in the dual-coding theory The networks have two layers of units Each source (target) language lexical item is represented by a unit in the input (output) layer The lexical selection approach discussed here has two advantages The general dual-coding theory hypothesizes that human represents language with dual systems the verbal system and the imagery system
