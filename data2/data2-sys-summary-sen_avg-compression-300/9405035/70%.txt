 The elements of the verbal system are logogens for words in a language Logogens in a verbal system are also interconnected with associative connections The bilingual dual-coding theory proposes an architecture in which a common imagery system is connected to two verbal systems, and the two verbal systems are interconnected to each other via associative connections [Figure  Activation of associative connections between logogens is called associative processing Lexical translation is an example of associative processing between two languages Lexical selection is the task of choosing target language words that accurately reflect the meaning of the corresponding source language words A common lexical selection practice involves an intermediate representation It disambiguates the source language words to entities in the intermediate representation, then maps from the entities to the target lexical entries This intermediate representation may be Lexical Concept Structure or interlingua  Currently, there are some efforts in statistical lexical selection A target language word W can be selected with the posterior probability Pr(W W ) given the source language word W  Several target language lexical entries may be selected for a single source language word Then the correct selections can be identified by the language model of the target language  This approach is learnable In next subsections, we propose information-theoretical networks based on the bilingual dual-coding theory for lexical selection Information-theoretical network is a neural network formalism that is capable of doing associations between two layers of representations An information-theoretical network has two layers However, only the information-theoretical network is isomorphic to the directly interconnected verbal systems in the dual-coding theory We tried to map source language f-structures to target language f-structure in a connectionist transfer project  It provides a learnable lexical selection sub-system for a connectionist transfer project in machine translation finding the head of a target structure The second sub-task is a problem of lexical selection We replaced the back-propagation networks for lexical selection with information-theoretical networks simulating the associative process in the dual-coding theory The networks have two layers of units Each source (target) language lexical item is represented by a unit in the input (output) layer It then activates the lexical selection network for that phrasal category with the input units that correspond to the heads of the source language f-structure and its sub-structures Through the connections between the two layers, the output units are activated, and the lexical item that corresponds to the most active output unit is selected as the head of the target f-structure The accuracy of our system with information-theoretical network lexical selection is lower than the one with back-propagation networks (around 84% versus around 92 for the training data The information-theoretical networks do not over-learn as the back-propagation networks The lexical selection approach discussed here has two advantages The general dual-coding theory hypothesizes that human represents language with dual systems the verbal system and the imagery system
