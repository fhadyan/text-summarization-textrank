 The elements of the verbal system are logogens for words in a language The bilingual dual-coding theory proposes an architecture in which a common imagery system is connected to two verbal systems, and the two verbal systems are interconnected to each other via associative connections [Figure  Lexical translation is an example of associative processing between two languages Lexical selection is the task of choosing target language words that accurately reflect the meaning of the corresponding source language words A common lexical selection practice involves an intermediate representation It disambiguates the source language words to entities in the intermediate representation, then maps from the entities to the target lexical entries A target language word W can be selected with the posterior probability Pr(W W ) given the source language word W  Several target language lexical entries may be selected for a single source language word In next subsections, we propose information-theoretical networks based on the bilingual dual-coding theory for lexical selection An information-theoretical network has two layers We tried to map source language f-structures to target language f-structure in a connectionist transfer project  finding the head of a target structure We replaced the back-propagation networks for lexical selection with information-theoretical networks simulating the associative process in the dual-coding theory The networks have two layers of units Each source (target) language lexical item is represented by a unit in the input (output) layer It then activates the lexical selection network for that phrasal category with the input units that correspond to the heads of the source language f-structure and its sub-structures The accuracy of our system with information-theoretical network lexical selection is lower than the one with back-propagation networks (around 84% versus around 92 for the training data The lexical selection approach discussed here has two advantages The general dual-coding theory hypothesizes that human represents language with dual systems the verbal system and the imagery system
