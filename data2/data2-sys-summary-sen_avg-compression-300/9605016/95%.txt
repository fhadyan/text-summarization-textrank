 This completes the proof This inflexibility of Lambek Calculus is one of the reasons why many researchers study richer systems today The present paper studies the computational complexity of a variant of the Lambek Calculus that lies between LMBK and LP, the Semidirectional Lambek Calculus SDL The semidirectional Lambek calculus (henceforth SDL) is a variant of J Lambek's original calculus of syntactic types We start by defining the Lambek calculus and extend it to obtain SDL The (usual) formal framework of these logics is a Gentzen-style sequent calculus Figure shows Lambek's original calculus LMBK An SDL-grammar is defined exactly like a Lambek grammar, except that replaces  grammar to a categorial grammar G  Example We use primitive types and define the lexical map for as follows: The distinguished primitive type is x Suppose
