 The reduce rule that takes account of the interaction of a generic rule with a context-free grammar is The interaction with the generic rule is expressed in the term  The side conditions on this rule are: one, that exists an applicable syntactic rule  In such a rule, the role of every partial rule is similar to that of a context-free rule, and the generic rule works as a context-free grammar in which rules has a default interpretation The reduce rule that takes account of syntactic parsing with a generic rule can be described as follows: The expression , with both arguments repeated, may seem confusing Such partial rule is then applied to the second set of arguments For a generic rule, the reduce rule involves introducing a new type in the hierarchy of rules Consider the grammar made up of the following generic rules: The syntactic rule has already been considered in section  A phrase-structure grammar with a one-to-one correspondence between syntactic and semantic rules would need 12 pairs of rules to get the same behaviour as the two generic rules above Its reformulation as a generic rule will show the advantages of expressing default and exceptional grammar rules The framework of generic rules offers a natural way to express the grammar to deal with non-constituent coordination as an arrangement of default rules, where each combination of types is performed according to the most specific rule available is the rule to introduce a sequence product rule implements the stepped application of rules L/ and in the cancellation of type  is the rule to eliminate the tuple operator and it implements the rule The second partial rule is the rule of tuple formation We need two partial rules to establish both type specifications A set of such functions will be called a generic rule When reformulated as a generic rule, the type conditions on the arguments for each rule are used by the dynamic binding process to fire the most appropriate grammar rule at every parsing step Next, we make a more formal presentation of generic rules We present, then, a reformulation of that grammar as a generic rule Consider a context-free grammar - possibly augmented with functional restrictions attached to each rule - that includes the hierarchy and the rule  The generic rule having the desired behaviour for rule and rule has this aspect: Equation describes a generic rule, , that returns a type for the composition of two linguistic objects The applicable partial rules will be  We call cartesian type of a partial rule to the type specification  It interfaces parsing processes with the grammar, selecting the most specific partial rule in given two arguments of types  In particular, the dynamic binding function provides the default interpretation for partial rules A generic rule may interact with a phrase-structure grammar to perform the composition of some informational field We will gradually adopt this algorithm to capture generic rule parsing The reduce rule carries on semantic composition: where f is the semantic composition function associated to the rule  The action of the generic rule has to be specified through the dynamic binding function There is not a partial rule associated to each context-free rule
