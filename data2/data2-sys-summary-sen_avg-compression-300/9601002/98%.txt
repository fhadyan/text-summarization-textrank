 In such a rule, the role of every partial rule is similar to that of a context-free rule, and the generic rule works as a context-free grammar in which rules has a default interpretation For a generic rule, the reduce rule involves introducing a new type in the hierarchy of rules The second partial rule is the rule of tuple formation The generic rule having the desired behaviour for rule and rule has this aspect: Equation describes a generic rule, , that returns a type for the composition of two linguistic objects There is not a partial rule associated to each context-free rule
