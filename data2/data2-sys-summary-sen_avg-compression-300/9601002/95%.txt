 The reduce rule that takes account of the interaction of a generic rule with a context-free grammar is The interaction with the generic rule is expressed in the term  The side conditions on this rule are: one, that exists an applicable syntactic rule  In such a rule, the role of every partial rule is similar to that of a context-free rule, and the generic rule works as a context-free grammar in which rules has a default interpretation For a generic rule, the reduce rule involves introducing a new type in the hierarchy of rules Consider the grammar made up of the following generic rules: The syntactic rule has already been considered in section  Its reformulation as a generic rule will show the advantages of expressing default and exceptional grammar rules is the rule to introduce a sequence product is the rule to eliminate the tuple operator and it implements the rule The second partial rule is the rule of tuple formation When reformulated as a generic rule, the type conditions on the arguments for each rule are used by the dynamic binding process to fire the most appropriate grammar rule at every parsing step We present, then, a reformulation of that grammar as a generic rule The generic rule having the desired behaviour for rule and rule has this aspect: Equation describes a generic rule, , that returns a type for the composition of two linguistic objects The applicable partial rules will be  We will gradually adopt this algorithm to capture generic rule parsing There is not a partial rule associated to each context-free rule
