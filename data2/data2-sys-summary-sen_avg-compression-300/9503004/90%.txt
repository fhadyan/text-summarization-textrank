 The word part is ambiguous between a noun and a verb (singular, third person and the tagger seems to prefer the noun reading between a singular noun and a preposition The initial lexicon contains all the inflectional information Words not found in the lexicon are analysed by a separate finite-state transducer, the guesser the misspelt verb forms appellaient, geulait Of those unknown words, 9385 (i5 tags per word For 113 words, at least one required tag was missing (118 tags were missing as a whole, 4 words were lacking more than one tag: they are misspelt irregular verbs that have not been recognised as such  This concerned 244 words, which means that 70 % of the words did not get any irrelevant tags We also had a few examples of compound nouns improperly tagged as singular nouns, e Finally, foreign words represent another class of problematic words, especially if they are not nouns We have described the tagset, lexicon and guesser that we built for our French tagger The guesser for words that are not in the lexicon is described in more detail Some test results are given Therefore, the tagset and the lexicon together may make finer distinctions than the tagger alone Our lexicon is based on a finite-state transducer lexicon  Because noun third-person sequence is relatively common, collapsing also the third person would cause trouble in parsing Thus a feminine noun like chaise (chair) and a masculine noun like tabouret (stool) both receive the same tag NOUN-SG However, we have introduced distinctions between singular nouns (NOUN-SG plural nouns (NOUN-PL) and number-invariant nouns (NOUN-INV) such as taux (rate/rates  Ignoring gender distinction for a French tagger is certainly counter intuitive There are three major objections against this choice: Gender information would provide better disambiguation, Gender ambiguous nouns should be resolved, and Displaying gender provides more information This last category is unlikely after a masculine noun like diffuseur A tagger that would carry on the distinction would then provide sense disambiguation for such words Actually, such gender-ambiguous words are not very frequent the final number of tags after disambiguation Gender information is certainly important in itself On our test corpus of 12 000 words, only three errors violate gender agreement For instance, we introduced a word-specific tag PREP-DE for words de, des and du, and tag PREP-A for words , au and aux
