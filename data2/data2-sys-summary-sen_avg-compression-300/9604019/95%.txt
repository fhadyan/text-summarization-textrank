 Consider the following magic rule: magic_vp(VForm CSem|Args SSem t\tmagic_vp(VForm,Args,SSem  Through trimming this magic rule, e Rule 15 is more general than rule 14e rule 2 Magic evaluation constitutes an interesting combination of the advantages of top-down and bottom-up evaluation Corresponding to the first right-hand side literal in the original rule step 3 derives the following magic rule: magic_vp(P1,P,VForm CSem SSem t\tmagic_s(P0,P,VForm,SSem  The second right-hand side literal in the original rule leads to the following magic rule: magic_np(P0,P1,CSem t\tmagic_s(P0,P,VForm,SSem t\tvp(P1,P,VForm CSem SSem  As a result of the definite clause characterization of filtering, Magic brings filtering into the logic underlying the grammar As a result of characterizing filtering by a definite clause representation Magic brings filtering inside of the logic underlying the grammar This 'cyclic' magic rule is derived from the head-recursive vp rule in the example grammar
