 This paper has presented a new measure of semantic similarity in an IS-A taxonomy, based on the notion of information content In this paper, I describe an alternative way to evaluate semantic similarity in a taxonomy, based on the notion of information content Section sets up the probabilistic framework and defines the measure of semantic similarity in information-theoretic terms; Section presents an evaluation of the similarity measure against human similarity judgments, using the simple edge-counting method as a baseline; and Section discusses related work This quantitative characterization of information provides a new way to measure semantic similarity The more information two concepts share in common, the more similar they are, and the information shared by two concepts is indicated by the information content of the concepts that subsume them in the taxonomy In practice, one often needs to measure word similarity, rather than concept similarity Here, the word similarity is judged by taking the maximal information content over all concepts of which both words could be an instance Although there is no standard way to evaluate computational measures of semantic similarity, one reasonable way to judge would seem to be agreement with human similarity ratings This can be assessed by using a computational similarity measure to rate the similarity of a set of word pairs, and looking at how well its ratings correlate with human ratings of the same pairs For purposes of evaluation, three computational similarity measures were used The first is the similarity measurement using information content proposed in the previous section The similarity ratings by item are given in Table  One problem is that, like simple edge counting, the measure sometimes produces spuriously high similarity measures for words on the basis of inappropriate word senses For example, Table shows the word similarity for several words with tobacco This measure of similarity takes more information into account than the previous one: rather than relying on the single concept with maximum information content, it allows each class to contribute information content according to the value of
