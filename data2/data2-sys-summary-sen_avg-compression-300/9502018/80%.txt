 In this paper we describe a method for analysing the temporal structure of a discourse Charts such as Table 1 provide the observations we use to fill in the value of RHET/SMALL&gt RELN Those observations are summarised below e2 can precede e1 if 2 describes an event, or 1 doesn't describe an activity and 2 describes a past perfect stative Using constraints, we reduce the number of readings to 4 Using preferences, we reduce that to 2 readings for each continuation The correct temporal relations are shown in vvg John fell We presented a brief description of an algorithm for determining the temporal structure of discourse The goals of the temporal component were to yield a detailed representation of the temporal structure of the discourse, taking into account the effect of tense, aspect and temporal expressions while at the same time minimising unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure Temporal expressions such as at noon and the previous Thursday can have a similar effect: they too can override the default temporal relations and place constraints on tense The method combines a constraint-based approach with an approach based on preferences: we exploit the HPSG type hierarchy and unification to arrive at a temporal structure using constraints placed on that structure by tense, aspect, rhetorical structure and temporal expressions, and we use the temporal centering preferences described by , to rate the possibilities for temporal structure and choose the best among them But an event can only elaborate another event, as in alab: alab a \t\tbe She was building a dog house  The main advantage of this approach is that it reduces temporal structure ambiguity without having to rely on detailed world knowledge postulates We constrain S2 in this way because of lack of space; additional constraints are given in e the temporal focus of S1, here referred to as TF1 He had lost the key Hannah opened the door t\tb The problem here is determining which thread in pp they continue; ( ) continues the thread in which Sam loses the key Consider: 9 a \t\tb For the problem with multi-sentence discourses, and the threads that sentences continue, we use an implementation of temporal centering ,  This paper will focus on our temporal processing algorithm, and in particular on our analysis of narrative progression, rhetorical structure, perfects and temporal expressions Kameyama et al (1993) confirmed these preferences when testing their ideas on the Brown corpus As an example of how the temporal centering preference techniques can reduce ambiguity, recall example pp and the possible continuations shown in pp2 In example ( ) with the second thread A basic represents a sentence (or clause and complex are built up from basic and complex  In our implementation, a is simply a sign with certain information that is unnecessary for discourse processing removed RHET/SMALL&gt RELN: The relation between this DCU and a previous one Lexical items and phrases such as cue words (stored in CUE/SMALL&gt WORD) affect the value of this slot TEMPFOC: The most recent event in the current thread which a subsequent eventuality may elaborate upon (same-event overlap, come just_after or precede TENASP: Keeps track of the tense and syntactic aspect of the (if the is simple  Tense, aspect, rhetorical relations and temporal expressions affect the value of the RHET/SMALL&gt RELN type that expresses the relationship between two : cue words are lexically marked according to what rhetorical relation they specify, and this relation is passed on to the  It consists of two parts, the constraint-based portion and the preference-based portion: 1 The possible temporal/rhetorical relations are constrained (b) Lexical items such as cue words influence the value of the RHET/SMALL&gt RELN type (See Figure 1  If more than one possibility exists, semantic preferences are used to choose between the possibilities (a) A semantic distance rating between the new and each previous thread is determined
