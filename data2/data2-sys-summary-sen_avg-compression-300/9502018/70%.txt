 In this paper we describe a method for analysing the temporal structure of a discourse Charts such as Table 1 provide the observations we use to fill in the value of RHET/SMALL&gt RELN Those observations are summarised below e2 can precede e1 if 2 describes an event, or 1 doesn't describe an activity and 2 describes a past perfect stative e2 can elaborate on e1 if 1 describes an event, or 1 describes an activity and 2 describes an atelic, or 1 and 2 describe states and either 2describes a simple tense state or 1 describes a complex tense state Using constraints, we reduce the number of readings to 4 Using preferences, we reduce that to 2 readings for each continuation The correct temporal relations are shown in vvg By using constraints and preferences, we can considerably reduce the amount of ambiguity in the temporal/rhetorical structure of a discourse John fell We presented a brief description of an algorithm for determining the temporal structure of discourse The algorithm is part of an HPSG-style discourse grammar implemented in Carpenter's ALE formalism The goals of the temporal component were to yield a detailed representation of the temporal structure of the discourse, taking into account the effect of tense, aspect and temporal expressions while at the same time minimising unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure But then the resulting temporal structures will be highly ambiguous even in small discourses And sometimes this ambiguity is unwarranted It would be undesirable for the temporal processing mechanism to postulate an ambiguity in this case Of course, sometimes it is possible to take advantage of certain cue words which either indicate or constrain the rhetorical relation Temporal expressions such as at noon and the previous Thursday can have a similar effect: they too can override the default temporal relations and place constraints on tense In cons1, for example, the default interpretation would be that John's being in Detroit overlaps with his being in Boston, but the phrase the previous Thursday overrides this, giving the interpretation that John's being in Detroit precedes his being in Boston: cons1 This suggests that the temporal information given by tense acts as a weaker constraint on temporal structure than the information given by temporal adverbials The method combines a constraint-based approach with an approach based on preferences: we exploit the HPSG type hierarchy and unification to arrive at a temporal structure using constraints placed on that structure by tense, aspect, rhetorical structure and temporal expressions, and we use the temporal centering preferences described by , to rate the possibilities for temporal structure and choose the best among them The possibilities for rhetorical relations (e For example, a state can elaborate another state or an event: 5 a But an event can only elaborate another event, as in alab: alab a \t\tbe She was building a dog house  The main advantage of this approach is that it reduces temporal structure ambiguity without having to rely on detailed world knowledge postulates We constrain S2 in this way because of lack of space; additional constraints are given in e the temporal focus of S1, here referred to as TF1 He had lost the key Hannah opened the door t\tb The problem here is determining which thread in pp they continue; ( ) continues the thread in which Sam loses the key Consider: 9 a \t\tb For the problem with multi-sentence discourses, and the threads that sentences continue, we use an implementation of temporal centering ,  This paper will focus on our temporal processing algorithm, and in particular on our analysis of narrative progression, rhetorical structure, perfects and temporal expressions Kameyama et al (1993) confirmed these preferences when testing their ideas on the Brown corpus As an example of how the temporal centering preference techniques can reduce ambiguity, recall example pp and the possible continuations shown in pp2 For example, in ( ) the preference technique which allows us to choose the first thread over the second is one which assigns a higher rating to a thread whose tense is parallel to that of the new sentence; in this case both Sam rang the bell and Hannah opened the door are in the simple past tense In example ( ) with the second thread A basic represents a sentence (or clause and complex are built up from basic and complex  In our implementation, a is simply a sign with certain information that is unnecessary for discourse processing removed In our ALE implementation, a contains the following slots for temporal information: CUE/SMALL&gt WORD: Cues to rhetorical structure, e RHET/SMALL&gt RELN: The relation between this DCU and a previous one Lexical items and phrases such as cue words (stored in CUE/SMALL&gt WORD) affect the value of this slot TEMP/SMALL&gt RELNS: Stores the temporal relations between the eventualities in the discourse TEMPFOC: The most recent event in the current thread which a subsequent eventuality may elaborate upon (same-event overlap, come just_after or precede TENASP: Keeps track of the tense and syntactic aspect of the (if the is simple  Tense, aspect, rhetorical relations and temporal expressions affect the value of the RHET/SMALL&gt RELN type that expresses the relationship between two : cue words are lexically marked according to what rhetorical relation they specify, and this relation is passed on to the  Explicit relation markers such as cue words and temporal relations must be consistent and take priority over indicators such as tense and aspect It consists of two parts, the constraint-based portion and the preference-based portion: 1 The possible temporal/rhetorical relations are constrained (b) Lexical items such as cue words influence the value of the RHET/SMALL&gt RELN type (See Figure 1  If more than one possibility exists, semantic preferences are used to choose between the possibilities (a) A semantic distance rating between the new and each previous thread is determined
