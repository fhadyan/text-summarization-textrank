 Each elementary tree pair in the synchronous TAG corresponds to an elementary tree set in the MCTAG Another advantage of the new definition of synchronous derivation is in its utility for implementation of synchronous TAG transducers Under the natural definition, however, the synchronous derivation DS is just  The original definition of derivation for synchronous TAGs was based on the iterative rewriting of one derived tree pair into another The resultant derivation is isomorphic to the derivation tree for the right projection grammar, where the mapping is given directly by the synchronous grammar The right projection derivation is thus easily constructed, and the corresponding derivation tree can be computed directly Along with the advantages of the new definition of synchronous TAG derivation, new problems are introduced as well Under the natural definition, however, this would entail a derivation tree pair of the geometry given in Figure  In Vijay-Shanker's definition of derivation, a derivation tree is well-formed if no two auxiliary trees are adjoined at the same node in the same tree In our revised definition, a derivation tree is well-formed if no two predicative auxiliary trees are adjoined at the same node in the same tree Figure shows the interpretation, in terms of derived tree ( of a derivation tree ( ) with multiple adjunctions at a single node The existence of the revised definition of derivation vitiates the argument for the flat definition of synchronous TAG derivation Taking the trees and to be modifier trees, the synchronous derivation in Figure is well-formed Figure shows the derivation tree pair schematically, including the nonisomorphism mapping between the trees Choose a link between two nodes in the current derived tree pair Modify the current derived tree pair by adjoining the chosen trees at the end of the chosen link, yielding the modified derived tree pair This becomes the new current derived tree pair For example, the initial tree pair can operate at this link, yielding the tree pair given in Figure  Note that the remaining links in the tree labeled and are preserved in the derived tree pair Synchronous TAGs under this definition may specify non-tree-adjoining languages The derived tree pair for the n=2 case is given in Figure  This exclusion makes the definition of the derived tree for a given derivation tree determinate A derivation tree specifies a derived tree by virtue of the normal definitions for adjunction and substitution We would have derivation trees that specify at each node an elementary tree pair, with arcs labeled by pairs of tree addresses (such that the two addresses are linked in the parent elementary tree pair  It should be obvious that such a synchronous derivation tree can be trivially restated as a pair of standard derivation trees, further simplifying the definition of synchronous TAG derivation This leads to the following definition of synchronous TAG derivation A derivation is a pair where 1 DL is a well-formed derivation tree relative to GL DR is a well-formed derivation tree relative to GR First, the derived tree pair for a derivation is  Under the revised definition of synchronous derivation, only tree-adjoining languages can be expressed by a synchronous TAG
