 Thus, the only well-formed derivation is the one with no adjunctions whatsoever; the language of the grammar includes the single string pair generated by its initial tree pair Each elementary tree pair in the synchronous TAG corresponds to an elementary tree set in the MCTAG Each node in a left-hand tree is marked with a selective adjoining constraint that allows adjunction only of certain elementary tree sets Another advantage of the new definition of synchronous derivation is in its utility for implementation of synchronous TAG transducers Recall that under the rewriting definition, the structure of a synchronous derivation bears no uniform relationship to the kind of derivation postulated for standard TAGs and therefore recovered by standard TAG parsing algorithms Under the natural definition, however, the synchronous derivation DS is just  This close relation between a synchronous TAG derivation and derivations for the left and right projected grammars makes synchronous transduction straightforward The original definition of derivation for synchronous TAGs was based on the iterative rewriting of one derived tree pair into another The resultant derivation is isomorphic to the derivation tree for the right projection grammar, where the mapping is given directly by the synchronous grammar The right projection derivation is thus easily constructed, and the corresponding derivation tree can be computed directly Along with the advantages of the new definition of synchronous TAG derivation, new problems are introduced as well Second, the isomorphism requirement between the derivation trees may be too strong as well Under the natural definition, however, this would entail a derivation tree pair of the geometry given in Figure  It was the desire to model semantic ambiguity through violations of the prohibition that led us originally to a rewriting as opposed to a derivation tree approach to defining synchronous TAG derivation In Vijay-Shanker's definition of derivation, a derivation tree is well-formed if no two auxiliary trees are adjoined at the same node in the same tree In our revised definition, a derivation tree is well-formed if no two predicative auxiliary trees are adjoined at the same node in the same tree Figure shows the interpretation, in terms of derived tree ( of a derivation tree ( ) with multiple adjunctions at a single node The existence of the revised definition of derivation vitiates the argument for the flat definition of synchronous TAG derivation Taking the trees and to be modifier trees, the synchronous derivation in Figure is well-formed Whereas the English corresponds to a single elementary tree, the French corresponds to a tree derived by substituting the elementary tree for `on' as the NP argument of `espre  Schematically, the derivation trees should show the geometry given in Figure  Figure shows the derivation tree pair schematically, including the nonisomorphism mapping between the trees The rewriting process proceeds by choosing an initial tree pair to be the current derived tree pair and repeatedly performing the following steps: 1 Choose a link between two nodes in the current derived tree pair Modify the current derived tree pair by adjoining the chosen trees at the end of the chosen link, yielding the modified derived tree pair This becomes the new current derived tree pair Thus, the tree pair implicitly incorporates the link relation between tree addresses given by These three links are marked with the diacritics , , and respectively The link, for instance, connects the node in the left tree at address 1 with the T node in the right at address 2, thereby allowing the two trees of another tree pair to operate respectively at these two nodes For example, the initial tree pair can operate at this link, yielding the tree pair given in Figure  Note that the remaining links in the tree labeled and are preserved in the derived tree pair Synchronous TAGs under this definition may specify non-tree-adjoining languages The derived tree pair for the n=2 case is given in Figure  It is therefore not clear how synchronous TAGs can be effectively used under this definition of derivation Recall that the standard definition of TAG derivation, due to v87, is hierarchically structured in terms of derivation trees, trees that serve to characterize the operations required to construct a particular derived tree, and hence its yield TAG derivation trees are composed of nodes, conventionally notated as , possibly in its subscripted variants The parent of a node in a derivation tree will be written , and the tree that the node marks adjunction of will be notated  (Of course the root node has no parent or address; the parent and addr functions are partial A derivation tree is well-formed if for each arc in the derivation tree from to labeled with , the tree is an auxiliary tree that can be adjoined at the node in  This exclusion makes the definition of the derived tree for a given derivation tree determinate A derivation tree specifies a derived tree by virtue of the normal definitions for adjunction and substitution A definition along these lines for synchronous TAGs would be quite natural We would have derivation trees that specify at each node an elementary tree pair, with arcs labeled by pairs of tree addresses (such that the two addresses are linked in the parent elementary tree pair  A function from derivation trees to the derived tree pairs they specify a generalization of the function defined above would then be used to generate the derived trees and the language of a synchronous grammar It should be obvious that such a synchronous derivation tree can be trivially restated as a pair of standard derivation trees, further simplifying the definition of synchronous TAG derivation This leads to the following definition of synchronous TAG derivation A derivation is a pair where 1 DL is a well-formed derivation tree relative to GL DR is a well-formed derivation tree relative to GR The isomorphic operations are sanctioned by links in tree pairs This, then, is the most natural definition of synchronous tree-adjoining derivation, as it is the natural generalization of the definition of derivation for standard TAGs First, the derived tree pair for a derivation is  We show in this section that the natural definition of synchronous derivation solves the two problems described in Section  Under the revised definition of synchronous derivation, only tree-adjoining languages can be expressed by a synchronous TAG
