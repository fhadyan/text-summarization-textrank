 In this paper, we argue that Higher-Order Unification (HOU) provides a linguistically adequate tool for modeling the semantics of focus Building up on , we develop a unification-based analysis of focus which we show favourably compares with two prominent theories of focus, Rooth's Alternative Semantics and Krifka's Structured Meanings theory In this paper, we assume a definition of the FSV which is in essence Rooth's Alternative set, that is, the set of semantic objects obtained by making an appropriate substitution in the focus position Second, the prosodic data is rather unclear: the assumption that quasi-SOE contains a prosodically marked focus is a moot point (cf In this paper, we have argued that Higher-Order Unification provides an adequate tool for computing Focus Semantic Values It is also usually agreed that certain linguistic elements associate with focus in that the meaning of the utterance containing these elements varies depending on the choice of focus For instance, in the case of SOEs, we saw that the equations characterising the deaccented anaphor help determine the unidentified FSV of the utterance containing the unmarked focus Von Fintel points out that in certain cases of adverbial quantification, a focus operator associates with an unmarked focus and does not associate with a marked focus occurring in its scope - as should be clear from this article, this is unproblematic for our analysis For instance in (2a-b the focus operator only associates with focus so that the difference in focus between (2a) and (2b) induces a difference in meaning between the two utterances: in a world where Jon introduced Paul to Mary and Sarah, and no other introduction takes place, (2a) is necessarily false whilst (2b) is true focus operators, quantificational adverbs) is made contingent on the FSV which itself, varies with the choice of focus Suppose that the meaning of only is determined by the following rule: where NP VP' represent the meaning of NP and VP respectively, and FSV stands for the focus semantic value of the VP For computing the Focus Semantic Value, we propose to use Higher-Order Unification For data which is generally viewed as a test-bed for focus theory (utterances with multiple focus operators and second occurrence expressions we show that contrary to Rooth's and Krifka's theories, the HOU treatment yields a transparent analysis while avoiding under- and over-generation On the basis of this value, we can then define the FSV, written , as follows: As mentioned before, this yields a focus semantic value which is in essence Rooth's Alternative Set at the VP level in the case of a pre-verbal focus operator Focus is a much debated notion In this paper, we assume a simplified version of Jackendoff's definition: a focus is the semantic value of a prosodically prominent element For our purpose, the following characteristics are particularly important: Given Rooth's definition of the Alternative Set, a focus operator associates with any focus occurring in its scope Note that Rooth's approach critically relies on quantifier raising as a means of moving a focused NP out of the scope of a focus operator However this only applies if the focus NP is not embedded in a scope island a tuple of the form where Gd is Krifka's Focus Semantic Value and F is a (possibly complex) focus In particular, the theory requires that a focus operator combines with a syntactic constituent C whose structured semantics provides the focus (F) this operator associates with In other words, the right-adjacent sibling of a focus operator must contain all and only the foci this operator associates with Utterances with multiple focus operators are known pathological cases of focus theory: In the given context, the preferred reading of (3b) can be glossed as follows: it is also the case for SUE2, that Jon only1 read the letters she sent to PAUL1 - i Peter Under the HOU approach, (3b) is analysed as follows First, the meaning of only1 read the letters that SUE2 sent to PAUL1 is derived A possible solution for G[2] is Assuming the following semantics for we obtain the desired reading As mentioned in section , under the Alternative Semantics approach, a focus operator necessarily associates with any focus occurring in its scope Recall that in the Structured Meanings approach, the right-sibling of a focus operator must contain all and only the focus this operator associates with (cf section  the main issues of focus theory On the other hand, all three theories of focus considered here are based on the assumption that focus is prosodically marked and thus, identifiable It is commonly agreed that focus triggers the formation of an additional semantic value which we will call the Focus Semantic Value (FSV  Under the Alternative Semantics approach, SOEs are captured as follows It is assumed that the quantification domain of focus operators is a variable whose value is contextually determined the case where the focus is prosodically marked this quantification domain of focus operators is usually identified with the FSV of the VP However, in the SOE cases, the assumption is that the quantification domain of focus operators is identified with the FSV of the source clause However, under the Alternative Semantics approach, it will not be ruled out since the FSV of (6a) provides an appropriate quantification domain for the focus operator in (6b as required by the semantic of pre-verbal only, it is a set of properties whose elements can be identified with the VP semantic value
