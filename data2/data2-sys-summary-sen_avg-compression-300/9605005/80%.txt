 In this paper, we argue that Higher-Order Unification (HOU) provides a linguistically adequate tool for modeling the semantics of focus Building up on , we develop a unification-based analysis of focus which we show favourably compares with two prominent theories of focus, Rooth's Alternative Semantics and Krifka's Structured Meanings theory In this paper, we have argued that Higher-Order Unification provides an adequate tool for computing Focus Semantic Values It is also usually agreed that certain linguistic elements associate with focus in that the meaning of the utterance containing these elements varies depending on the choice of focus Von Fintel points out that in certain cases of adverbial quantification, a focus operator associates with an unmarked focus and does not associate with a marked focus occurring in its scope - as should be clear from this article, this is unproblematic for our analysis focus operators, quantificational adverbs) is made contingent on the FSV which itself, varies with the choice of focus For computing the Focus Semantic Value, we propose to use Higher-Order Unification For data which is generally viewed as a test-bed for focus theory (utterances with multiple focus operators and second occurrence expressions we show that contrary to Rooth's and Krifka's theories, the HOU treatment yields a transparent analysis while avoiding under- and over-generation On the basis of this value, we can then define the FSV, written , as follows: As mentioned before, this yields a focus semantic value which is in essence Rooth's Alternative Set at the VP level in the case of a pre-verbal focus operator Focus is a much debated notion In this paper, we assume a simplified version of Jackendoff's definition: a focus is the semantic value of a prosodically prominent element For our purpose, the following characteristics are particularly important: Given Rooth's definition of the Alternative Set, a focus operator associates with any focus occurring in its scope a tuple of the form where Gd is Krifka's Focus Semantic Value and F is a (possibly complex) focus In particular, the theory requires that a focus operator combines with a syntactic constituent C whose structured semantics provides the focus (F) this operator associates with In other words, the right-adjacent sibling of a focus operator must contain all and only the foci this operator associates with Utterances with multiple focus operators are known pathological cases of focus theory: In the given context, the preferred reading of (3b) can be glossed as follows: it is also the case for SUE2, that Jon only1 read the letters she sent to PAUL1 - i Peter A possible solution for G[2] is Assuming the following semantics for we obtain the desired reading As mentioned in section , under the Alternative Semantics approach, a focus operator necessarily associates with any focus occurring in its scope Recall that in the Structured Meanings approach, the right-sibling of a focus operator must contain all and only the focus this operator associates with (cf section  the main issues of focus theory On the other hand, all three theories of focus considered here are based on the assumption that focus is prosodically marked and thus, identifiable It is commonly agreed that focus triggers the formation of an additional semantic value which we will call the Focus Semantic Value (FSV  It is assumed that the quantification domain of focus operators is a variable whose value is contextually determined the case where the focus is prosodically marked this quantification domain of focus operators is usually identified with the FSV of the VP However, in the SOE cases, the assumption is that the quantification domain of focus operators is identified with the FSV of the source clause
