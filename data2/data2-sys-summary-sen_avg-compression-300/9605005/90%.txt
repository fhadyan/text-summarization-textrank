 Building up on , we develop a unification-based analysis of focus which we show favourably compares with two prominent theories of focus, Rooth's Alternative Semantics and Krifka's Structured Meanings theory In this paper, we have argued that Higher-Order Unification provides an adequate tool for computing Focus Semantic Values It is also usually agreed that certain linguistic elements associate with focus in that the meaning of the utterance containing these elements varies depending on the choice of focus Clearly, our approach extends to cases of adverbial quantification focus operators, quantificational adverbs) is made contingent on the FSV which itself, varies with the choice of focus For computing the Focus Semantic Value, we propose to use Higher-Order Unification at the VP level in the case of a pre-verbal focus operator Focus is a much debated notion For our purpose, the following characteristics are particularly important: Given Rooth's definition of the Alternative Set, a focus operator associates with any focus occurring in its scope a tuple of the form where Gd is Krifka's Focus Semantic Value and F is a (possibly complex) focus In particular, the theory requires that a focus operator combines with a syntactic constituent C whose structured semantics provides the focus (F) this operator associates with Recall that in the Structured Meanings approach, the right-sibling of a focus operator must contain all and only the focus this operator associates with (cf the main issues of focus theory On the other hand, all three theories of focus considered here are based on the assumption that focus is prosodically marked and thus, identifiable It is commonly agreed that focus triggers the formation of an additional semantic value which we will call the Focus Semantic Value (FSV  the case where the focus is prosodically marked this quantification domain of focus operators is usually identified with the FSV of the VP
