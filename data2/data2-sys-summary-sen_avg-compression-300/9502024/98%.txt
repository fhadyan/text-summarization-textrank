 Table shows the results of the robust parser on WSJ Our robust parser can recover these extragrammatical sentences with 68 77% accuracy To enhance the performance of the robust parser for extragrammatical sentences, we proposed several heuristics When handling sentences, the robust parser assings more error values( ) to the error hypothesis edge occurring within a fiducial nonterminal
