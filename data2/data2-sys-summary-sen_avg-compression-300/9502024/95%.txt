 Otherwise, the normal parser fails, and then the robust parser starts to execute with edges generated by the normal parser Of these sentences, 410 are failed in normal parsing, and are processed again by the robust parser Among 1,000 sentences from the ATIS, 465 sentences are processed by the robust parser after the failure of the normal parsing Our robust parser can recover these extragrammatical sentences with 68 77% accuracy To enhance the performance of the robust parser for extragrammatical sentences, we proposed several heuristics Heuristics 1: error types The analysis on 3,538 sentences of the Penn treebank corpus WSJ shows that there are 498 sentences with phrase deletions and 224 sentences with phrase insertions When handling sentences, the robust parser assings more error values( ) to the error hypothesis edge occurring within a fiducial nonterminal One module is a normal parser which is the bottom-up chart parser
