 Our treatment of coordination incorporates an adaptation of recent work on ellipsis which resorts to the idea of parallel structures ( , , , but unlike these approaches which stress semantic parallelism, we use both syntactic and semantic parallelism Early work on coordination proposed meta-grammatical treatments (e Thus in that example, John would parse as the subject noun phrase of a sentence with a complex verb phrase Notice that what we mean by V and W having parallel parses is not that they must necessarily follow the same structure to the last details, but that their structures must complement each other so that missing constituents in one may be reconstructed from the other Another thing to notice is that, whereas in the first analysis of Wood's example we end up with two conjoined sentences, in the analysis just proposed we end up with a sentence having a verb phrase which decomposes into two conjoined verb phrases Linguistically speaking, it is arguable whether one analysis is preferable over the other one But computationally speaking, the second analysis allows us to apply our meta-grammatical treatment of coordination to sentences for which the first analysis would fail tries Z=2, and uses top-down prediction to find a (possibly incomplete) noun phrase stretching from point 6 to some point P, e through the rule: succeeds with substitutions X=7, Y=7,P=8 Notice that, at the point in which the constraint succeeds with substitutions X=7, Y=7, if the grammar included arguments for semantic representation, the semantic representations for the two nouns would be unified, given that one of them is missing (as shown by the fact that its starting point, 7, is the same as its ending point  We shall later give a full example involving semantic representations and their parts, such that each pair contains two semantically and structurally similar objects describes an elliptical construction as one involving two phases (usually clauses) that are parallel in structure in some sense Intuitively, default unification takes two feature structures, one of which (called the TARGET) is identified as strict , while the other one (called the SOURCE) is defeasible , and combines the information in both such that the information in the strict structure takes priority over that in the defeasible structure postulated a similar analysis, but it was based on -calculus semantic representations, and used higher order unification Their analysis of such structures consists of: a) determining the parallel structure of source and target; b) determining which are parallel elements in source and target (eg Dan and George are parallel elements in the example c) using Huet's higher-order unification algorithm for finding a property P such that P(s1 sn S, where s1 through sn are the interpretations of the parallel elements of the source, and s is the interpretation of the source itself Only solutions which do not contain a primary occurrence of the parallel elements are considered (occurrences are primary if they arise directly from the parallel elements, as opposed to those arising for instance from a pronoun  likes(dan,golf) contains a primary occurrence of the parallel element, dan , and must therefore be discardede the parallel elements with the exception of the last two arguments, which are generating from the two pairs of last arguments P1-P2 and P2+1-P3 of the parallel structures, as P1 and P3  We obtain: After this theorem's addition, the sent rule can apply to derive The previous section shows that when we introduce syntactic as well as semantic parallelism, this can help determine which are the parallel structures automatically, by incremental application of a Datalog grammar constraint on coordination coupled with top-down prediction to complete any missing structures through an analysis of parallelism that is inspired in that of but complements it in various ways In the first place, we must note that a simple conjoining of the representations obtained for the parallel structures as proposed in may not, as the example of the previous section shows, suffice Since these structures are quite dissimilar, we must conjoin only the parallel elements We postulate that the parallel elements will be represented by those subterms which are not unifiable Thus our analysis can handle more cases than those in previous related work
