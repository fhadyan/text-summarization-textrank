 Our treatment of coordination incorporates an adaptation of recent work on ellipsis which resorts to the idea of parallel structures ( , , , but unlike these approaches which stress semantic parallelism, we use both syntactic and semantic parallelism Early work on coordination proposed meta-grammatical treatments (e requantification Thus in that example, John would parse as the subject noun phrase of a sentence with a complex verb phrase Linguistically speaking, it is arguable whether one analysis is preferable over the other one We shall later give a full example involving semantic representations and their parts, such that each pair contains two semantically and structurally similar objects describes an elliptical construction as one involving two phases (usually clauses) that are parallel in structure in some sense postulated a similar analysis, but it was based on -calculus semantic representations, and used higher order unification Their analysis of such structures consists of: a) determining the parallel structure of source and target; b) determining which are parallel elements in source and target (e likes(dan,golf) contains a primary occurrence of the parallel element, dan , and must therefore be discardede the parallel elements with the exception of the last two arguments, which are generating from the two pairs of last arguments P1-P2 and P2+1-P3 of the parallel structures, as P1 and P3  We obtain: After this theorem's addition, the sent rule can apply to derive The previous section shows that when we introduce syntactic as well as semantic parallelism, this can help determine which are the parallel structures automatically, by incremental application of a Datalog grammar constraint on coordination coupled with top-down prediction to complete any missing structures through an analysis of parallelism that is inspired in that of but complements it in various ways In the first place, we must note that a simple conjoining of the representations obtained for the parallel structures as proposed in may not, as the example of the previous section shows, suffice Since these structures are quite dissimilar, we must conjoin only the parallel elements Thus our analysis can handle more cases than those in previous related work
