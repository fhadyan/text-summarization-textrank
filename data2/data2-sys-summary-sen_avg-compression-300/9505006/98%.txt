 requantification We shall later give a full example involving semantic representations postulated a similar analysis, but it was based on -calculus semantic representations, and used higher order unification Their analysis of such structures consists of: a) determining the parallel structure of source and target; b) determining which are parallel elements in source and target (e Since these structures are quite dissimilar, we must conjoin only the parallel elements
