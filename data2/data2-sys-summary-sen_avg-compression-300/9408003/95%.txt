 Therefore, any use of a feature structure to describe an object demands that the feature structure can be interpreted as true or false of the object However, I insert morphs between feature structures and objects to yield an interpretation free characterisation of a satisfiable feature structure ] I write for  ] ] ] ] A feature structure approximates a morph iff the Moshier abstraction of the feature structure abstractly subsumes (see [ the morph I then use this interpretation to define the notion of a satisfiable feature structure ] ] ] ] Each resolved feature structure is a well-typed (see [ feature structure with output alphabet  In fact, Troll represents each feature structure as a disjunction of the resolvants of the feature structure Loosely speaking, the resolvants of a feature structure have the same underlying finite state automaton as the feature structure, and differ only in their output function
