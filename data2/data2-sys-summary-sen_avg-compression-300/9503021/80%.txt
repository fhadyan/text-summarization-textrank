 The objects of feature theories are abstract linguistic objects, e Is it perhaps the case that any language that has a nondeterministic polynomial time recognition algorithm can be generated by an R-AVG Does there exist a tight relation between time bounded machines and R-AVGs as e In such a way, for polynomial time computable functions one can guarantee that the inverse of the function is computable in nondeterministic polynomial time As a more liberal constraint on R-AVGs we propose an analogous variation on the OLP Definition thedefctr: A grammar G satisfies the Honest Parsability Constraint(HPC) iff there exists a polynomial p s From Smolka's algorithm and Trautwein's observation it trivially follows that any attribute-value grammar that satisfies the HPC (HP-AVG) has an recognition algorithm Nonetheless, we can produce a set of rules that, when added to an attribute-value grammar enforces the HPC The newly produced language is then a subset of the old produced language with an recognition algorithm1 The class, P-AVGL, of languages produced by the HP-AVGs is recursively presentable For any language L that has an recognition algorithm, there exists a restricted attribute-value grammar G that respects the HPC and such that L=L(G  Add the set of rules that guarantee that only strings that can be produced with a polynomial number of rules can be produced by the grammar In fact, for well-behaved functions, the construction of a counter gives a method to enforce any desired time bound constraint on the recognition problem for attribute-value grammars1 The class of languages generated by R-AVGs obeying the LDP condition is exactly  Obviously, to be of any practical use, the rewrite grammar or the attribute-value language must be more restrictive In Section we show that the class of languages generated by an R-AVG (R-AVGL) includes the class of context free languages (CFL  Definition thedefctr: An attribute-value language consists of sets of logical formulas that describe feature graphs, by expressing constraints on the type of paths that can exist within the graphs The formulas of an attribute-value language are path equations and Boolean combinations of path equations Definition thedefctr: Let T be a constituent structure tree and F be a set of formulas in an attribute-value language  Definition thedefctr: 1 We say that a class of grammars is recursively presentable iff the class of sets is recursively presentable The only formulas that are allowed in the attribute-value language of restricted attribute-value grammars (R-AVGs) are path-equations and conjunctions of path-equations (i The CST of an R-AVG is produced by a chain- and -rule free regular grammar Definition thedefctr: The set of syntactic rules of a restricted attribute-value grammar is a subset of &gt  A restricted attribute-value grammar is a pair &gt where rules is a set of syntactic rules and start is an element of  The values are either atomic or attribute-value matrices Definition thedefctr: An R-AVG &gt; generates an annotated constituent structure tree iff 1e describes a feature graphg context free languages (CFLs which have a polynomial time parsing algorithm  Let L be a context free language According to Theorem , it is unlikely that the languages generated by R-AVGs can be limited to those languages with a polynomial time recognition algorithm Trautwein showed that all R-AVGs have nondeterministic polynomial time algorithms
