 Is it perhaps the case that any language that has a nondeterministic polynomial time recognition algorithm can be generated by an R-AVG The newly produced language is then a subset of the old produced language with an recognition algorithm The formulas of an attribute-value language are path equations and Boolean combinations of path equations The only formulas that are allowed in the attribute-value language of restricted attribute-value grammars (R-AVGs) are path-equations and conjunctions of path-equations (i The CST of an R-AVG is produced by a chain- and -rule free regular grammar Definition thedefctr: The set of syntactic rules of a restricted attribute-value grammar is a subset of &gt  The values are either atomic or attribute-value matricesg context free languages (CFLs which have a polynomial time parsing algorithm  Trautwein showed that all R-AVGs have nondeterministic polynomial time algorithms
