 In a lazy learning approach, on the other hand, knowledge acquisition is automatic Lazy Learning is fundamentally a classification paradigm Identification These processes implement lexical performance Current lexical research in language technology is eminently knowledge-based in this respect The learning component implements a learning method Different tasks require different lexical information Also, different theoretical formalisms, domains, and languages require different types of lexical information and therefore possibly also different types of lexical knowledge representation and different acquisition methods In lazy learning, performance crucially depends on the distance metric used
