 In a lazy learning approach, on the other hand, knowledge acquisition is automatic Lazy Learning is fundamentally a classification paradigm Identification Segmentation In the lazy learning approach ( ; we used the windowing approach referred to earlier to formulate the task as a classification problem (more specifically, a segmentation problem  The lazy learning approach produced results which were more accurate than both a connectionist approach (backpropagation learning in a recurrent multi-layer perceptron) and a knowledge-based approach Section 3 introduces lazy learning, the symbolic machine learning paradigm which we have used in experiments in lexical acquisition These processes implement lexical performance As far as lexical knowledge is concerned, this knowledge is represented in a lexical knowledge base, introduced either by hand or semi-automatically using machine-readable dictionaries Consistency Heuristic The learning component implements a learning method Recently, there has been an increased interest in Machine Learning for lazy learning methods Different tasks require different lexical information Also, different theoretical formalisms, domains, and languages require different types of lexical information and therefore possibly also different types of lexical knowledge representation and different acquisition methods In lazy learning, performance crucially depends on the distance metric used Linguistic tasks (including lexical tasks) are context-sensitive mappings from one representation to another (e To illustrate the difference between the traditional knowledge-based approach with the lazy learning approach, consider Fig
