 In a lazy learning approach, on the other hand, knowledge acquisition is automatic In constructive induction, completely new feature dimensions may be introduced for separating the different category areas better in feature space Lazy Learning is fundamentally a classification paradigm Identification Segmentation In the lazy learning approach ( ; we used the windowing approach referred to earlier to formulate the task as a classification problem (more specifically, a segmentation problem  The lazy learning approach produced results which were more accurate than both a connectionist approach (backpropagation learning in a recurrent multi-layer perceptron) and a knowledge-based approach Again, in the knowledge-based approach, the lexical requirements for such a system are extensive In a lazy learning approach ( ; again a windowing approach was used to formulate the task as a classification problem (identification this time: given a set of possible phonemes, determine which phoneme should be used to translate a target spelling symbol taking into account its context  Results were highly similar to the syllable boundary prediction task: the lazy learning approach resulted in systems which were more accurate than both a connectionist approach and a linguistically motivated approach Section 3 introduces lazy learning, the symbolic machine learning paradigm which we have used in experiments in lexical acquisition Instead of concentrating on linguistic engineering of theory-neutral, poly-theoretic, multi-applicable lexical representations combined with semi-automatic migration of lexical knowledge between different formats, we propose an approach in which a single inductive learning method is reused on different corpora representing useful linguistic mappings, acquiring the necessary lexical information automatically and implicitly These processes implement lexical performance As far as lexical knowledge is concerned, this knowledge is represented in a lexical knowledge base, introduced either by hand or semi-automatically using machine-readable dictionaries It is useful in Machine Learning to make a distinction between a learning component and a performance component The learning component implements a learning method Other evaluation criteria include learning and performance speed, memory requirements, clarity of learned representations, etc Recently, there has been an increased interest in Machine Learning for lazy learning methods Different tasks require different lexical information Also, different theoretical formalisms, domains, and languages require different types of lexical information and therefore possibly also different types of lexical knowledge representation and different acquisition methods In lazy learning, performance crucially depends on the distance metric used Elsewhere ( ; ) we introduced the concept of information gain (also used in decision tree learning, ) into lazy learning to weigh the importance of different features in a domain-independent way Linguistic tasks (including lexical tasks) are context-sensitive mappings from one representation to another (e To illustrate the difference between the traditional knowledge-based approach with the lazy learning approach, consider Fig
