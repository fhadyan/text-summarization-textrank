 The PVI system is a fully-implemented system, although as yet limited to a small semantic domain That is why our system is based on the following processes: analysis of the semantic content of the icons used, and attribution of a semantic role to each of them; lexical choice: determining the best words to use to convey the semantic content; linguistic generation: generation of a natural language utterance from a topicalized representation adapted to linguistic semantics Each icon has its semantic content determined (a) by the taxeme it belongs to, and (b) by elementary meaning features, the specific features, which allow icons of the same taxeme to be distinguished The symbols treated by PVI are represented in a structural semantic system, where the meaning content of every icon lies in fact in the features which distinguish it from the other icons The elementary features used to describe this meaning are valuated attributes (most of the time binary which constitute the semantic primitives of the system The semantic analysis process tries to reconstruct the meaning of the sequence of icons pointed at by the user It builds a meaning representation of the user's utterance, in which every icon in the sequence is attributed a semantic role The information that we have a priori on the meaning of icons is (a) inner features generic or specific (b) a casual structure, if the icon has some predicative content, where case features specify the semantic features which the functors are expected to possess (see figure based on observations from the corpus This is done by assembling the small pieces of semantic network that for every predicative icon, this casual structure constitutes It is a binary relation defined on two sets of semantic features The result of an analysis is a semantic network expressed in a linear form This process (figure ) will build a linguistic semantic network fit to be generated into natural language words and sentences The last phase is the generation of a natural language sentence conveying the meaning of the linguistic semantic network The semantic structure of casual relations linking a sememe to its casual fillers is itself expressed in natural language through a morpho-syntactic structure which native speakers of a language will identify
