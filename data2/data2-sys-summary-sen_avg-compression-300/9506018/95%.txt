 The PVI system is a fully-implemented system, although as yet limited to a small semantic domain Each icon has its semantic content determined (a) by the taxeme it belongs to, and (b) by elementary meaning features, the specific features, which allow icons of the same taxeme to be distinguished The symbols treated by PVI are represented in a structural semantic system, where the meaning content of every icon lies in fact in the features which distinguish it from the other icons The semantic analysis process tries to reconstruct the meaning of the sequence of icons pointed at by the user This is done by assembling the small pieces of semantic network that for every predicative icon, this casual structure constitutes It is a binary relation defined on two sets of semantic features The result of an analysis is a semantic network expressed in a linear form This process (figure ) will build a linguistic semantic network fit to be generated into natural language words and sentences The last phase is the generation of a natural language sentence conveying the meaning of the linguistic semantic network
