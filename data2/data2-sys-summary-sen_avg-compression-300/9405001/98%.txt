 The similarity model was correct in 64 cases, and the back-off model in 3201 level A more substantial variation would be to base the model on similarity between conditioned words rather than on similarity between conditioning words Thus our application of the similarity model averages together standard back-off estimates for a set of similar conditioning words The bigram similarity model was also tested as a language model in speech recognition
