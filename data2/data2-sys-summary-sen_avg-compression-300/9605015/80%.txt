 Examining the grammar, we find that there are three large interesting groups of rules and features, describing three separate complexes of linguistic phenomena: question-formation, clitic pronouns and agreement The phrase-structure rules analyse an inverted WH-question as constituting a fronted WH+ element followed by an inverted clause containing a gap element The feature inv distinguishes inverted from uninverted clauses Firstly, English only permits subject-verb inversion when the verb is an auxiliary, or a form of have or be in contrast, French potentially allows subject-verb inversion with any verb For this reason, English question-formation using auxiliary do lacks a corresponding construction in French Secondly, French permits two other common question-formation constructions in addition to subject-verb inversion: prefacing the declarative version of the clause with the question particle est-ce que and complex inversion i fronting the subject and inserting a dummy pronoun after the inverted verb Section describes the French morphology rules Section  Figure presents examples illustrating the main French question constructions Modification of the English syntax rules to capture the basic requirements so far is quite simple In our grammar, we added three extra rules to cover the est-ce que complex-inversion and pseudo-inversion constructions: the second of these rules combines the complex-inverted verb with the following dummy pronoun to form a verb, in essence treating the dummy pronoun as a kind of verbal affix A further rule deals with the hyphen linking an inverted verb with a following subject In French, the corresponding feature has five values: inverted, uninverted, est_ce_que, complex and pseudo, distinguishing clauses formed using the different question-formation constructions Sections and describe the French and Spanish grammars In particular, the English semantic rules can still be used, and produce QLF representations with similar form For example: ?Quand est-ce que le prochain vol est? ?Combien de vols est-ce qu'il y a? We enforce this by adding a suitable feature to the verb category Section concludes More specifically, we introduce two sets of new rules The first set handles the surface clitics A second set of gap rules defines empty constituents of category NP or PP, occurring at the notional deep positions occupied by the clitics The clitics feature is used to link the cliticised V constituent and its associated clitic gap or gaps The clitics feature-bundle is threaded through the grammar rule which defines the structure of the list of clitics associated with a cliticised verb, and enforces the constraints on ordering of surface clitics We summarize the main points: Position of surface clitics: Clitics occur post-verbally in positive imperative clauses, otherwise pre-verbally Although grammatical agreement is a linguistic phenomenon that plays a considerably larger role in French than in English, the adjustments needed to the lexicon and syntax rules are usually obvious In general, the Spanish rules were distinctly simpler than the French ones With a few exceptions noted below (in particular, prodrop the current Spanish syntax rules are essentially a slightly modified subset of the French ones In a little more detail: Question-formation: The Spanish rules for question-formation are similar to, but less elaborate than the French ones There are no constructions corresponding to est-ce que or complex inversion Clitics: The Spanish clitic system is also considerably simpler than the French one Since CLE morphotax rules have a uniform format , 3 The English to French version of SLT is of a standard comparable to the original English to Swedish version9 this only involved moving the relevant syntax rules to the morphology rule file Phrasal rules: The rules for Spanish numbers, dates and times are substantially different from the French ones, and those for dates in particular needed to be rewritten more or less from scratch Handling this alternation correctly involves trailing an extra feature through many grammar rules, so as to link the main verb in the relative clause to the main verb in the clause immediately above it Prodrop: The second substantial change required when adapting the French grammar to Spanish was necessitated by the prodrop rule: Spanish, unlike French, permits and indeed encourages omission of the subject when it is a pronoun A new syntax rule of the form S VP was added (it is in fact a slightly modified version of the French imperative-formation rule  The preceding sections describe in essence all the changes we needed to make in order to adapt a substantial English language processing system to French and Spanish Thus for any given surface string, the rules define a set of possible QLF representations of that string Conversely, given a well-formed QLF representation, the rules can be used to produce a set of possible surface-form realisations of the QLF Morphology: This set of rules defines the inflectional morphology of the language, allowing analysis of words in terms of stems and inflections The morphology rules are described further in Section  Syntax: Syntax rules are written in a unification-based feature-grammar formalism When adapting the system to French and Spanish, the problems arose almost exclusively in connection with morphology and syntax rules Compilation of the full sets of two-level rules describing spelling changes and of production rules describing legal affix combinations takes of the order of a minute, allowing changes to the rules to be debugged relatively easily Two-level spelling rules were also used to describe the inter-word effects that are particularly common in French The total number of rules required to describe inflectional morphology was around 75 for French and 50 for Spanish (inter-word rules being responsible for much of the difference  Intra-word spelling changes for French present several problems not encountered in English inflectional morphology In particular, French exhibits many multiple letter changes, e The French and Spanish versions of the CLE are both reversible and can be used for either analysis or generation Less trivial problems, however, arise from the fact that spelling changes in French generally cannot be predicted from the surface form of the word alone In French, such changes are far more widespread and can be complex When comparing the French and English grammars, there are two types of objects of immediate interest: syntax rules and features Looking first at the rules themselves, about 80% of the French syntax rules are either identical with or very similar to the English counterparts from which they have been adapted Of the remainder, some rules (e
