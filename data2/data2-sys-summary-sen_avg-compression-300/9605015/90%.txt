 The feature inv distinguishes inverted from uninverted clauses For this reason, English question-formation using auxiliary do lacks a corresponding construction in French fronting the subject and inserting a dummy pronoun after the inverted verb Section describes the French morphology rules Figure presents examples illustrating the main French question constructions In our grammar, we added three extra rules to cover the est-ce que complex-inversion and pseudo-inversion constructions: the second of these rules combines the complex-inverted verb with the following dummy pronoun to form a verb, in essence treating the dummy pronoun as a kind of verbal affix A further rule deals with the hyphen linking an inverted verb with a following subject In French, the corresponding feature has five values: inverted, uninverted, est_ce_que, complex and pseudo, distinguishing clauses formed using the different question-formation constructions Sections and describe the French and Spanish grammars In particular, the English semantic rules can still be used, and produce QLF representations with similar form More specifically, we introduce two sets of new rules The first set handles the surface clitics The clitics feature is used to link the cliticised V constituent and its associated clitic gap or gaps In general, the Spanish rules were distinctly simpler than the French ones In a little more detail: Question-formation: The Spanish rules for question-formation are similar to, but less elaborate than the French ones Clitics: The Spanish clitic system is also considerably simpler than the French one9 this only involved moving the relevant syntax rules to the morphology rule file Phrasal rules: The rules for Spanish numbers, dates and times are substantially different from the French ones, and those for dates in particular needed to be rewritten more or less from scratch Handling this alternation correctly involves trailing an extra feature through many grammar rules, so as to link the main verb in the relative clause to the main verb in the clause immediately above it Prodrop: The second substantial change required when adapting the French grammar to Spanish was necessitated by the prodrop rule: Spanish, unlike French, permits and indeed encourages omission of the subject when it is a pronoun The morphology rules are described further in Section  Syntax: Syntax rules are written in a unification-based feature-grammar formalism When adapting the system to French and Spanish, the problems arose almost exclusively in connection with morphology and syntax rules Compilation of the full sets of two-level rules describing spelling changes and of production rules describing legal affix combinations takes of the order of a minute, allowing changes to the rules to be debugged relatively easily Two-level spelling rules were also used to describe the inter-word effects that are particularly common in French The total number of rules required to describe inflectional morphology was around 75 for French and 50 for Spanish (inter-word rules being responsible for much of the difference  Intra-word spelling changes for French present several problems not encountered in English inflectional morphology In particular, French exhibits many multiple letter changes, e When comparing the French and English grammars, there are two types of objects of immediate interest: syntax rules and features Of the remainder, some rules (e
