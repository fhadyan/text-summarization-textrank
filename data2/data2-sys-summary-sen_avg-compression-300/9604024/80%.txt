 Assumption 1 All lexical signs must be indexed, including functional and nonpredicative elements  Assumption 2 All lexical signs must be connected to each other Two lexical signs are connected if they are directly connected; furthermore, the connectivity relation is transitive To ensure that only connected lexical signs are generated and analysed, the following assumption must also be made: Assumption 3 A grammar will only generate or analyse connected lexical signs To show this, consider the test-rewrite sequence for Example : Test: dog barked the brown big Rewrite: barked the dog brown big Test: barked (the dog) brown big Rewrite: (the dog) barked brown big Test: the dog) barked) brown big Rewrite: the brown dog barked big Test: the (brown dog barked) big Rewrite: the big (brown dog) barked Test: the (big (brown dog barked) (terminate) In this sequence double underscore indicates the starting position of a moved constituent; the moved constituent itself is given in bold face; the bracketing indicates analysed constituents (for expository purposes the algorithm has been oversimplified, but the general idea remains the same  This action causes the complete structure for `the dog barked' to be discarded and replaced with that for `the brown dog barked which in turn is discarded and replaced by `the big brown dog barked  These relationships form a graph indicating the necessary conditions for a lexical item to form part of a complete sentence Take the following bag: Ex 2 {dog1,the1,brown1,big1} (corresponding to `the big brown dog  Note that deciding whether a lexical sign can appear outside a phrase is determined purely by the grammar, and not by whether the lexical elements share the same index or not Outer domains are defined as follow: Definition 3 { (Sign,Lex,Binds) Sign , Lex and there exists a derivation Sign' Lex' or Lex' Sign' , and Sign' a unifier for Sign, Lex' a unifier for Lex, and Binds the set of all path pairs [SignPath,LexPath] such that Sign SignPath is token identical with Lex LexPath} Intuitively, the outer domains indicate that preterminal category Lex can appear in a complete sentence with subconstituent Sign, such that Lex is not a leaf of Sign Outer domains thus represent elements which may lie outside a subtree of category Sign in a complete sentential derivation The following definition specifies how outer domains are used: Definition 4 A lexical sign Lex' is in the outer domain of Sign' iff there is a triple (Sign,Lex,Binds) in outer domains such that Sign and Lex unify with Sign' and Lex' respectively, and there is at least one pair [PathS,PathL] Binds such that Sign PathS unifies with Lex PathL In compiling outer domains, inner domains are used to facilitate computation Inner domains are defined as follows: Definition 5 { (Sign,Lex,Binds) Sign , Lex and there exists a derivation Lex' , with Sign' a unifier for Sign, Lex' a unifier for Lex, and Binds the set of all path pairs [SignPath,LexPath]such that Sign SignPath is token identical with Lex LexPath} The inner domains thus express all the possible terminal categories which may be derived from each nonterminal in the grammar Such a wfss will have been constructed during the bag generation process By Assumption , the lexical elements in the bag, and therefore in any grammatical ordering of it, are connected Consider Example  To eliminate the wfss `the dog' from further consideration, a connected graph of lexical signs is constructed before generation is started (Figure
