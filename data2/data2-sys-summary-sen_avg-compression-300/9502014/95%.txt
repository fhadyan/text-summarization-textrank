 Ellipsis interpretations are represented as simple sets of substitutions on semantic representations of the antecedent For the QLF to be interpretable, it is necessary to give the antecedent book term wide scope over the ellipsis in order to discharge the index The first reading involves scoping the book quantifier before ellipsis resolution The modification is to allow (strict) substitutions on terms not explicitly appearing in the ellipsis antecedent i the implicit his paper in the second ellipsis when resolving the third ellipsis Multiple VP Ellipsis Multiple VP ellipsis poses problems at the level of determining which VP is the antecedent of which ellipsis Other Forms of Ellipsis: Other forms of ellipsis, besides VP-ellipsis can be handled substitutionally Any uninstantiated meta-variables in the antecedent are thus re-entrant in the ellipsis Whichever scoping is given to the antecedent, a parallel scoping should be given to the ellipsis This increases the computational complexity of the ellipsis resolution task gives `every house' wide scope over both antecedent and ellipsis In this case the two terms, in ellipsis and antecedent are both discharged (i We replace both the term and its index by the corresponding term and index from the ellipsis In this way, the version of the term occurring in the ellipsis is directly linked to antecedent term
