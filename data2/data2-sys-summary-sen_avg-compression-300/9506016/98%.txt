 An example of defeasible preferences is the interpretation of the pronoun he in discourse John hit Bill The present set of examples highlights four major sources of preference in pronoun interpretation SUBJECT Antecedent Preference, Pronominal Chain Preference, Grammatical Parallelism Preference, and Commonsense Preference SUBJECT Antecedent Preference Pronominal Chain Preference Grammatical Parallelism Preference In example L, the parallelism preference overrides the pronominal chain preference Utterance interpretation depends on the context, and utterance meaning updates the context Both linguistic semantics and commonsense preferences apply on the same discourse model Commonsense Knowledge The SUBJECT Antecedent Preference and Pronominal Chain Preference result from CENTER, GF ORDER, EXP ORDER, and EXP CENTER These are examples of the defeasible Commonsense Rules (WK) stating the preferred discourse model Utterance interpretation induces a complex interaction of defeasible rules in the pragmatics subsystem There are grammatical preferences inducing fast entity-level inferences only indirectly suggesting the preferred discourse model, and commonsense preferences inducing slow proposition-level inferences directly determining the preferred discourse model
