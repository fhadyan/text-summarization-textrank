 The present focus is the interpretation preferences of intersentential pronominal anaphora Although this aspect of interpretation cannot be neglected in a discourse processing model, its relevance to a logical model of discourse semantics and pragmatics has remained unclear An example of defeasible preferences is the interpretation of the pronoun he in discourse John hit Bill In 1993, I conducted a survey of pronoun interpretation preferences using the discourse examples shown in Table 1 The present set of examples highlights four major sources of preference in pronoun interpretation SUBJECT Antecedent Preference, Pronominal Chain Preference, Grammatical Parallelism Preference, and Commonsense Preference SUBJECT Antecedent Preference Pronominal Chain Preference This processing tendency indicates that the grammatical preference is processed faster than the commonsense preference Grammatical Parallelism Preference In example L, the parallelism preference overrides the pronominal chain preference Utterance interpretation depends on the context, and utterance meaning updates the context Four major sources of preference have been identified in the above pronoun interpretation examples The pragmatics subsystem contains sets of preference rules that, in certain combinations, could lead to conflicting preferences Existing logical semantic theories employing dynamic interpretation rules (e It also contains the evolving discourse structure, temporal structure, and event structure Both linguistic semantics and commonsense preferences apply on the same discourse model Commonsense Knowledge Lascarides and Asher (1993) extend the Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp, 1981) with the interaction of defeasible rules for integrating a new utterance content into the discourse information state The SUBJECT Antecedent Preference and Pronominal Chain Preference result from CENTER, GF ORDER, EXP ORDER, and EXP CENTER The Grammatical Parallelism Preference is PARA These are examples of the defeasible Commonsense Rules (WK) stating the preferred discourse model Take two examples: (1) John met Bill It may be the general pattern of changing preferences during utterance interpretation The preference interaction patterns discussed here can perhaps be formulated as fine-grained upgrading inferences during utterance interpretation within the proposed utterance interpretation architecture Utterance interpretation induces a complex interaction of defeasible rules in the pragmatics subsystem There are grammatical preferences inducing fast entity-level inferences only indirectly suggesting the preferred discourse model, and commonsense preferences inducing slow proposition-level inferences directly determining the preferred discourse model The attentional state in the context supports the formulation of attentional rules that significantly affect pronoun interpretation preferences Vague predicates and functions represent various expression and construction types whose interpretation depends on the discourse context Preferences are affected by computationally expensive open-ended commonsense inferences
