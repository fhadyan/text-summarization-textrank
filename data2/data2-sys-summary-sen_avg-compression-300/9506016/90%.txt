 In sum, with the ILF sealing off the space of grammatical reasoning, the present discourse processing architecture magnifies the importance of pragmatics in utterance interpretation The present focus is the interpretation preferences of intersentential pronominal anaphora These computational approaches to discourse have recognized the non-truth-conditional effects on utterance interpretation coming from the utterance's surface structure (i Although this aspect of interpretation cannot be neglected in a discourse processing model, its relevance to a logical model of discourse semantics and pragmatics has remained unclear An example of defeasible preferences is the interpretation of the pronoun he in discourse John hit Bill In 1993, I conducted a survey of pronoun interpretation preferences using the discourse examples shown in Table 1 The present set of examples highlights four major sources of preference in pronoun interpretation SUBJECT Antecedent Preference, Pronominal Chain Preference, Grammatical Parallelism Preference, and Commonsense Preference SUBJECT Antecedent Preference Pronominal Chain Preference This processing tendency indicates that the grammatical preference is processed faster than the commonsense preference Grammatical Parallelism Preference This preference is demonstrated in example D that involves two pronouns In example L, the parallelism preference overrides the pronominal chain preference An x hit y back event conventionally presupposes that a y hit x event has previously occurred, leading to the near-unanimous interpretation Bill hit John back Commonsense Preference Conventional Presuppositions (triggered by adverbs in examples C and E) and Commonsense Preferences (examples F, G, and H) dictate the final preference Grammatical Preferences take charge in the absence of relevant Commonsense Preferences (examples A-E, K, and L  The SUBJECT Antecedent Preference overrides the Grammatical Parallelism Preference when in conflict (see examples A and B and both are in turn stronger than the Pronominal Chain Preference (example L  Utterance interpretation depends on the context, and utterance meaning updates the context Four major sources of preference have been identified in the above pronoun interpretation examples The present perspective of preference interactions also extends and explains the role of the attentional state in Grosz and Sidner's (1986) discourse theory The pragmatics subsystem contains sets of preference rules that, in certain combinations, could lead to conflicting preferences Existing logical semantic theories employing dynamic interpretation rules (e The grammatical parallelism of two adjacent utterances in discourse affects the preferred interpretation of pronouns (Kameyama, 1986 tense (Kameyama, Passonneau, and Poesio, 1993 and ellipsis (Pruest, 1992; Kehler, 1993  The discourse model contains a set of information states about situations, eventualities, entities, and the relations among them It also contains the evolving discourse structure, temporal structure, and event structure Both linguistic semantics and commonsense preferences apply on the same discourse model Adverbs too and back trigger conventional presuppositionsabout the input discourse model That is, the utterance Bill hit John back presupposes that it occurred after John hit Bill  Commonsense Knowledge Lascarides and Asher (1993) extend the Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp, 1981) with the interaction of defeasible rules for integrating a new utterance content into the discourse information state The SUBJECT Antecedent Preference and Pronominal Chain Preference result from CENTER, GF ORDER, EXP ORDER, and EXP CENTER These are the defeasible Attentional Rules (ATT) stating the preferred attentional state transitions The Grammatical Parallelism Preference is PARA Conventional presuppositions triggered by too and back are examples of the indefeasible Semantic Rules (SEM) in the grammar constraining the interpretation in the discourse model These are examples of the defeasible Commonsense Rules (WK) stating the preferred discourse model Table 4 identifies the rules that dominate the final interpretation in examples A-L Rules: ATT CENTER, GF ORDER, EXP ORDER, EXP CENTER LF PARA WK HIT, ETC SEM TOO, BACK  General Features The SEM rules are indefeasible whereas all other rules are defeasible What factor determines the interaction pattern among the defeasible rules? The three context components discourse model D, attentional state A, and LF register all have their preferred transitions Take two examples: (1) John met Bill Conflict Resolution Patterns It may be the general pattern of changing preferences during utterance interpretation Let discourse be a sequence of utterances,  The preference interaction patterns discussed here can perhaps be formulated as fine-grained upgrading inferences during utterance interpretation within the proposed utterance interpretation architecture Utterance interpretation induces a complex interaction of defeasible rules in the pragmatics subsystem There are grammatical preferences inducing fast entity-level inferences only indirectly suggesting the preferred discourse model, and commonsense preferences inducing slow proposition-level inferences directly determining the preferred discourse model The attentional state in the context supports the formulation of attentional rules that significantly affect pronoun interpretation preferences Vague predicates and functions represent various expression and construction types whose interpretation depends on the discourse context Preferences are affected by computationally expensive open-ended commonsense inferences The ILF also leaves open how the given utterance is integrated into the temporal, event, and discourse structures in the context
