 Indefinite countable singular noun phrases will take the indefinite article a/an, while indefinite countable plural and uncountable noun phrases will take the zero article  ALT-J/E makes the simplifying assumption that all ASCRIPTIVE noun phrases are indefinite Countable singular noun phrases will therefore take the indefinite article a/an, and countable plural and uncountable noun phrases will take the zero article 9% for referential property and 85 Setting these considerations aside, when we separate our results for noun phrase reference (counting as failures noun phrases with errors in article use, noun phrase reference or the use of possessive determiners and countability and number (counting as failures noun phrases with errors in number or countability our proposed algorithm gave success rates of 74% and 85% respectively The three way distinction in noun phrase reference is used as a base to determine a noun phrase's number and to generate appropriate articles and possessive pronouns when translating from Japanese to English Generic: Noun phrases with generic reference denote an entire class: e Because ascriptive noun phrases are non-referring they cannot be the antecedent of other noun phrases They make no distinction between REFERENTIAL and ASCRIPTIVE for non-generic noun phrases We distinguish between three uses of noun phrases, two referential and one non-referential A noun phrase can be used to refer in two different ways: GENERIC where a noun phrase is used to refer to a whole class, and REFERENTIAL where a noun phrase refers to a particular entity or entities Recall that these rules are only applied if the noun phrase in question is headed by a common noun Although ASCRIPTIVE noun phrases are non-referring, we will refer to all three uses under the general term of noun phrase reference A GENERIC noun phrase (with a countable head noun) can generally be expressed in three ways  This three-way distinction of noun phrase reference was introduced in and used as a base to determine the countability and number of noun phrases in Japanese-to-English machine translation Because the use of GEN is acceptable in all contexts, ALT-J/E generates all GENERIC noun phrases as such, that is as bare noun phrases The number of the noun phrase depends on the countability preference of the noun phrase heading it and there will be no article
