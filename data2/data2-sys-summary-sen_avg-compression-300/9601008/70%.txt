 Determining the referential property of noun phrases is essential not only to understanding a text, but also to decide how to generate it in English This paper proposes a heuristic algorithm to determine the referential properties of noun phrases in a Japanese text Whether or not a REFERENTIAL noun phrase is definite or not is determined using heuristic criteria based on whether there is enough information to uniquely identify the noun phrase's referent, such as the following: if the head noun is marked in the lexicon as being unique: the earth if the noun phrase is made logically unique by a modifier: the best price if the noun phrase's referent is restrictively described: the man who came to dinner, the aim of this research direct and indirect anaphoric reference: I saw a cat and a dog As the above criteria are only meaningful for REFERENTIAL noun phrases, it is essential to determine whether the noun phrase is referential as a first step When it has been determined whether a noun phrase is definite or indefinite, then articles can be generated In the final stage of processing, if there is no determiner, definite noun phrases take the definite article the Indefinite countable singular noun phrases will take the indefinite article a/an, while indefinite countable plural and uncountable noun phrases will take the zero article  The countability and number of ASCRIPTIVE noun phrases matches that of their subject, and the countability and number of two appositive noun phrases match each other as described in , with the following proviso ALT-J/E makes the simplifying assumption that all ASCRIPTIVE noun phrases are indefinite Therefore, articles will be generated in the same way as for indefinite REFERENTIAL noun phrases Countable singular noun phrases will therefore take the indefinite article a/an, and countable plural and uncountable noun phrases will take the zero article  We tested the system on newspaper articles, in the articles tested, there were an average of 7 noun phrases in each sentence We then describe in detail a heuristic method for determining noun phrase reference in Japanese sentences 168 of the 717 noun phrases in the machine translation of the newspaper articles had some problem Next, we show how the distinction is used in a Japanese to English machine translation system to generate articles and number In addition examining even this small sample of text we came up with one major addition to the algorithm for determining noun phrase reference9% for referential property and 85 Setting these considerations aside, when we separate our results for noun phrase reference (counting as failures noun phrases with errors in article use, noun phrase reference or the use of possessive determiners and countability and number (counting as failures noun phrases with errors in number or countability our proposed algorithm gave success rates of 74% and 85% respectively Noun phrase reference is of fundamental importance in any discussion of meaning  The three way distinction in noun phrase reference is used as a base to determine a noun phrase's number and to generate appropriate articles and possessive pronouns when translating from Japanese to English Incorporating this method into the machine translation system ALT-J/E helped to improve the percentage of noun phrases with correctly generated articles and number from 65% to 77  Generic: Noun phrases with generic reference denote an entire class: e In English generic noun phrases can normally be expressed in three ways, as discussed in Section  Referential: Referential noun phrases are those that refer to some entity or entities in the discourse world: e Ascriptive: Ascriptive noun phrases are used with a copular verb, or in an appositive expression, to ascribe a property to their subject: e Because ascriptive noun phrases are non-referring they cannot be the antecedent of other noun phrases If the definition of adjective phrase has been expanded to include ASCRIPTIVE noun phrases then our analysis is compatible They make no distinction between REFERENTIAL and ASCRIPTIVE for non-generic noun phrases In this paper we use the term noun phrase reference to describe the relation between a noun phrase and what it stands for when it is used The algorithm used to determine the referential property of noun phrases headed by common nouns is shown in Figure  We distinguish between three uses of noun phrases, two referential and one non-referential that it is REFERENTIAL A noun phrase can be used to refer in two different ways: GENERIC where a noun phrase is used to refer to a whole class, and REFERENTIAL where a noun phrase refers to a particular entity or entities Finally, appositive noun phrases will be judged to be ASCRIPTIVE, as though they were the complement of a copula Recall that these rules are only applied if the noun phrase in question is headed by a common noun Aoi hall, however, is a proper noun so the rule is not applied The next level of rules (level ) applies to noun phrases modified by embedded sentences This algorithm uses a simple heuristic: a noun phrase modified by a tensed embedded sentence is REFERENTIAL The next level of rules (level ) makes a noun phrase whose head is modified by a demonstrative, numeral or the genitive construction NP-no `NP's' REFERENTIAL Note that only noun phrases modified by no judged to be genitive are REFERENTIAL Although ASCRIPTIVE noun phrases are non-referring, we will refer to all three uses under the general term of noun phrase reference Knowledge of a noun phrase's referential use is essential when translating from Japanese to English, as it plays a large part in determining how a noun phrase is expressed in English A GENERIC noun phrase (with a countable head noun) can generally be expressed in three ways  We call these GEN `a where the noun phrase is indefinite: A mammoth is a mammal; GEN `the where the noun phrase is definite: The mammoth is a mammal; and GEN , where there is no article: Mammoths are mammals This three-way distinction of noun phrase reference was introduced in and used as a base to determine the countability and number of noun phrases in Japanese-to-English machine translation Noun phrases that cannot be used to show GENERIC reference are marked with an asterisk  The use of all three kinds of GENERIC noun phrases is not acceptable in some contexts, for example *a mammoth evolved Because the use of GEN is acceptable in all contexts, ALT-J/E generates all GENERIC noun phrases as such, that is as bare noun phrases The number of the noun phrase depends on the countability preference of the noun phrase heading it and there will be no article The countability and number of REFERENTIAL noun phrases can be determined with heuristics that use information from the Japanese sentence along with knowledge of English countability stored in the lexicon
