 A discourse strategy is a strategy for communicating with another agent Depending on the preceding discourse, and the agent's attentional capacity, the propositions that an agent knows may or may not be salient when a proposal is made Another hypothetical factor was the relative cost of retrieval and communication These cost parameters support modeling various cognitive architectures, e varying the cost of retrieval models different assumptions about memory Below we vary the relative cost of communication and retrieval Finally, we hypothesized that the Explicit-Warrant strategy may be beneficial if the relationship between the warrant and the proposal must be mutually believed Thus the definition of success for the task is a Design-World parameter: the Standard task does not require a shared warrant, whereas the Zero NonMatching Beliefs task gives a zero score to any negotiated plan without agreed-upon warrants To evaluate PERFORMANCE, we compare the Explicit-Warrant strategy with the All-Implicit strategy in situations where we vary the task requirements, agents' attentional capacity, and the cost of retrieval, inference and communication Since the parameters for cognitive effort are fixed while discourse strategy and AWM settings are varied, we can directly test the benefits of different discourse strategies under different assumptions about cognitive effort and the cognitive demands of the task This section discusses the results of comparing the Explicit-Warrant discourse strategy with the All-Implicit discourse strategy to determine when each strategy is BENEFICIAL One strategy that supports deliberation is the Explicit-Warrant strategy, as in 0 Differences in performance between the Explicit-Warrant strategy and the All-Implicit strategy are shown via a DIFFERENCE PLOT such as figure  Dialogues in which one or both agents use the Explicit-Warrant strategy are more efficient when retrieval has a cost Figure shows that the Explicit-Warrant strategy is DETRIMENTAL at AWM of 3,4,5 for the Standard task, in comparison with the All-Implicit strategy, if retrieval from memory is free (KS 3,4,5 ] 19, p [  This is because making the warrant salient displaces information about other pieces of furniture when agents are attention-limited However, figure shows that Explicit-Warrant is beneficial when retrieval is one tenth the cost of communication and inference23, p [  Other experiments show that even when the relative cost of retrieval is 0001, that Explicit-Warrant is still beneficial at AWM settings of 11 and 16 (KS for 11,16 ] 23 , p [ 23, p[  If communication is expensive compared to retrieval, communication cost can dominate the other benefits If we change the definition of success in the task, we change whether a strategy is beneficial23 for AWM from 2 to 11, p [  The strategy virtually guarantees that the agents will agree on the reasons for carrying out a particular course of action23, p [  See figure  In other words, even when every extra WARRANT message incurs a penalty of 10 points, if the task is Zero-NonMatching-Beliefs, agents using Explicit-Warrant do better This paper has discussed an instance of a general problem in the design of conversational agents: when to include optional information If B is a `helpful' agent (nonautonomous B will accept A's proposal without a warrant when AWM is very limited and warrants are not required to be shared The method used here is a new experimental methodology for computational linguistics that supports testing hypotheses about beneficial discourse strategies ,  To my knowledge, no previous work on dialogue has ever argued that conversational agents' resource limits are a major factor in determining effective conversational strategies in collaboration The results presented here suggest that cooperative strategies cannot be defined in the abstract, but cooperation arises from the interaction of two agents in dialogue Here we compared two discourse strategies: All-Implicit and Explicit-Warrant Although much work remains to be done, there is reason to believe that these results are domain independent Since a warrant makes the dialogue longer, the Explicit-Warrant strategy might be inefficient whenever either of these situations hold He's Indian whether the warrant is already accessible in B's working memory ,  Some tasks require that two agents agree on the reasons for adopting a proposal, e Figure summarizes these hypotheses by proposing a hypothetical decision tree for an agent's choice of whether to use the Explicit-Warrant strategy Design-World is an experimental environment for testing the relationship between discourse strategies, task parameters and agents' cognitive capabilities, similar to the single agent TileWorld simulation environment ,  Design-World agents can be parametrized as to discourse strategy, and the effects of this strategy can be measured against a range of cognitive and task parameters This paper compares the Explicit-Warrant strategy to the All-Implicit strategy as strategies for supporting deliberation (reject agent-kim agent-bill option-56: put-act (agent-kim purple couch room-1 On receiving a proposal, an agent deliberates whether to ACCEPT or REJECT the proposal  The Design-World experiments reported here compare the All-Implicit strategy with the Explicit-Warrant strategy Agents are parametrized for different discourse strategies by placing different expansions of discourse plans in their plan libraries The All-Implicit strategy is an expansion of a discourse plan to make a PROPOSAL, in which a PROPOSAL decomposes trivially to the communicative act of PROPOSE The All-Implicit strategy never includes warrants in proposals, leaving it up to the other agent to retrieve them from memory The Explicit-Warrant strategy expands the PROPOSAL discourse act to be a WARRANT followed by a PROPOSE utterance This paper presents a new experimental method for determining whether a discourse strategy is effective and presents experimental results on a strategy for supporting deliberation
