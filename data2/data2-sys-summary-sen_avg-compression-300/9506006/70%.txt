 For example French may have tags to discriminate gender whereas English does not Our earlier example of parallel CLAWS/ICE tagging of the Spoken English Corpus illustrates the fuzziness in the distinction between proper noun and common noun However, notice that Perspective, the second word in the corpus, is tagged NP However, tagsets of English do not necessarily mutually cover all features For instance, the British component of the International Corpus of English has a tagging scheme that accounts for transitivity of verbs whereas the Lancaster/Oslo Bergen corpus does not (nor do the EAGLES proposals - see below  As a development and testing resource, we are using the text of the Lancaster-IBM Spoken English Corpus (SEC)  The corpus exists in several forms and annotations: the digitised acoustic waveform; the graphemic transcription annotated with prosodic markings; and a part-of-speech analysis that was annotated semi-automatically with the aid of CLAWS , as used for the LOB corpus For example, the corpus could have copyright restrictions or could be collected for dictionary compilation As annotating corpora using hand-crafted markup or some semi-automated process followed by correction by linguistic experts is slow and expensive , it would be preferable if some other method of building a large annotated corpus could be found We also have the software used for annotating the University of Pennsylvania corpus , and the International Corpus of English ,  The first column reveals if we have the corpus itself: we have all but the International Corpus of English The last column marks the London-Lund and Brown corpus with a `1' to indicate that we have a small sample of corpus annotated using both these schemes The `2' marker in this column indicates the Parallel Annotated Corpus that we are building at the moment by adding the International Ccorpus English (GB) annotation to the Spoken English Corpus Develop the most accurate mapping between the new scheme and one of the schemes already in the mapping suite Annotate the Spoken English Corpus using the mapping Correct the mapped annotation, preferably using advice from the people responsible for the annotation scheme The uneven spread of resources means that alternative mapping strategies must be adopted when including each annotation scheme (see table 1  As we have the software used to tag and parse the International Corpus of English we can incorporate that into the mapping We require a method to evaluate the alternative mapping strategies: A simple evaluation can be accomplished by tagging the untagged SEC using one annotation scheme (the evaluation scheme) by the tried and tested method of automatic annotation followed by hand correction To test a mapping strategy one would apply the mapping from the evaluation scheme tags to produce those of the SEC The success of the mapping would be determined by measuring the difference between this annotation and the original SEC (CLAWS tagged) annotation produced by Lancaster The Parallel Annotated Corpus (PAC) created when a (non-CLAWS) evaluation scheme is used to tag the Spoken English Corpus in this way itself provides further possibilities for developing mapping strategies The AMALGAM (automatic mapping among lexico-grammatical annotation models) project was set up to research ways of mapping between annotation schemes in order to increase the size of corpus tagged with the schemes included in the project ,  The PAC may intrinsically encode mapping information that would not be uncovered from other mapping strategies Extracting a mapping from a PAC is computationally trivial; the difficulty is annotating an existing corpus with a new scheme However, PACs already exist for pairs of annotation scheme and this provides an easy way to extract mapping information This is particularly true when the annotation scheme of one corpus is replaced by another However, the addition of the new scheme to part of the corpus creates a PAC from which a mapping can be derived The mapping could be used to update the performance of the automatic annotator We are developing a multi-tagged corpus and a multi-treebank, a single text-set annotated with all the tagging and parsing schemes we include in the mappings Often a corpus is annotated with a scheme that the designers feel can be improved so they annotate the same texts with the updated scheme An example PAC comprises a few sections of the Brown corpus that were annotated by additional London-Lund markup  A further example is the Nijmegen Corpus which was originally annotated with CCPP annotation but later replaced with the scheme used to annotate the British component of the International Corpus of English  To use the method of deriving mappings from PACs it is inevitable that some traditional tagging is required to build the parallel corpus The text-set is the Spoken English Corpus (SEC which is already annotated with two syntax schemes As we aimed to produce the multitagged corpus out of the texts of the Spoken English Corpus it made sense to annotate the Spoken English Corpus with ICE tags We employed an experienced annotator of corpora, Tim Willis, to learn the ICE annotation scheme and apply it to the Spoken English Corpus by editing the automatic output of the Nijmegen parser which was designed to annotate ICE-GB material For the moment we are concentrating on deriving mappings between tagged annotation but it was felt more cost effective to parse and tag the Spoken English Corpus now as our project will eventually include parse mappings The output from the Nijmegen parser needs to be aligned with the markup in the Spoken English Corpus The Spoken English Corpus has sentence boundaries after full stops, exclamation marks and question marks whereas the Nijmegen parser additionally delimits text separated by colons and semicolons The Nijmegen parser and The Spoken English Corpus tagging scheme deal with enclitics in a similar manner; a word like who's being split into the separate items who and 's To be aligned with the Spoken English Corpus would require the word and its corresponding tag to to be split On the other hand, a proper noun such as New York may be assigned a single tag and treated as a single item rather than having the two words treated individually as in the Spoken English Corpus The first few lines of the Spoken English Corpus when aligned with the ICE tags of the same text are shown figure 1, above The Spoken English Corpus contains the short header: (In Perspective Rosemary Hill
