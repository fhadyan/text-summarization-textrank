 Our earlier example of parallel CLAWS/ICE tagging of the Spoken English Corpus illustrates the fuzziness in the distinction between proper noun and common noun As a development and testing resource, we are using the text of the Lancaster-IBM Spoken English Corpus (SEC)  We also have the software used for annotating the University of Pennsylvania corpus , and the International Corpus of English ,  The first column reveals if we have the corpus itself: we have all but the International Corpus of English The `2' marker in this column indicates the Parallel Annotated Corpus that we are building at the moment by adding the International Ccorpus English (GB) annotation to the Spoken English Corpus Annotate the Spoken English Corpus using the mapping As we have the software used to tag and parse the International Corpus of English we can incorporate that into the mapping The Parallel Annotated Corpus (PAC) created when a (non-CLAWS) evaluation scheme is used to tag the Spoken English Corpus in this way itself provides further possibilities for developing mapping strategies The AMALGAM (automatic mapping among lexico-grammatical annotation models) project was set up to research ways of mapping between annotation schemes in order to increase the size of corpus tagged with the schemes included in the project ,  This is particularly true when the annotation scheme of one corpus is replaced by another A further example is the Nijmegen Corpus which was originally annotated with CCPP annotation but later replaced with the scheme used to annotate the British component of the International Corpus of English  The text-set is the Spoken English Corpus (SEC which is already annotated with two syntax schemes As we aimed to produce the multitagged corpus out of the texts of the Spoken English Corpus it made sense to annotate the Spoken English Corpus with ICE tags The output from the Nijmegen parser needs to be aligned with the markup in the Spoken English Corpus To be aligned with the Spoken English Corpus would require the word and its corresponding tag to to be split The Spoken English Corpus contains the short header: (In Perspective Rosemary Hill
