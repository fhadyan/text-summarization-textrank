 For those that did (mean length 207 words the APB was now 1 number of parses, due to some longer sentences being assigned many more parses With a more constrained (subcategorised) syntactic grammar, many of these examples would not have received any global syntactic analysis 250 sentences from the new treebank were kept back for testing Table shows the results of this test with respect to the original Susanne bracketings using the Grammar Evaluation Interest Group scheme (GEIG, see e Harrison et al 1991  Schabes et al In addition, Schabes et al However, it seems likely that say rule-to-rule semantic interpretation will be easier with hand-constructed grammars with an explicit, determinate ruleset27 more crossing brackets per sentence These results indicate clearly that punctuation and text grammatical constraints can play an important role in parse selection Secondly, removal of punctuation from the input (after segmentation into text sentences) worsens performance as punctuation both reduces syntactic ambiguity (Jones, 1994) and signals non-syntactic (discourse) relations between text units (Nunberg, 1990  The experiments show that grammatical coverage can be greatly increased by relaxing subcategorisation constraints, and that text grammatical or punctuation-cued constraints can reduce ambiguity and increase coverage during parsing This grammar compiles into a DCG-like grammar of approximately 400 rules The rules of the text grammar divide into three groups: those introducing text-sentences, those defining text adjunct introduction and those defining text adjuncts (Nunberg, 1990  The text grammar has been tested on Susanne and covers 998% of sentences (The failures are mostly text segmentation problems  Therefore, a text sentence containing eight commas (and no other punctuation) will have 3170 analyses Despite Nunberg's observation that text grammar is distinct from syntax, text grammatical ambiguity favours interleaved application of text grammatical and syntactic constraints1] and 1239[22 Black et al 1993:156) quote a parse base of 16 seconds each, whilst those around 60 tokens take on average 45 seconds Jones (1994) reports a preliminary experiment evaluating reduction of ambiguity by punctuation The APB for this set was 1273, mean length 22
