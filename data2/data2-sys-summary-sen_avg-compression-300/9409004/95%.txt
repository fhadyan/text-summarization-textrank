 Noise The class accumulates enough evidence provided by erroneously extracted triples Almost one correct semantic class for each syntactic position in the sample is acquired4% of the senses g Table  Since different verb senses occur in the corpus, the SRs acquired appear mixed In this way, the syntactic position also would provide information (statistical evidence) for measuring the most appropriate classes Output The result of the learning process is a set of syntactic SRs, (verb, syntactic relationship, semantic class  Semantic classes are represented extensionally as sets of nouns Previous knowledge used In the process of learning SRs, the system needs to know how words are clustered in semantic classes, and how semantic classes are hierarchically organized Let be the sets of all verbs, nouns, syntactic positions, and possible noun classes, respectively We used Wordnet as the verb and noun lexicons for the lemmatizer, and also as the semantic taxonomy for clustering nouns in semantic classes
