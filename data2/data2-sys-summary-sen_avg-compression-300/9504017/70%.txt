 Most linguistic approaches account for the defeasibility of pragmatic inferences by analyzing them in a context that consists of all or some of the previous utterances, including the current one The models yield Mary came to the party; Chris is a male; and Chris is an adult as pragmatic inferences of utterance (  Consider now utterance (  We have already mentioned that speech repairs constitute a good benchmark for studying the generation and cancellation of pragmatic inferences along sequences of utterances  Context , , procedural rules , , lexical and syntactic structure , intentions , or anaphoric constraints , decide what presuppositions or implicatures are projected as pragmatic inferences for the utterance that is analyzed Mary knows that John Smith is a married male, so the utterance makes sense for her (13) a He is only five years old (14) John is a male adult The problem with these approaches is that they assign a dual life to pragmatic inferences: in the initial stage, as members of a simple or complex utterance, they are defeasible The warning is conveyed by implicature (15) The hearer misunderstood the speaker The same methodology can be applied to modeling conversational implicatures in indirect replies  Our approach does not exhibit these constraints Therefore, the implicature at the end of the dialogue is that the conversant who answered went shopping When such a set of conditions is met, that inference is drawn, but it is assigned a defeasible status An extended definition of satisfaction and a notion of optimism with respect to different interpretations yield the preferred interpretations for an utterance or sequences of utterances The formalism yields an algorithm that has been implemented in Common Lisp with Screamer One way of accounting for cancellations that occur later in the analyzed text is simply to extend the boundaries within which pragmatic inferences are evaluated, i Another way of allowing pragmatic inferences to be cancelled is to assign them the status of defeasible information To recognize normal state implicatures one must consider mutual beliefs and plans  Computational approaches fail to account for the cancellation of pragmatic inferences: once presuppositions or implicatures , are generated, they can never be cancelled We are not aware of any formalism or computational approach that offers a unified explanation for the cancellability of pragmatic inferences in general, and of no approach that handles cancellations that occur in sequences of utterances It is the role of context and knowledge of the conversants to decide whether that inference will survive or not as a pragmatic inference of the structure We put no boundaries upon the time when such a cancellation can occur, and we offer a unified explanation for pragmatic inferences that are inferable when simple utterances, complex utterances, or sequences of utterances are considered To understand conversational implicatures associated with indirect replies one must consider discourse expectations, discourse plans, and discourse relations ,  We then show how different classes of pragmatic inferences can be captured using this formalism, and how our algorithm computes the expected results for a representative class of pragmatic inferences Stratified logic supports one type of indefeasible information and two types of defeasible information, namely, infelicitously defeasible and felicitously defeasible Pragmatic inferences are triggered by utterances This theory yields the following definition: Let be a theory described in terms of stratified first-order logic that appropriately formalizes the semantics of lexical items and the necessary conditions that trigger pragmatic inferences The semantics of lexical terms is formalized using the quantifier , while the necessary conditions that pertain to pragmatic inferences are captured using  Let uttered(u) be the logical translation of a given utterance or set of utterances We say that utterance u p if and only if p[d] or p[i] is derived using pragmatic inferences in at least one optimistic model of the theory , and if pis not cancelled by any stronger information ( ) in any optimistic model schema of the theory Symmetrically, one can define what a negative pragmatic inference is Our algorithm, described in detail by Marcu , takes as input a set of first-order stratified formulas that represents an adequate knowledge base that expresses semantic knowledge and the necessary conditions for triggering pragmatic inferences, and the translation of an utterance or set of utterances uttered(u  Among them, the defeasible inferences that have been triggered on pragmatic grounds are checked to see whether or not they are cancelled in any optimistic interpretation Those that are not cancelled are labelled as pragmatic inferences for the given utterance or set of utterances We present a set of examples that covers a representative group of pragmatic inferences Therefore, an appropriate formalization of utterance ( ) and the requisite pragmatic knowledge will be as shown in (  Model m0 explains why Mary came to the party is a presupposition for utterance (  Consider utterance ( and its implicatures (  (7) The theory provides one optimistic model schema (figure ) that reflects the expected pragmatic inferences, i In fact all of them went to the theatre nBy adding the extra utterance to the initial theory ( uttered(went(all(boys theatre one would obtain one optimistic model schema in which the conventional implicatures have been cancelled (see figure  Consider the following utterances and some of their associated presuppositions ( ) (the symbol precedes an inference drawn on pragmatic grounds (9) Either Chris is not a bachelor or he regrets that Mary came to the party We can taxonomize previous approaches to defeasible pragmatic inferences into three categories (we omit here work on defeasibility related to linguistic phenomena such as discourse, anaphora, or speech acts  Chris is not a bachelor presupposes that Chris is a male adult; Chris regrets that Mary came to the party presupposes that Mary came to the party However, when one examines utterance ( one observes immediately that there is a contradiction between the presuppositions carried by the individual components An appropriate formalization for utterance ( ) and the necessary semantic and pragmatic knowledge is given in (
