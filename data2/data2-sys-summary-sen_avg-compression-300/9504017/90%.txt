 The models yield Mary came to the party; Chris is a male; and Chris is an adult as pragmatic inferences of utterance (  (13) a (14) John is a male adult (15) The hearer misunderstood the speaker Our approach does not exhibit these constraints Therefore, the implicature at the end of the dialogue is that the conversant who answered went shopping The formalism yields an algorithm that has been implemented in Common Lisp with Screamer Another way of allowing pragmatic inferences to be cancelled is to assign them the status of defeasible information Computational approaches fail to account for the cancellation of pragmatic inferences: once presuppositions or implicatures , are generated, they can never be cancelled We put no boundaries upon the time when such a cancellation can occur, and we offer a unified explanation for pragmatic inferences that are inferable when simple utterances, complex utterances, or sequences of utterances are considered To understand conversational implicatures associated with indirect replies one must consider discourse expectations, discourse plans, and discourse relations ,  We then show how different classes of pragmatic inferences can be captured using this formalism, and how our algorithm computes the expected results for a representative class of pragmatic inferences Stratified logic supports one type of indefeasible information and two types of defeasible information, namely, infelicitously defeasible and felicitously defeasible Pragmatic inferences are triggered by utterances The semantics of lexical terms is formalized using the quantifier , while the necessary conditions that pertain to pragmatic inferences are captured using  Let uttered(u) be the logical translation of a given utterance or set of utterances Symmetrically, one can define what a negative pragmatic inference is Those that are not cancelled are labelled as pragmatic inferences for the given utterance or set of utterances We present a set of examples that covers a representative group of pragmatic inferences (7) The theory provides one optimistic model schema (figure ) that reflects the expected pragmatic inferences, i
