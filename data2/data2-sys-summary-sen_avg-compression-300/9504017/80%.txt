 Most linguistic approaches account for the defeasibility of pragmatic inferences by analyzing them in a context that consists of all or some of the previous utterances, including the current one The models yield Mary came to the party; Chris is a male; and Chris is an adult as pragmatic inferences of utterance (  We have already mentioned that speech repairs constitute a good benchmark for studying the generation and cancellation of pragmatic inferences along sequences of utterances  Context , , procedural rules , , lexical and syntactic structure , intentions , or anaphoric constraints , decide what presuppositions or implicatures are projected as pragmatic inferences for the utterance that is analyzed (13) a He is only five years old (14) John is a male adult The problem with these approaches is that they assign a dual life to pragmatic inferences: in the initial stage, as members of a simple or complex utterance, they are defeasible (15) The hearer misunderstood the speaker The same methodology can be applied to modeling conversational implicatures in indirect replies  Our approach does not exhibit these constraints Therefore, the implicature at the end of the dialogue is that the conversant who answered went shopping An extended definition of satisfaction and a notion of optimism with respect to different interpretations yield the preferred interpretations for an utterance or sequences of utterances The formalism yields an algorithm that has been implemented in Common Lisp with Screamer One way of accounting for cancellations that occur later in the analyzed text is simply to extend the boundaries within which pragmatic inferences are evaluated, i Another way of allowing pragmatic inferences to be cancelled is to assign them the status of defeasible information Computational approaches fail to account for the cancellation of pragmatic inferences: once presuppositions or implicatures , are generated, they can never be cancelled We put no boundaries upon the time when such a cancellation can occur, and we offer a unified explanation for pragmatic inferences that are inferable when simple utterances, complex utterances, or sequences of utterances are considered To understand conversational implicatures associated with indirect replies one must consider discourse expectations, discourse plans, and discourse relations ,  We then show how different classes of pragmatic inferences can be captured using this formalism, and how our algorithm computes the expected results for a representative class of pragmatic inferences Stratified logic supports one type of indefeasible information and two types of defeasible information, namely, infelicitously defeasible and felicitously defeasible Pragmatic inferences are triggered by utterances This theory yields the following definition: Let be a theory described in terms of stratified first-order logic that appropriately formalizes the semantics of lexical items and the necessary conditions that trigger pragmatic inferences The semantics of lexical terms is formalized using the quantifier , while the necessary conditions that pertain to pragmatic inferences are captured using  Let uttered(u) be the logical translation of a given utterance or set of utterances Symmetrically, one can define what a negative pragmatic inference is Our algorithm, described in detail by Marcu , takes as input a set of first-order stratified formulas that represents an adequate knowledge base that expresses semantic knowledge and the necessary conditions for triggering pragmatic inferences, and the translation of an utterance or set of utterances uttered(u  Among them, the defeasible inferences that have been triggered on pragmatic grounds are checked to see whether or not they are cancelled in any optimistic interpretation Those that are not cancelled are labelled as pragmatic inferences for the given utterance or set of utterances We present a set of examples that covers a representative group of pragmatic inferences (7) The theory provides one optimistic model schema (figure ) that reflects the expected pragmatic inferences, i We can taxonomize previous approaches to defeasible pragmatic inferences into three categories (we omit here work on defeasibility related to linguistic phenomena such as discourse, anaphora, or speech acts  An appropriate formalization for utterance ( ) and the necessary semantic and pragmatic knowledge is given in (
