 The error surface vowels are written in italics The morphological analysis proceeds by selecting rules that hypothesise lexical strings for a given surface string Variables introduced by error rules into the surface string are then instantiated by associating surface with lexical, and matching lexical strings to the lexicon tree(s  The error rules capture the correspondence between the error surface and the correct surface, given the surrounding partition into surface and lexical contexts The lexical level maintains three lexical tapes , : pattern tape, root tape and vocalism tape; each tape scans a lexical tree A vowel shift error rule will be tried with a partition on a (short) vowel which is not an expected (lexical) vowel at that position The rule deletes the vowel from the surface
