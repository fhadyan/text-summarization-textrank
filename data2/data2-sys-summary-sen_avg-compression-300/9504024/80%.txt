 It is deleted from the surface The LEX element is a tuple itself of [PATTERN, ROOT, VOCALISM  In E0 the shifted vowel was analysed earlier as an omitted stem vowel (om_stmv whereas in E1 it was analysed earlier as an omitted spread vowel (om_sprv  The `E0's on the rule number line indicate where the vowel shift rule was applied to replace an error surface vowel with  The error surface vowels are written in italics The morphological analysis proceeds by selecting rules that hypothesise lexical strings for a given surface string The rules are accepted/rejected by checking that the lexical string(s) can extend along the lexical tree(s) from the current position(s  Variables introduced by error rules into the surface string are then instantiated by associating surface with lexical, and matching lexical strings to the lexicon tree(s  For example, the Syriac root {ktb} takes the perfect vowel , e /n et  A consonantal segment may be omitted from the surface form, but maintained in the surface from For example, Syriac The application of a morphographemic rule may have constraints as on which lexical morphemes it may or may not apply The operator caters for obligatory rules In the multi-tape version, lexical expressions (i The error rules capture the correspondence between the error surface and the correct surface, given the surrounding partition into surface and lexical contexts The error rules are then considered when ordinary morphological rules fail If no error rules succeed, or lead to a successful partition of the word, analysis backtracks to try the error rules at successively earlier points in the word The exception occurs with a vowel shift error (  If this error rule succeeds, an expectation of further shifted vowels is set up, but no other error rule is allowed in the subsequent partitions Once an error rule is selected, the corrected surface is substituted for the error surface, and normal analysis continues - at the same position Subsection presents error checking The lexical level maintains three lexical tapes , : pattern tape, root tape and vocalism tape; each tape scans a lexical tree Each lexical expression is a triple; lexical expressions with one symbol assume on the remaining positions (4) gives three general rules: R0 allows any character on the first lexical tape to surface, e Similarly, R2 states that any P {v1, v2} on the pattern tape and V on vocalism tape with no transition on the root tape corresponds to V on the surface tape; this rule sanctions vowels The numbers between the surface tape and the lexical tapes indicate the rules which sanction the moves R6 sanctions the spreading of the first vowel Below are outlined error rules resulting from peculiarly Semitic problems A vowel shift error rule will be tried with a partition on a (short) vowel which is not an expected (lexical) vowel at that position A vowel is considered shifted if the same vowel has been omitted earlier in the word The rule deletes the vowel from the surface In the rules above, `X' is the shifted vowel
