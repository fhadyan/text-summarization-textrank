 The Zero-Nonmatching-Beliefs task is designed to investigate the effect of the level of agreement that agents must achieve01 respectively, and the parameters that are varied are (1) communication strategy; (2) task definition; and (3) AWM settings Strategies may be neither BENEFICIAL or DETRIMENTAL, since there may be no difference between two strategies In the comparisons below, strategy 1 is either Close-Consequence or Explicit-Warrant and strategy 2 is the All-Implicit strategy Then we compare across strategies for a particular task, showing that the interaction of the strategy and task varies according to the strategy19, p [  In contrast, if the task is the fault-intolerant Zero-Invalids task, then the Close-Consequence strategy is BENEFICIAL19, p [ 3, p [  This is because IRUs displace other facts from AWM Figure shows that Explicit-Warrant is beneficial in the Standard task at AWM values of 3 and above Here, the scores improve because the beliefs necessary for deliberating the proposal are made available in the current context with each proposal (KS for AWM of 3 and above ] 23, p [ 01 so that agents don't have to search memory for them23 for AWM from 2 to 11, p [  This is due to agents' resource limits, which means that retrieval is indeterminate and that there are costs associated with retrieving warrants from memory At high AWM the differences between the two strategies are small Design-World uses similar methods to test a theory of the effect of resource limits on communicative behavior between two agents Design-World is also based on the method used in Carletta's JAM simulation for the Edinburgh Map-Task  Given good error recovery strategies, Carletta argues that `high risk' strategies are more efficient, where efficiency is a measure of the number of utterances in the dialogue We showed that strategies that are inefficient under assumptions of perfect reasoners with unlimited attention and retrieval are effective with resource limited agents Furthermore, different tasks make different cognitive demands, and place different requirements on agents' collaborative behavior Tasks which require a high level of belief coordination can benefit from communicative strategies that include redundancy Fault intolerant tasks benefit from redundancy for rehearsing the effects of actions One problem with this efficiency measure is that it ignores the cognitive effort required by resource limited agents in collaborative problem solving In order to test the hypothesized relationship of communicative strategies to agents' resource limits we developed a test-bed environment, Design-World, in which we vary task requirements, agents' resources and communicative strategies Our artificial agents are based on a cognitive model of attention and memory Our experimental results show that communicative strategies that incorporate IRUs can help resource-limited cognitive agents coordinate, limit processing, and improve the quality and robustness of the problem solution The Design-World task consists of two agents who carry out a dialogue in order to come to an agreement on a furniture layout design for a two room house  Agents start with private beliefs about the furniture items they have and their colors See figure  The Attention/Working Memory model, AWM, is adapted from  The radius of the search sphere in the AWM model is used as the parameter for Design-World agents' resource-bound on attentional capacity When agents have limited working memory, then only a limited number of items can be SALIENT, i This means that mistakes that agents make in their planning process have a plausible cognitive basis A COMMUNICATIVE STRATEGY is a strategy for communicating with another agent, which varies according to the agents' initiative, amount of information about the task, degree of resource-bounds, and communication style , , ,  Design-World agents communicate with an artificial language whose primitive communicative acts are PROPOSE, ACCEPT, REJECT, SAY See figure  accessible in working memory The variation in the degree of explicitness of a discourse act is the basis of agents' communicative strategies (propose agent-bill agent-kim option-43: put-act (agent-bill green rug room-1 [2 KIM: Then, let's put the green lamp in the study (reject agent-bill agent-kim option-75: put-act (agent-bill green couch room-1  See figure  Agents parameterized with the All-Implicit strategy do not include IRUs in any discourse act or produce any discourse acts labelled as potentially implicit in figure  Agents parameterized with the Close-Consequence and Explicit-Warrant strategies include IRUs at dialogue segment closings and in proposals In dialogue 1 agent CLC uses the Close-Consequence strategy (propose agent-bill agent-clc option-30: put-act (agent-bill green rug room-1 [2 CLC: So, we've agreed to put the green rug in the study (close agent-clc agent-bill intended-30: put-act (agent-bill green rug room-1 [3 CLC: AGENT-BILL DOESN'T HAVE GREEN RUG The Explicit-Warrant strategy varies the proposal discourse act by including WARRANT IRUs in each proposal The Explicit-Warrant strategy also occurs in natural dialogues
