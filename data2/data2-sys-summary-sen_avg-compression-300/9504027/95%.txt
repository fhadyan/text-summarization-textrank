 The deletion of a maximal TNCB removes two ill-formed nodes (figure  When two maximal TNCBs are conjoined, nodes dominating the new node, which were previously ill-formed, become undetermined When we adjoin a maximal TNCB within another TNCB, nodes dominating the new well-formed node are disrupted And nodes dominating the maximal disrupted node, which were previously ill-formed, may become well-formed after re-evaluation We thus see that rewriting and re-evaluating must improve the TNCB O(n[2  Transfer specifications may be incrementally refined and empirically tested for efficiency In other words, a maximal TNCB is a largest well-formed component of a TNCB Conjunction: A maximal TNCB can be conjoined with another maximal TNCB if they may be combined by rule Adjunction: A maximal TNCB can be inserted inside a maximal TNCB, i In the left-hand figure, we assume we wish to move the maximal TNCB 4 next to the maximal TNCB 7 The Shake-and-Bake generation algorithm of combines target language signs using the technique known as generate-and-test We enter the rewrite phase, then, with an ill-formed TNCB
