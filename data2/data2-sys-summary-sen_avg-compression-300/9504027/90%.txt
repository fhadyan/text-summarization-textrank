 The deletion of a maximal TNCB removes two ill-formed nodes (figure  When two maximal TNCBs are conjoined, nodes dominating the new node, which were previously ill-formed, become undetermined When re-evaluated, they may remain ill-formed or some may now become well-formed When we adjoin a maximal TNCB within another TNCB, nodes dominating the new well-formed node are disrupted And nodes dominating the maximal disrupted node, which were previously ill-formed, may become well-formed after re-evaluation We thus see that rewriting and re-evaluating must improve the TNCB We then scan the TNCB, say top-down from left to right, looking for a maximal TNCB to move This can never exceed the number of interior nodes of the TNCB formed from n lexical signs (i O(n[2  The combined complexity of the test-rewrite cycle is thus O(n[3  Transfer specifications may be incrementally refined and empirically tested for efficiency Our novel generation algorithm has polynomial complexity (O(n[4  In other words, a maximal TNCB is a largest well-formed component of a TNCB We define five operations on a TNCB Conjunction: A maximal TNCB can be conjoined with another maximal TNCB if they may be combined by rule The new node, 7, is well-formed A lexical-semantic transfer phase which employs the bilingual dictionary to map the bag of instantiated source signs onto a bag of target language signs Adjunction: A maximal TNCB can be inserted inside a maximal TNCB, i In figure , the TNCB composed of nodes 1, 2, and 3 is inserted inside the TNCB composed of nodes 4, 5 and 6 In the left-hand figure, we assume we wish to move the maximal TNCB 4 next to the maximal TNCB 7 A generation phase which imposes an order on the bag of target signs which is guaranteed grammatical according to the monolingual target grammar If a maximal TNCB is adjoined at the highest possible place inside another TNCB, the result will be well-formed after it is re-evaluated The Shake-and-Bake generation algorithm of combines target language signs using the technique known as generate-and-test We enter the rewrite phase, then, with an ill-formed TNCB
