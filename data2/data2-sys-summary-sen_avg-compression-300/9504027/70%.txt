 The deletion of a maximal TNCB removes two ill-formed nodes (figure  At the deletion site, a new undetermined node is created, which may or may not be ill-formed When two maximal TNCBs are conjoined, nodes dominating the new node, which were previously ill-formed, become undetermined When re-evaluated, they may remain ill-formed or some may now become well-formed When we adjoin a maximal TNCB within another TNCB, nodes dominating the new well-formed node are disrupted By dominance monotonicity, all nodes which were disrupted by the adjunction must become well-formed after re-evaluation And nodes dominating the maximal disrupted node, which were previously ill-formed, may become well-formed after re-evaluation We thus see that rewriting and re-evaluating must improve the TNCB After the test phase, we discover that every single interior node is ill-formed We then scan the TNCB, say top-down from left to right, looking for a maximal TNCB to move Once again, the test phase fails to provide a well-formed TNCB, so we repeat the rewrite phase, this time finding dog to conjoin with the (figure shows the state just after the second pass through the test phase  After further testing, we again re-enter the rewrite phase and this time note that brown can be inserted in the maximal TNCB the dog barked adjoined with dog (figure  Since it will combine with brown dog, no adjunction to a lower TNCB is attempted The final result is the TNCB in figure , whose orthography is the big brown dog barked  Even if generation ultimately fails, maximal well-formed fragments will have been built; the latter may be presented to the user, allowing graceful degradation of output quality This can never exceed the number of interior nodes of the TNCB formed from n lexical signs (i Consequently, the better formed the initial TNCB used by the generator, the fewer the number of rewrites required to complete generation O(n[2  The combined complexity of the test-rewrite cycle is thus O(n[3  Now, in section , we argued that no more than n-1 rewrites would ever be necessary, thus the overall complexity of generation (even when no solution is found) is O(n[4  Transfer specifications may be incrementally refined and empirically tested for efficiency The transfer module is free to attempt structural transfer in order to produce the best possible first guess Our novel generation algorithm has polynomial complexity (O(n[4  The reduction in theoretical complexity is achieved by placing constraints on the power of the target grammar when operating on instantiated signs, and by using a more restrictive data structure than a bag, which we call a target language normalised commutative bracketing (TNCB  A TNCB records dominance information from derivations and is amenable to incremental updates The crucial data structure that it employs is the TNCB Whitelock's Shake-and-Bake generation algorithm attempts to arrange the bag of target signs until a grammatical ordering (an ordering which allows all of the signs to combine to yield a single sign) is found However, the target derivation information itself is not used to assist the algorithm Shake-and-Bake translation assumes a source grammar, a target grammar and a bilingual dictionary which relates translationally equivalent sets of lexical signs, carrying across the semantic dependencies established by the source language analysis stage into the target language generation stage Undetermined TNCBs are commutative, e A TNCB is well-formed iff its value is a sign, ill-formed iff its value is INCONSISTENT, undetermined (and its value is UNDETERMINED) iff it has not been demonstrated whether it is well-formed or ill-formed In other words, a maximal TNCB is a largest well-formed component of a TNCB We define five operations on a TNCB Deletion: A maximal TNCB can be deleted from its current position Conjunction: A maximal TNCB can be conjoined with another maximal TNCB if they may be combined by rule In figure , it can be seen how the maximal TNCB composed of nodes 1, 2, and 3 is conjoined with the maximal TNCB composed of nodes 4, 5 and 6 giving the TNCB made up of nodes 1 to 7 The new node, 7, is well-formed A lexical-semantic transfer phase which employs the bilingual dictionary to map the bag of instantiated source signs onto a bag of target language signs Adjunction: A maximal TNCB can be inserted inside a maximal TNCB, i conjoined with a non-maximal TNCB, where the combination is licensed by rule In figure , the TNCB composed of nodes 1, 2, and 3 is inserted inside the TNCB composed of nodes 4, 5 and 6 All nodes (only 8 in figure ) which dominate the node corresponding to the new combination (node 7) must be marked undetermined such nodes are said to be disrupted In the left-hand figure, we assume we wish to move the maximal TNCB 4 next to the maximal TNCB 7 This first involves deleting TNCB 4 (noting it and raising node 3 to replace node 2 A generation phase which imposes an order on the bag of target signs which is guaranteed grammatical according to the monolingual target grammar Evaluation: After a movement, the TNCB is undetermined as demonstrated in figure  Full-scale bag generation is not necessary because sufficient information can be transferred from the source language to severely constrain the subsequent search during generation The two properties required of TNCBs (and hence the target grammars with instantiated lexical signs) are: 1 Precedence Monotonicity This ordering must respect the linguistic constraints which have been transferred into the target signs If a maximal TNCB is adjoined at the highest possible place inside another TNCB, the result will be well-formed after it is re-evaluated Imagine a bag of signs, corresponding to the big brown dog barked has been passed to the generation phase The first step in the generation process is to convert it into some arbitrary TNCB structure, say the one in figure  The Shake-and-Bake generation algorithm of combines target language signs using the technique known as generate-and-test In order to verify whether this structure is valid, we evaluate the TNCB If the TNCB evaluates successfully, the orthography of its value is the desired result If we were continuing in the spirit of the original Shake-and-Bake generation process, we would now form some arbitrary mutation of the TNCB and retest, repeating this test-rewrite cycle until we either found a well-formed TNCB or failed We enter the rewrite phase, then, with an ill-formed TNCB
