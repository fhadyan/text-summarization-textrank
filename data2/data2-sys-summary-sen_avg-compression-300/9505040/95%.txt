 Rules were then automatically learned that updated these chunk structure tags based on neighboring words and their part-of-speech and chunk tags The cross product of the 20 word and part-of-speech patterns with the 5 chunk tag patterns determined the full set of 100 templates used Rules 4-6 are similar to Rule 2, marking the initial words of baseNPs that directly follow another baseNP To gloss a few of these, in the first rule here, determiners (with part-of-speech tag DT which usually begin N chunks and thus are assigned the baseline tag BN, have their chunk tags changed to N if they follow a word whose tag is also BN These two kinds of chunk structure derived from the Treebank data were encoded as chunk tags attached to each word and provided the targets for the transformation-based learning Transformational learning begins with some initial baseline prediction, which here means a baseline assignment of chunk tags to words Reasonable suggestions for baseline heuristics after a text has been tagged for part-of-speech might include assigning to each word the chunk tag that it carried most frequently in the training set, or assigning each part-of-speech tag the chunk tag that was most frequently associated with that part-of-speech tag in the training The source texts were then run through Brill's part-of-speech tagger , and, as a baseline heuristic, chunk structure tags were assigned to each word based on its part-of-speech tag In the text chunking application, the tags being assigned are chunk structure tags, while the part-of-speech tags are a fixed part of the environment, like the lexical identities of the words themselves
