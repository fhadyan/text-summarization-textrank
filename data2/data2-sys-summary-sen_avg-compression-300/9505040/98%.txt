 Rules were then automatically learned that updated these chunk structure tags based on neighboring words and their part-of-speech and chunk tags As shown in Fig Reasonable suggestions for baseline heuristics after a text has been tagged for part-of-speech might include assigning to each word the chunk tag that it carried most frequently in the training set, or assigning each part-of-speech tag the chunk tag that was most frequently associated with that part-of-speech tag in the training The source texts were then run through Brill's part-of-speech tagger , and, as a baseline heuristic, chunk structure tags were assigned to each word based on its part-of-speech tag
