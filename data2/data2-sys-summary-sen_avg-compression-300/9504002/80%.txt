 The most common pattern was for a larger tagset to give higher accuracy, but there were notable exceptions in French (where gender marking was the key factor in Swedish unknown words (which show the reverse trend) and in English unknown words (which show no very clear trend at all  The tagger used in the experiments took a very simple-minded approach to unknown words In both cases, very few of the unknown words (less than 1 had more than one tag We have shown how a simple experiment in changing the tagset shows that the relationship between tagset size and accuracy is a weak one and is not consistent against languages The usual approach here is to hypothesise all tags in the tagset for an unknown word, other than ones where all the words that may have the tag can be enumerated in advance (closed class tags  HMM taggers often perform poorly on unknown words Alternative tagsets were derived by taking the initial tagset for each corpus (from manual tagging of the corpus) and condensing sets of tags which represent a grammatical distinction such as gender into single tags It can be argued that a smaller tagset should improve tagging accuracy, since it puts less of a burden on the tagger to make fine distinctions A smaller tagset may also mean that more words have only one possible tag and so can be handled trivially Conversely, more detail in the tagset may help the tagger when the properties of two adjacent words give support to the choice of tag for both of them; that is, the transitions between tags contribute the information the tagger needs Two experiments were conducted on three corpora: 300k words of Swedish text from the ECI Multilingual CD-ROM, and 100k words each of English and French from a corpus of International Telecommunications Union text The changes to the tagset are listed below G Gender: masculine, neuter, common gender UTR in the tagset  N Number: singular, plural Accuracy figures quoted here are for ambiguous and unknown words only, and therefore factor out effects due to the varying degree of ambiguity as the tagset changes The first experiment, with no unknown words, gave accuracies on ambiguous words of 91-93% for Swedish, 94-97% for French and 85-90% for English Summarising the patterns: Swedish Larger tagset generally gives higher accuracy English Larger tagset tends to give larger accuracy, though with less of a spread than for Swedish In the second experiment, the test corpora included unknown words, which had not been seen during training, and for which the tagger hypothesises all open-class tags Two results are interesting to look at here: the accuracy on the unknown words, and the accuracy on words which were ambiguous but were found in the training corpus The results, in outline, are: Swedish Similar results on known words to first experiment For unknown words, smaller tagsets give higher accuracy French For ambiguous words, the pattern and accuracy were similar to first experiment English Ambiguous words gave similar results to the first test Unknown words show a weak tendency to give higher accuracy on smaller tagsets Typical accuracies on ambiguous words were 90-92 93-97% and 83-88% for Swedish, French and English respectively, with the corresponding accuracies on unknown words being 25-50 45-52% and 44-58  Table lists the results, giving the tagset size, the degree of ambiguity and the accuracies on known ambiguous and unknown words
