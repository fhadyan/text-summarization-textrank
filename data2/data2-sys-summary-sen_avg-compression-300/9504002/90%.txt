 The most common pattern was for a larger tagset to give higher accuracy, but there were notable exceptions in French (where gender marking was the key factor in Swedish unknown words (which show the reverse trend) and in English unknown words (which show no very clear trend at all  The tagger used in the experiments took a very simple-minded approach to unknown words HMM taggers often perform poorly on unknown words A smaller tagset may also mean that more words have only one possible tag and so can be handled trivially The changes to the tagset are listed below G Gender: masculine, neuter, common gender UTR in the tagset  P Simplify pronoun classes Accuracy figures quoted here are for ambiguous and unknown words only, and therefore factor out effects due to the varying degree of ambiguity as the tagset changes The first experiment, with no unknown words, gave accuracies on ambiguous words of 91-93% for Swedish, 94-97% for French and 85-90% for English Summarising the patterns: Swedish Larger tagset generally gives higher accuracy English Larger tagset tends to give larger accuracy, though with less of a spread than for Swedish Two results are interesting to look at here: the accuracy on the unknown words, and the accuracy on words which were ambiguous but were found in the training corpus For unknown words, smaller tagsets give higher accuracy French For ambiguous words, the pattern and accuracy were similar to first experiment English Ambiguous words gave similar results to the first test Unknown words show a weak tendency to give higher accuracy on smaller tagsets Table lists the results, giving the tagset size, the degree of ambiguity and the accuracies on known ambiguous and unknown words
