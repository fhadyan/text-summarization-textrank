 The tagger used in the experiments took a very simple-minded approach to unknown words HMM taggers often perform poorly on unknown words Summarising the patterns: Swedish Larger tagset generally gives higher accuracy English Larger tagset tends to give larger accuracy, though with less of a spread than for Swedish Two results are interesting to look at here: the accuracy on the unknown words, and the accuracy on words which were ambiguous but were found in the training corpus For unknown words, smaller tagsets give higher accuracy French For ambiguous words, the pattern and accuracy were similar to first experiment English Ambiguous words gave similar results to the first test Unknown words show a weak tendency to give higher accuracy on smaller tagsets Table lists the results, giving the tagset size, the degree of ambiguity and the accuracies on known ambiguous and unknown words
