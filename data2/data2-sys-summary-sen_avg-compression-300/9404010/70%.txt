 The second line: says that the meaning of that f-structure is  More complicated lexical entries give not only meanings for f-structures, but also instructions for assembling f-structure meanings from the meanings of other f-structures We distinguish a meaning language, in which we represent the meanings of f-structures, and a composition language or glue language, in which we describe how to assemble the meanings of f-structures from the meanings of their substructures Each lexical entry will contain a composition language formula, its meaning constructor, specifying how a lexical entry contributes to the meaning of any structure in which it participates In principle, the meaning language can be any suitable logic Our composition language is a fragment of linear logic with higher-order quantification In contrast to standard approaches, which use the -calculus to combine fragments of meaning via ordered applications, we combine fragments of meaning through unordered conjunction and implication The formula states that the verb left requires a meaning X for its subject, ; when that meaning is provided, the meaning for the sentence will be  When the words Bill and left are used in a sentence, the metavariable will be instantiated to a particular f-structure, and the meaning given in the lexical entry will be used as the meaning of that f-structure From the instantiated lexical entries of Bill and left, we have the following semantic information: where leave and Bill are names for their respective formulas Once all the formulas are assembled, deduction in the logic is used to infer the meaning of the entire structure Throughout this process we maintain a clear distinction between meanings proper and assertions about meaning combinations For conciseness, we will not illustrate the combination of the meaning constructors for every and man; instead, we will work with the derived meaning constructor for the subject every man, showing how it combines with the meaning constructor for left to produce a meaning constructor giving the meaning of the whole sentence Under that assignment, a NP meaning Qhas type that is, a function from a property, the scope of quantification, to a proposition At the semantic composition level, we can understand that type as follows The f-structure for the sentence Every man left is: f: The meaning constructors for every man and left are: The meaning constructor for left is as before The meaning constructor for every man quantifies over semantic projections H which constitute possible quantification scopes; its propositional structure corresponds to the standard type assignment,  The meaning S will be instantiated to  From the premises in ( we can deduce the meaning of the scope f-structure f: The resource sensitivity of linear logic ensures that the scope of quantification is constructed and used exactly once We follow Montague (Montague:PTQ) in requiring intensional verbs like seek to take an object of NP type The lexical entry for seek can be paraphrased as follows: Rather than looking for an entity type meaning for its object, the requirement expressed by the subformula labeled exactly describes the form of quantified NP meanings discussed in the previous section In this case, a quantified NP in the object position is one that can accept anything that takes a meaning for to a meaning for any s, and convert that into a meaning for the s The f-structure for Bill seeks a unicorn is: f: The semantic information associated with this f-structure is: These are the premises for the deduction of the meaning of the sentence Bill seeks a unicorn The meaning constructor for seek also allows for nonquantified objects as arguments, without needing a special type-raising rule Here, we will appeal to a semantic projection , relating f-structures and their meanings Consider the f-structure for the sentence Bill seeks Al: f: The lexical entry for Al is analogous to the one for Bill We begin with the premises Bill-seeks and Al: For the derivation to proceed, Al must supply the NP meaning constructor that Bill-seeks requires This is possible because Al can map a proof of the meaning for s from the meaning for h into a meaning for s, simply by supplying to  Formally, from Al we can prove (Figure This corresponds to the Montagovian type-raising of a proper name meaning to an NP meaning, and also to the undirected Lambek calculus derivation of the sequent  Finally, as shown in the figure, the semantic projection of an f-structure f can be put in correspondence with a meaning : Informally, we read this expression as the meaning of f is
