 The second line: says that the meaning of that f-structure is  More complicated lexical entries give not only meanings for f-structures, but also instructions for assembling f-structure meanings from the meanings of other f-structures Each lexical entry will contain a composition language formula, its meaning constructor, specifying how a lexical entry contributes to the meaning of any structure in which it participates In principle, the meaning language can be any suitable logic In contrast to standard approaches, which use the -calculus to combine fragments of meaning via ordered applications, we combine fragments of meaning through unordered conjunction and implication The formula states that the verb left requires a meaning X for its subject, ; when that meaning is provided, the meaning for the sentence will be  When the words Bill and left are used in a sentence, the metavariable will be instantiated to a particular f-structure, and the meaning given in the lexical entry will be used as the meaning of that f-structure Once all the formulas are assembled, deduction in the logic is used to infer the meaning of the entire structure Throughout this process we maintain a clear distinction between meanings proper and assertions about meaning combinations For conciseness, we will not illustrate the combination of the meaning constructors for every and man; instead, we will work with the derived meaning constructor for the subject every man, showing how it combines with the meaning constructor for left to produce a meaning constructor giving the meaning of the whole sentence Under that assignment, a NP meaning Qhas type that is, a function from a property, the scope of quantification, to a proposition At the semantic composition level, we can understand that type as follows The f-structure for the sentence Every man left is: f: The meaning constructors for every man and left are: The meaning constructor for left is as before The meaning constructor for every man quantifies over semantic projections H which constitute possible quantification scopes; its propositional structure corresponds to the standard type assignment,  The meaning S will be instantiated to  In this case, a quantified NP in the object position is one that can accept anything that takes a meaning for to a meaning for any s, and convert that into a meaning for the s The f-structure for Bill seeks a unicorn is: f: The semantic information associated with this f-structure is: These are the premises for the deduction of the meaning of the sentence Bill seeks a unicorn The meaning constructor for seek also allows for nonquantified objects as arguments, without needing a special type-raising rule This is possible because Al can map a proof of the meaning for s from the meaning for h into a meaning for s, simply by supplying to  In particular, it allowed the derivation of from Bill-seeks Finally, as shown in the figure, the semantic projection of an f-structure f can be put in correspondence with a meaning : Informally, we read this expression as the meaning of f is
