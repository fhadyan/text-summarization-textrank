 The second line: says that the meaning of that f-structure is  Each lexical entry will contain a composition language formula, its meaning constructor, specifying how a lexical entry contributes to the meaning of any structure in which it participates In principle, the meaning language can be any suitable logic The formula states that the verb left requires a meaning X for its subject, ; when that meaning is provided, the meaning for the sentence will be  When the words Bill and left are used in a sentence, the metavariable will be instantiated to a particular f-structure, and the meaning given in the lexical entry will be used as the meaning of that f-structure For conciseness, we will not illustrate the combination of the meaning constructors for every and man; instead, we will work with the derived meaning constructor for the subject every man, showing how it combines with the meaning constructor for left to produce a meaning constructor giving the meaning of the whole sentence The f-structure for the sentence Every man left is: f: The meaning constructors for every man and left are: The meaning constructor for left is as before The meaning constructor for every man quantifies over semantic projections H which constitute possible quantification scopes; its propositional structure corresponds to the standard type assignment,  The meaning S will be instantiated to  The meaning constructor for seek also allows for nonquantified objects as arguments, without needing a special type-raising rule
