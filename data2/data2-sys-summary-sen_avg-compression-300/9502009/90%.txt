 The NLP tasks where SRs utility could be evaluated are diverse However, we have tested SRs on a WSS task, using the following scheme Previous knowledge used A semantic hierarchy (WordNet) where words are clustered in semantic classes, and semantic classes are organized hierarchically As evaluation measures we used coverage, abstraction ratio, and recall and precision ratios on the WSS task (section  In addition we performed some evaluation by hand comparing the SRs acquired by the different techniques Polysemous words are represented as instances of different classes The abstraction ratio for the different techniques is shown in table  In principle, the higher the precision and recall ratios the better the technique succeeds in inducing appropriate SRs for the disambiguation task The local normalizing technique using the uniform distribution does not help Output A set of syntactic SRs, (verb-lemma, syntactic-relationship, semantic-class, weight  The final SRs must be mutually disjoint In terms of WSS, general classes may be performing better than classes that fit the data better In this paper we have presented some variations affecting the association measure and thresholding on the basic technique for learning SRs from on-line corpora We proposed some evaluation measures for the SRs learning task SRs are weighted according to the statistical evidence found in the corpus Creation of the space of candidate classes Ribas reported experimental results obtained from the application of the above technique to learn SRs Most of the induced classes are due to incorrect senses The technique achieves a good coverage The different techniques are experimentally evaluated in section  Local weight could be obtained using p(c|n  Different association measures use the information provided in the cross-table to different extents Evaluation of the SR learning task would provide grounds to compare different techniques that try to abstract SRs from corpus using WordNet (eg, section  SRs are useful for both lexicography and NLP Hopefully, a technique with a higher abstraction ratio learns classes that fit the set of examples better
