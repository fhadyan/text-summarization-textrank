 Previous knowledge used A semantic hierarchy (WordNet) where words are clustered in semantic classes, and semantic classes are organized hierarchically In addition we performed some evaluation by hand comparing the SRs acquired by the different techniques Polysemous words are represented as instances of different classes The local normalizing technique using the uniform distribution does not help The final SRs must be mutually disjoint In terms of WSS, general classes may be performing better than classes that fit the data better We proposed some evaluation measures for the SRs learning task Ribas reported experimental results obtained from the application of the above technique to learn SRs Local weight could be obtained using p(c|n  Different association measures use the information provided in the cross-table to different extents Evaluation of the SR learning task would provide grounds to compare different techniques that try to abstract SRs from corpus using WordNet (e Hopefully, a technique with a higher abstraction ratio learns classes that fit the set of examples better
