 The default body describes how to continue processing with defaults in an adequate way Contrarily, for non-incremental input there will be no value given that can contradict default values In this framework, cancelling defaults requires the system to identify which results are caused by default handling VM-GEN is able to consume input increments of varying size The default body introduces a new value (sg) by creating an input increment as a default If, e This rule is represented in the grammar as a part of the description of subcategorization frames for verbs The advantage of this approach is, that processing is continued in a consistent way, which eases the introduction of the input-licensed value Evaluating the default body, the system creates a V-object OBJ e to model a flexible input interface der Besucher h dieser Termin wird von dem Besucher gewnscht  We provide the system with default descriptions The set of default preconditions expresses possible reasons for dead-end situations The default body is expressed in terms of the missing input specification in order to make the system work homogeneously In the underlying knowledge sources language-specific constraints are defined Generally speaking, default handling specifies how processing, ie further decision-making, can continue without sufficient input information So, one can compare default handling with advice to the system Even more homogeneity is introduced to an incremental system if the default descriptions are given in terms of input specifications This representation allows for easy checking the coincidence between a chosen default and input given later1 the application of a default (section 2 how default handling is integrated into a system (see section 2 how the knowledge for default handling is described (see section 2 In incremental generation, as mentioned in section 1, interleaved input consumption and output production causes specific default situations Thus, default handling should be triggered immediately Therefore, possible alternatives are either to wait for the next input or to trigger default handling Basically, there are two strategies to integrate default handling into ongoing processing Alternatively, the ongoing processing can deal with the default values in an ordinary manner (processing-conforming default handling  The knowledge source that is used for default handling should provide the most plausible actions for a default situation
