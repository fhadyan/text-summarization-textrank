 This section considers a restricted version of DATR without the default mechanism Note also that in the case of a global inheritance descriptor, the global context is effectively altered to reflect the new local context c  In fact, all of the information given explicitly in a DATR theory is strict Rather than interpreting node definitions (in a given global context) as partial functions from paths to values (i Now suppose that is the function associated with the node definition in a given DATR interpretation In a given global context c, a value descriptor d now corresponds to a total function (intuitively, a function from path extensions to values  For example, atoms now denote constant functions: More generally, value descriptors will denote different values for different paths The approach provides a transparent treatment of DATR's notion of (local and global) context and accounts for DATR's default mechanism by regarding value descriptors (semantically) as families of values indexed by paths First, it provides the DATR user with a concise, implementation-independent account of the meaning of DATR theories Section presents the syntax of the DATR language and introduces the notion of a DATR theory In principle, a DATR theory may consist of any combination of DATR sentences, either definitional or extensional, but in practice, DATR theories are more restricted than this In the remainder of this paper we will use the term (DATR) theory always in the sense functional, definitional (DATR) theory Each node is associated with a collection of definitional sentences that specify values associated with different paths Values given explicitly are specified either directly, by exhibiting a particular value, or indirectly, in terms of local and/or global inheritance Implicit specification is achieved via DATR 's default mechanism quoted) inheritance descriptors it is necessary to introduce DATR's notion of a global context More generally, the global context is used to fill in the missing node (path) when a global path (node) is encountered the path component of the global context is altered  the value associated with in the prevailing global context  DATR theories can be viewed semantically as collections of definitions of partial functions nodes' in DATR parlance) that map paths onto values
