 This section considers a restricted version of DATR without the default mechanism Section then shows how implicit information can be modelled by treating value descriptors as families of values indexed by paths Definition 41 A DATR interpretation is a triple , where 1 In particular, the formal apparatus introduced by Evans and Gazdar in provides no explicit model of DATR 's notion of global context The function can be thought of as mapping global contexts onto (partial) functions from local contexts to values We associate with the interpretation a partial denotation function and write to denote the meaning (value) of descriptor d in the global context c Rather, local and global inheritance are represented by distinct semantic functions and  Note also that in the case of a global inheritance descriptor, the global context is effectively altered to reflect the new local context c  Then, I models just in case the following containment holds for each node Nand context c: That is, an interpretation is a model of a DATR theory just in case (for each global context) the function it associates with each node respects the definition of that node within the theory This approach is possible only on the (overly restrictive) assumption that DATR statements involve either local or global inheritance relations, but never both default unification) for combining strict and default information In the case of DATR however, the formalism does not draw an explicit distinction between strict and default values for paths In fact, all of the information given explicitly in a DATR theory is strict The non-monotonic nature of DATR theories arises from a general, default mechanism which `fills in the gaps' by supplying values for paths not explicitly specified in a theory Thus, the default mechanism defines a class of implicit, definitional sentences with paths on the left that extend paths found on the left of explicit sentences Rather than interpreting node definitions (in a given global context) as partial functions from paths to values (i Now suppose that is the function associated with the node definition in a given DATR interpretation In a given global context c, a value descriptor d now corresponds to a total function (intuitively, a function from path extensions to values  For example, atoms now denote constant functions: More generally, value descriptors will denote different values for different paths An interpretation is a default model for theory just in case for every context cand node N we have: As an example, consider the default interpretation of the definition of the node given above We have presented a formal model of DATR as a language for defining partial functions and this model has been contrasted with an informal view of DATR as a language for representing inheritance hierarchies The approach provides a transparent treatment of DATR's notion of (local and global) context and accounts for DATR's default mechanism by regarding value descriptors (semantically) as families of values indexed by paths First, it provides the DATR user with a concise, implementation-independent account of the meaning of DATR theories Section presents the syntax of the DATR language and introduces the notion of a DATR theory An informal introduction to the DATR language is provided, by example, in section  The semantics of DATR is then covered in two stages Section introduces DATR interepretations and describes the semantics of a restricted version of the language without defaults The treatment of implicit information is covered in section , which provides a definition of a default model for a DATR theory The set DESC of DATR value descriptors (or simply descriptors) is built up from the atoms and nodes as shown below for any For any and : Value descriptors are either atoms or inheritance descriptors, where an inheritance descriptor is further distinguished as either local (unquoted) or global (quoted  There is just one kind of local descriptor (node/path but three kinds of global descriptor (node/path, path and node)  Intuitively, an extensional sentence states that the value associated with the path P at node N is  A definitional sentence specifies a property of the node N, namely that the path P is associated with the value defined by the sequence of value descriptors  A collection of equations can be used to specify the properties of different nodes in terms of one another, and a finite set of DATR sentences is called a DATR theory In principle, a DATR theory may consist of any combination of DATR sentences, either definitional or extensional, but in practice, DATR theories are more restricted than this In the remainder of this paper we will use the term (DATR) theory always in the sense functional, definitional (DATR) theory For a given DATR theory and node N of , we write to denote that subset of the sentences in that relate to the node N An example of (a fragment of) a DATR theory is shown in figure  Each node is associated with a collection of definitional sentences that specify values associated with different paths Values given explicitly are specified either directly, by exhibiting a particular value, or indirectly, in terms of local and/or global inheritance Implicit specification is achieved via DATR 's default mechanism On the other hand, the value of the empty path at is given indirectly, by local inheritance, as the value of the empty path at  quoted) inheritance descriptors it is necessary to introduce DATR's notion of a global context That is: Consequently, the required value is that associated with at the `global node' (i the node provided by the current global context which is just  More generally, the global context is used to fill in the missing node (path) when a global path (node) is encountered In addition however, the evaluation of a global descriptor results in the global context being set to the new node/path pair The definitions given there deal with a subset of DATR that includes core features of the language such as the notions of local and global inheritance and DATR's default mechanism the path component of the global context is altered  the value associated with in the prevailing global context  However, the semantic network metaphor is of far less value as a way of thinking about the DATR language itself What is more, the DATR language includes constructs that cannot be visualized in terms of simple networks of nodes connected by (local) inheritance links DATR theories can be viewed semantically as collections of definitions of partial functions nodes' in DATR parlance) that map paths onto values A model of a DATR theory is then an assignment of functions to node symbols that is consistent with the definitions of those nodes within the theory
