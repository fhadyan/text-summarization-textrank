 With respect to auxiliaries, the standard raising approach that is usually adopted yields undesirable structural complexity and results in idiosyncratic, language particular analyses of the role of auxiliaries In this paper, we concentrate on two issues within the broader perspective of PARGRAM: the treatment of auxiliaries and the transparent representation of multiple genitive NPs in German With respect to auxiliaries, the standard raising approach that is usually adopted yields undesirable structural complexity and results in idiosyncratic, language particular analyses of the role of auxiliaries Language particular idiosyncratic requirements are thus separated out from the language universal information required for further semantic interpretation, or machine translation Two fundamental levels of representations within LFG are the c(onstitutent structure and the f(unctional structure The c-structure encodes idiosyncratic phrase structural properties of a given language, while the f-structure provides a language universal representation of grammatical functions (e (1993  (1982 are they simply main verbs with special properties, or should they instantiate a special category AUX?
