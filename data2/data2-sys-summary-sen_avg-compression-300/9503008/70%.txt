 Unlike previous analyses, which postulate ambiguity of interpretation or derivation in the full clause source of the ellipsis, our analysis requires no such hidden ambiguity The antecedent or source clause is complete, whereas the target clause is missing (or contains only vestiges of) material found overtly in the source Furthermore, there are syntactic constraints that apply differentially to different ellipsis constructions * John greeted every person that Bill did so ? John greeted every person that Bill did too Of course, not all elements in the target clause must be analyzed as parallel to some element in the source No empty adverbial modifier need be posited in the source clause; the instrumental modifies the target sentence directly We have proposed codifying the ellipsis interpretation problem using expressions equating terms that represent phrase meanings The sentence is interpreted as meaning that Dan and George both like golf The entire formula then requires only that George possess some property, any property, that Dan possesses, which would give an incorrect interpretation for the target sentence The source clause, `Dan likes golf parallels the target `George does too with the subjects `Dan' and `George' being parallel elements, and the VP of the target sentence being vestigially represented by the target phrase `does too  Given this abstract view of ellipsis, the problem of ellipsis interpretation is just to recover a property of (or relation over) the parallel element (respectively, elements) in the target that the missing or vestigial material stands proxy for An ellipsis equation is not merely a recipe for a syntactic process The ellipsis equation reflects semantic facts about the sentence, but just at the gross level of function-argument structure There is one remaining problem, however, for this view of ellipsis equations the issue of primary occurrences We know that the application of the property or relation to the parallel elements in the source constitutes the interpretation of the source clause Before characterizing the interaction between our analysis of ellipsis and various other semantic phenomena, we must first lay out an approach to semantic interpretation quantifier scoping in particular in which to couch the discussion Specifically, the interpretation of John greeted every person The resulting interpretation is that is, a sentence meaning free of undischarged assumptions In general, then, the abstract problem of ellipsis can be stated as the problem of recovering solutions to the equation where s1 through sn are the interpretations of the parallel elements of the source, and s is the interpretation of the source itself This relative clause meaning serves as a function over the nominal meaning  Multiple property extraction: In some cases, a single sentence serves as the antecedent for two subsequent instances of ellipsis involving different parallel elements: John finished reading the poem before Bill did, and the short story too This sentence has a reading on which John finished reading both the poem and the short story before Bill finished reading the poem Cascaded ellipsis: Analyses differ as to what readings are predicted for sentences containing multiple elliptical clauses in which the interpretation of one elided constituent depends partially or entirely on the interpretation of another elided constituent Interaction with quantifier scoping: As is well known, the ambiguities following from varying quantifier scope possibilities interact with ellipsis resolution possibilities For instance, in the sentence John greeted every person when Bill did two readings are possible, depending on whether the universal quantifier has wide scope over both the main and subordinate clause, or quantifies separately in each clause But in John greeted every person that Bill did only a wide scope reading is available There are many instances in which the interpretation of elided phrases does not correspond to the interpretation of a syntactic constituent in the source clause But VP ellipsis provides examples as well For instance, there are cases in which a deeply embedded constituent induces a sloppy reading; in other cases, relations are formed with multiple parallel elements in the source and target clause; in still other cases, as discussed in Section below, the parallelism between the elements in the source and target clause is not syntactic, but semantically or pragmatically induced They are particularly problematic for identity-of-relations analyses in which the interpretation provided by the source clause corresponds to the translation of a syntactic constituent in the source An analysis postulating ambiguity of pronoun interpretation for only this restricted set of cases seems methodologically more plausible It is important that ellipsis analyses (including the equational one outlined above) allow for ambiguity in the target clause, that is, for a set of relations to be made available by the source clause The person who introduced Mary to John would not give her his phone number, nor would the person who introduced Sue to Bill The person who introduced Mary to John would not give Mary John's phone number, and the person who introduced Sue to Bill would not give Sue Bill's phone number The availability of multiple relations is attested in various phenomena in which the target clause has multiple readings; it can be seen most clearly in the distinction between strict and sloppy readings The parallel elements in the construction are, respectively, `the person who introduced Mary to John' and `the person who introduced Sue to Bill `Mary' and `Sue `John' and `Bill  Thus, the appropriate equation to solve is The sloppy reading is engendered by the following unifying substitution for P: which, when applied to the interpretations of the parallel elements in the target, yields the target interpretation Note that the recovered relation ( ) is not a relation corresponding to a conventional interpretation for the VP or any other constituent in the source clause On an identity-of-relations analysis, such relations would be available only by virtue of their use in the derivation of the source clause interpretation This would necessitate the postulation of wild ambiguity in the source clause, one derivation for each possible case of subsequent ellipsis There exist many cases of multiple parallel elements in the source and target clause; it is very common for ellipsis to involve relations formed by abstraction of elements other than the interpretation of the subject noun phrase For example, the tense and aspect of the target clause might differ from that in the source clause: Dan is running for president, and George did last term In the sentence Dan likes his wife, and George does too The consequence of this for theories where the relation available for interpretation of subsequent ellipsis must be available in the source sentence is, again, that every sentence which can be the antecedent for subsequent ellipsis must be many ways ambiguous; an interpretation must be available for each relation that might be needed to interpret ellipsis in subsequent discourse A single interpretation for the source clause can give rise to any required interpretation for the target, since there is no inherent restriction as to the number or nature of the parallel elements involved in the ellipsis197 A difficulty in any identity-of-relations analysis, which makes available only one interpretation for subsequent clauses exhibiting ellipsis, is seen when a single sentence is the antecedent for the ellipsis of two different noun phrases Consider the following: John finished reading the poem before Bill did, and the short story too This sentence has a reading on which John finished reading both the poem and the short story before Bill finished reading the poem On this reading, the source for both elliptical clauses is the same clause, `John finished reading the poem To produce a relation which can be the interpretation for the elided VP whose subject is Bill, the interpretation for the sentence `John finished reading the poem' must be derived as: so as to make available the property  On the desired reading, the interpretation for `John finished reading the poem' must be derived as: Under an identity-of-relations analysis, the source clause is deemed ambiguous between the two derivations In lambda notation, these two properties are given by and corresponding to the strict and sloppy readings of the sentence, respectively We use the term cascaded ellipsis to refer to cases of multiple ellipsis in which one of the elided constituents depends on another elided constituent for its interpretation Analyses dependent on an identity-of-relations approach generally make available fewer readings in cascaded ellipsis cases than the analysis presented here; we believe that the greater number of readings available with our analysis is in fact warranted Dahl claims that this sentence has, among other readings, the following one: John realizes that John is a fool but Bill does not realize that Bill is a fool, even though Bill's wife realizes that Bill is a fool discusses this example; his claim is that this reading is not available for this sentence On our analysis, this reading is readily available Assume that the interpretation for `John realizes that he is a fool' on the reading under discussion is: This sentence serves as the antecedent for the elided phrase in the second conjunct, `Bill does not  `Bill' and `John' are parallel elements; for the reading under discussion, second-order matching solves the equation producing, among others, the following property (corresponding to the sloppy option which is applied to `Bill  The parallel elements are `Bill' and `his wife the ellipsis equation is On the reading under discussion, the strict option is chosen; the property Q applied to the interpretation of `his wife' is: The resulting interpretation for the third conjunct is: Although we have described the derivation of the meaning for this example in terms of temporal ordering (we resolve the first ellipsis, using its result to resolve the second it is important to note that the analysis is truly order-free Sag obtains strict and sloppy readings under ellipsis by optionally applying a rule that replaces the interpretation of a pronoun (which has an invariant referent and induces a strict reading) by a lambda-bound variable (inducing a sloppy reading  Most previous analyses of ellipsis have allowed for the possibility of multiple available properties by arranging for the source clause to be ambiguous as to what property it makes available John greeted every person when Bill did John greeted every person that Bill did We will take the source of the ellipsis in ( ) to be the clause `John greeted every person and the target to be `Bill did  The source clause is interpreted under a quantifier assumption generated by the subject NP That is, in an individual instance, the source clause is interpreted in one of several possible ways, leading to the use of a particular property in the interpretation; the property used in the target clause is identical to the corresponding property in the source clause Consequently, the interpretation of the full sentence is where P is constrained equationally by virtue of the interpretation of the source clause: This equation has a single (most general) solution It is this value for P that we will apply to bill Thus, the interpretation of the full sentence, with ellipsis resolved is The assumption may now be discharged, yielding the full interpretation This interpretation corresponds to a necessarily distributive reading, the `individual' reading, in which each person is simultaneously greeted by John and Bill Under this scenario, the interpretation of the source clause is The full sentence, then, is interpreted as where, again, the interpretation of the source clause is used to constrain the property P: The single value for Pis leading to the final interpretation This interpretation yields a `group' reading paraphrasable as `John greeted every person when Bill greeted every person The two derivations, then, correspond to just the interpretations noted by Sag We take the source clause to be the entire sentence, and the target to be, again, `Bill did  The interpretation of the sentence before resolution of ellipsis and discharge of assumptions is (Again, Section records a derivation for a similar clause As before, we will resolve the ellipsis by finding solutions for the equation whose solution assigns P the relation  In sum, the ellipsis characterization described here allows for antecedent-contained ellipsis, and predicts correctly the interactions with quantifier scope Another implication of the account of quantifier scope given above is that in cases where the source clause exhibits quantifier scoping ambiguities, if the quantifiers are separately quantified in the two clauses (i For instance, in the sentence John gave every student a test, and Bill did too Consider the possible orderings of ellipsis resolution and discharging of quantifier assumptions But in that case, the ellipsis equation will include the quantifier order manifest in the source clause interpretation, and this will be carried over to the target interpretation In general, the semantic types of parallel elements must be identical As an example, we consider the sentence Every student revised his paper, and then Bill did This sentence is ambiguous, depending on whether Bill revises his own paper or each student's paper If the quantifier is discharged first, we have the meaning given in 1 for the first clause Under an identity-of-relations analysis, ambiguity of interpretation in a target clause comes about because the source clause is ambiguous To resolve the ellipsis, we need to set up an equation involving the interpretation of the parallel element in the source, every student  This interpretation only makes sense as part of the derivation of the meaning of the whole source clause To resolve the ellipsis, then, we set up the equation in 1 involving the meaning ( ) of the parallel element in the source, every student This equation has the solution The type of the noun phrase meaning is  The meaning for Bill must be type-raised to for type consistency However, only a single relation is available from the source clause in any given instance The value for P, when applied to the type-raised meaning for Bill yields the target meaning according to which Bill revises his own paper On the other hand, if ellipsis resolution occurs first, the derivation yields just before resolution The equation admits of a strict interpretation for P: The meaning for the conjoined sentence before ellipsis resolution reduces, after ellipsis resolution, to which, following discharging of the quantifier assumption, becomes On this reading, Bill revises each student's paper after the student revises it This sentence, for example, has three readings: John lost a book he owned, and so did Bill On the first reading, John and Bill lost the same book; on the second reading, John and Bill each lost one of John's books, possibly distinct; and on the third reading Bill lost one of his own books This sentence has three readings: Bill wants to read a good book and John does too Where the first conjunct has a de dicto reading, the second conjunct does also; where the first conjunct has a de re reading, however, there are two readings for the sentence as a whole, depending on whether or not Bill and John want to read the same book Examples such as these illustrate that the subject of the source clause need not take widest scope in VP ellipsis We follow Gawron and Peters in directing attention to the reading of the first conjunct where `John' and `his' corefer, and of the second elliptical clause where its source is the entire previous sentence #150 \t\t \t\t John and then the teacher revised John's paper; Bill and then the teacher revised Bill's paper #150 \t\t \t\t John and Bill both revised John's paper before the teacher revised the teacher's paper #150 \t\t \t\t John and Bill revised their own papers before the teacher revised John's paper #150 \t\t \t\t John and then the teacher revised John's paper; Bill revised John's paper before the teacher revised Bill's paper The strictest version of an identity-of-relations analysis requires that a lambda term used in the derivation of the meaning of the source clause be used in the derivation of the target clause meaning (either by copying or deletion under identity  Under such an analysis, the pertinent level of semantic representation of the source clause to use in the target clause derivation is that before beta reduction has occurred, as beta reduction eliminates the function-typed lambda terms Purely interpretive analyses , allow for multiple semantic interpretations arising from an unambiguous syntactic analysis of the source clause For the sentence `John revised his paper the unreduced meaning representation is one of: or corresponding to the strict and sloppy readings, respectively In forming the meaning of the first target clause `before the teacher did we use whichever term P is made available by the first clause, generating P(teacher  An issue remains as to how the two clause meanings are then combined to form a single sentence meaning The most natural method, direct coordination, would yield (for the sloppy reading corresponding to a syntactic analysis under which the adverbial clause is attached at the S level However, this is not itself of the form appropriate for being the source of a later ellipsis, that is, a function applied to the subject meaning Thus, under this analysis, the second ellipsis, `and Bill did too would be uninterpretable (Recall that we are ignoring the readings in which the source for the second ellipsis is merely `John revised his paper  Such a reading would be possible, although it would be strict or sloppy dependent on the interpretation of the other two clauses The second ellipsis is not, of course, uninterpretable, so we attempt to design a meaning representation for its source that is of the appropriate form Partially interpretive analyses involve either copying the syntactic tree from the source clause to the target but requiring identical semantic interpretations for the two VPs , or deleting the phrase structure of the second tree under the constraint of identical interpretation  Nonetheless, if this were the meaning representation of the source of the second ellipsis, it would allow for a sloppy reading of the target; this would correspond to the sloppy reading (  The strict variant would yield reading (  An alternative method of subordinating the `before' clause meaning maintains the alphabetic variance property of the two clauses The representation for the source of the second ellipsis might be extrapolated along different lines This would correspond to a syntactic analysis under which the adverbial clause is adjoined to the main clause verb phrase, with one verb phrase meaning appearing as a subconstituent of the other It also allows for a third reading when used as the source for the second elliptical clause This analysis, which generates three readings for the example sentence, is essentially the analysis developed by Gawron and Peters within a situation-theoretic framework Our analysis produces six readings for the example sentence Let us examine in detail how one of the readings for this sentence, ( ) above, is obtained under the equational analysis of ellipsis Assume that the semantics for `John revised his paper' is: The first conjoined sentence then will have the meaning under the constraint The second elliptical clause takes its source to be the whole first conjunction One solution is to take the strict reading for P, leading to the following interpretation for the second equation: This equation, in turn, has a solution The semantics for this reading of the sentence as a whole is: Our analysis allows for readings that are missing under the analyses discussed above because it is not an identity-of-relations analysis; interpretation of ellipsis does not involve copying the interpretation of a constituent in the source In Kamp's analysis, as in our own, ambiguities between strict and sloppy readings do not arise from ambiguity in the source clause; the source has only a single interpretation All of the analyses, however, share a reliance on semantic ambiguity in the source clause If a sloppy interpretation constraint applies to one copied discourse entity, it must apply to all; similarly for a strict interpretation constraint Insofar as Kamp's analysis can be fleshed out, his analysis and ours make the same predictions as to the class of readings available in cases of cascaded ellipsis Readings missing under other analyses are available for our analysis and his Rather, the pertinent distinction in differentiating the first four readings from the last two is that the resolution of the second elliptical construction in the last two readings must treat the parallel structures that ellipsis applies to in a non-parallel fashion This reading is parallel to reading ( ) described above We eschew not only syntactic ambiguity in the source clause, but semantic ambiguity arising from any source, as a generator of the multiple readings of elliptical constructions The following issues are problematic for most analyses of ellipsis interpretation Our analysis of ellipsis resolution presupposes identification of the source of the ellipsis and the parallel structuring of the source and target Cases of semantic or pragmatic parallelism also exist These cases are particularly problematic for theories of ellipsis in which the interpretation of an elided phrase is presumed to correspond to the interpretation of some syntactic constituent in the source clause, as is the case in most identity-of-relations analyses Examples of ellipsis exist in which the parallelism is between the logical subject (i Examples of this type are ubiquitous, but seem to be confined pragmatically to cases where the source clause states a general fact or rule, and the target clause provides a specific instance of this fact or rule Examples of passive/active parallelism are not confined to those in which the source and target appear in the main clause In the following example (due to parallelism of the heads of the main clause subjects forces a parallelism of arguments of the modifying relative clauses; John, the object of the relative clause in the source sentence, is parallel to Bill, the subject of the relative clause in the target sentence: The policeman who arrested John failed to read him his rights, and so, for that matter, did the one Bill got collared by Our analysis does not require that the property provided as the interpretation for the elided portion of the target clause in examples like those above correspond to the interpretation of any constituent in the source clause Syntactically, the parallel elements are the object of the source clause and the subject of the target; thematically, these elements are the theme arguments of the intransitive/causative get verb pair As described earlier, the problem of extracting a relation from the source clause can be stated equationally as In cases of VP ellipsis where the subjects of the source and target are parallel, the equation is simply P(s1) = s where s1 is the interpretation of the subject of the source clause To the extent that this sentence is grammatical, it illustrates that either the source or target clause can contain a logical subject which is parallel to a surface subject in the other clause Although examples such as these are often restricted in their distribution, they demonstrate that the parallelism between elements in the source and target clause need not be confined to surface syntactic parallelism Identity-of-relations analyses allow for only the simplest cases of resolution of elided constituents, since the only mechanism that is available to provide an interpretation for the target is that of copying an interpretation from the source Cases in which sloppy but not strict readings are available might seem to be problematic for an analysis like the one presented here However, there are other cases in which readings are unexpectedly unavailable; these cases generally involve multiple occurrences of pronouns whose antecedent is a parallel element in the source clause In general, only sloppy readings are available for sentences involving control The following sentence is not ambiguous: John tried to run, and Bill did too First, anaphors whose antecedent is the subject of a controlled VP can give rise to both a sloppy and a strict reading under ellipsis Consider this sentence: John tried to kill himself before Bill did On the property analysis, the interpretation for the first conjunct would then be: However, we find this sentence to have two readings, corresponding to the following paraphrases: [a John tried to kill himself before Bill tried to kill himself [b John tried to kill himself before Bill tried to kill John The second of these readings would not be obtainable given ( ) as the source clause meaning demonstrates another problem for Chierchia's property analysis Recall that `Dan' and `George' are the parallel elements in this example, and the semantic interpretation of `Dan likes golf' is We have underlined what we will call primary occurrences of the parallel element's interpretation, for reasons to be clarified later Thus, in ( the interpretation would be which, when taken to be a source for ellipsis, would generate only two solutions to the equation manifesting a sloppy reading for the controlled subject occurrence and either a strict or a sloppy reading for the reflexive occurrence, as required characterize reflexive constructions involving only sloppy readings as closed predicate constructions In cases where there are two pronouns coreferent with the parallel element in the source, one might expect that each pronoun would give rise to either a strict or a sloppy reading, giving a total of four readings for the target clause notes that the following sentence, with two occurrences of pronouns in the source clause, has only three and not four interpretations: [a Bill believed that he loved his wife, and Harry did too To form an interpretation for the second conjunct, we require a property P that, when applied to the interpretation of the subject of the first conjunct, will yield the interpretation of the first conjunct as a whole The interpretation paraphrased in 0b is missing This property will serve to generate the interpretation of the target clause #150 \t\t \t\t John and then the teacher revised John's paper; Bill revised John's paper before the teacher revised Bill's paper On the excluded reading, the source clause is John revised his paper before the teacher did and the target clause is Bill did too  John and Bill are the parallel elements It will be applied to the interpretation of the parallel element, that of the subject `George in the second clause John likes Mary, and shei likes Maryi too We can state this requirement directly with the following equation, an instance of the more general equation ( The latter term is the interpretation for the source sentence; the equation requires P to be a property that, when predicated of the subject interpretation dan, yields the first term on the reading in which Mary revises John's paper and Bill revises his own paper The analysis we present is intended to characterize the semantics of constructions involving ellipsis This constraint requiring abstraction of primary occurrences comes about because the parallel element in the target clause must play the primary role in the meaning of the target We can now use this function as the interpretation of the elided VP in (1 with P(george) as the interpretation of the target clause, this gives the following semantics for the sentence as a whole: In summary, our analysis of the abstract problem of ellipsis resolution, that is, generating appropriate properties to be used in interpreting the target clause, is to state the problem equationally based on the parallel structure in the two clauses and to solve the equation using higher-order unification (under the constraint requiring abstraction of primary occurrences  The properties that are generated as solutions to the equation are predicated of the parallel elements in the target clause to generate the target clause interpretation As seen in the preceding example, the equation stating an ellipsis interpretation problem may have several alternative solutions, which the higher-order unification algorithm will generate Either of the other two remaining properties yields a possible interpretation of the target clause The first gives rise to what has been called the strict reading of the second conjunct, while the second gives rise to the sloppy reading: (George likes Dan's wife (George likes George's wife As illustrated in the foregoing examples, we use the distinction between primary and secondary occurrences of a term to constrain the acceptable solutions of an ellipsis interpretation equation We can provide an abstract and reasonably theory-neutral characterization of ellipsis phenomena and their interpretation as follows One of the distinguishing features of our analysis is that the ellipsis resolution problem is separated into two subtasks: a prior determination of the parallel structure of source and target, and consequent formation of the implicit relation to be used in the target
