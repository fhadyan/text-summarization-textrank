 Unlike previous analyses, which postulate ambiguity of interpretation or derivation in the full clause source of the ellipsis, our analysis requires no such hidden ambiguity The antecedent or source clause is complete, whereas the target clause is missing (or contains only vestiges of) material found overtly in the source * John greeted every person that Bill did so ? John greeted every person that Bill did too Of course, not all elements in the target clause must be analyzed as parallel to some element in the source No empty adverbial modifier need be posited in the source clause; the instrumental modifies the target sentence directly We have proposed codifying the ellipsis interpretation problem using expressions equating terms that represent phrase meanings The sentence is interpreted as meaning that Dan and George both like golf The entire formula then requires only that George possess some property, any property, that Dan possesses, which would give an incorrect interpretation for the target sentence The source clause, `Dan likes golf parallels the target `George does too with the subjects `Dan' and `George' being parallel elements, and the VP of the target sentence being vestigially represented by the target phrase `does too  Given this abstract view of ellipsis, the problem of ellipsis interpretation is just to recover a property of (or relation over) the parallel element (respectively, elements) in the target that the missing or vestigial material stands proxy for We know that the application of the property or relation to the parallel elements in the source constitutes the interpretation of the source clause Specifically, the interpretation of John greeted every person The resulting interpretation is that is, a sentence meaning free of undischarged assumptions This relative clause meaning serves as a function over the nominal meaning  Multiple property extraction: In some cases, a single sentence serves as the antecedent for two subsequent instances of ellipsis involving different parallel elements: John finished reading the poem before Bill did, and the short story too This sentence has a reading on which John finished reading both the poem and the short story before Bill finished reading the poem Cascaded ellipsis: Analyses differ as to what readings are predicted for sentences containing multiple elliptical clauses in which the interpretation of one elided constituent depends partially or entirely on the interpretation of another elided constituent For instance, in the sentence John greeted every person when Bill did two readings are possible, depending on whether the universal quantifier has wide scope over both the main and subordinate clause, or quantifies separately in each clause But in John greeted every person that Bill did only a wide scope reading is available There are many instances in which the interpretation of elided phrases does not correspond to the interpretation of a syntactic constituent in the source clause But VP ellipsis provides examples as well For instance, there are cases in which a deeply embedded constituent induces a sloppy reading; in other cases, relations are formed with multiple parallel elements in the source and target clause; in still other cases, as discussed in Section below, the parallelism between the elements in the source and target clause is not syntactic, but semantically or pragmatically induced They are particularly problematic for identity-of-relations analyses in which the interpretation provided by the source clause corresponds to the translation of a syntactic constituent in the source It is important that ellipsis analyses (including the equational one outlined above) allow for ambiguity in the target clause, that is, for a set of relations to be made available by the source clause On an identity-of-relations analysis, such relations would be available only by virtue of their use in the derivation of the source clause interpretation This would necessitate the postulation of wild ambiguity in the source clause, one derivation for each possible case of subsequent ellipsis There exist many cases of multiple parallel elements in the source and target clause; it is very common for ellipsis to involve relations formed by abstraction of elements other than the interpretation of the subject noun phrase For example, the tense and aspect of the target clause might differ from that in the source clause: Dan is running for president, and George did last term The consequence of this for theories where the relation available for interpretation of subsequent ellipsis must be available in the source sentence is, again, that every sentence which can be the antecedent for subsequent ellipsis must be many ways ambiguous; an interpretation must be available for each relation that might be needed to interpret ellipsis in subsequent discourse A single interpretation for the source clause can give rise to any required interpretation for the target, since there is no inherent restriction as to the number or nature of the parallel elements involved in the ellipsis197 A difficulty in any identity-of-relations analysis, which makes available only one interpretation for subsequent clauses exhibiting ellipsis, is seen when a single sentence is the antecedent for the ellipsis of two different noun phrases Consider the following: John finished reading the poem before Bill did, and the short story too This sentence has a reading on which John finished reading both the poem and the short story before Bill finished reading the poem On this reading, the source for both elliptical clauses is the same clause, `John finished reading the poem To produce a relation which can be the interpretation for the elided VP whose subject is Bill, the interpretation for the sentence `John finished reading the poem' must be derived as: so as to make available the property  On the desired reading, the interpretation for `John finished reading the poem' must be derived as: Under an identity-of-relations analysis, the source clause is deemed ambiguous between the two derivations We use the term cascaded ellipsis to refer to cases of multiple ellipsis in which one of the elided constituents depends on another elided constituent for its interpretation On our analysis, this reading is readily available `Bill' and `John' are parallel elements; for the reading under discussion, second-order matching solves the equation producing, among others, the following property (corresponding to the sloppy option which is applied to `Bill  Sag obtains strict and sloppy readings under ellipsis by optionally applying a rule that replaces the interpretation of a pronoun (which has an invariant referent and induces a strict reading) by a lambda-bound variable (inducing a sloppy reading  Most previous analyses of ellipsis have allowed for the possibility of multiple available properties by arranging for the source clause to be ambiguous as to what property it makes available John greeted every person when Bill did John greeted every person that Bill did We will take the source of the ellipsis in ( ) to be the clause `John greeted every person and the target to be `Bill did  The source clause is interpreted under a quantifier assumption generated by the subject NP That is, in an individual instance, the source clause is interpreted in one of several possible ways, leading to the use of a particular property in the interpretation; the property used in the target clause is identical to the corresponding property in the source clause Thus, the interpretation of the full sentence, with ellipsis resolved is The assumption may now be discharged, yielding the full interpretation This interpretation corresponds to a necessarily distributive reading, the `individual' reading, in which each person is simultaneously greeted by John and Bill Under this scenario, the interpretation of the source clause is The full sentence, then, is interpreted as where, again, the interpretation of the source clause is used to constrain the property P: The single value for Pis leading to the final interpretation This interpretation yields a `group' reading paraphrasable as `John greeted every person when Bill greeted every person The two derivations, then, correspond to just the interpretations noted by Sag We take the source clause to be the entire sentence, and the target to be, again, `Bill did  The interpretation of the sentence before resolution of ellipsis and discharge of assumptions is (Again, Section records a derivation for a similar clause As before, we will resolve the ellipsis by finding solutions for the equation whose solution assigns P the relation  For instance, in the sentence John gave every student a test, and Bill did too Consider the possible orderings of ellipsis resolution and discharging of quantifier assumptions But in that case, the ellipsis equation will include the quantifier order manifest in the source clause interpretation, and this will be carried over to the target interpretation As an example, we consider the sentence Every student revised his paper, and then Bill did If the quantifier is discharged first, we have the meaning given in 1 for the first clause Under an identity-of-relations analysis, ambiguity of interpretation in a target clause comes about because the source clause is ambiguous To resolve the ellipsis, we need to set up an equation involving the interpretation of the parallel element in the source, every student  This interpretation only makes sense as part of the derivation of the meaning of the whole source clause The meaning for Bill must be type-raised to for type consistency However, only a single relation is available from the source clause in any given instance The value for P, when applied to the type-raised meaning for Bill yields the target meaning according to which Bill revises his own paper The equation admits of a strict interpretation for P: The meaning for the conjoined sentence before ellipsis resolution reduces, after ellipsis resolution, to which, following discharging of the quantifier assumption, becomes On this reading, Bill revises each student's paper after the student revises it This sentence, for example, has three readings: John lost a book he owned, and so did Bill On the first reading, John and Bill lost the same book; on the second reading, John and Bill each lost one of John's books, possibly distinct; and on the third reading Bill lost one of his own books This sentence has three readings: Bill wants to read a good book and John does too Examples such as these illustrate that the subject of the source clause need not take widest scope in VP ellipsis We follow Gawron and Peters in directing attention to the reading of the first conjunct where `John' and `his' corefer, and of the second elliptical clause where its source is the entire previous sentence #150 \t\t \t\t John and then the teacher revised John's paper; Bill and then the teacher revised Bill's paper #150 \t\t \t\t John and Bill both revised John's paper before the teacher revised the teacher's paper #150 \t\t \t\t John and then the teacher revised John's paper; Bill revised John's paper before the teacher revised Bill's paper The strictest version of an identity-of-relations analysis requires that a lambda term used in the derivation of the meaning of the source clause be used in the derivation of the target clause meaning (either by copying or deletion under identity  Under such an analysis, the pertinent level of semantic representation of the source clause to use in the target clause derivation is that before beta reduction has occurred, as beta reduction eliminates the function-typed lambda terms Purely interpretive analyses , allow for multiple semantic interpretations arising from an unambiguous syntactic analysis of the source clause For the sentence `John revised his paper the unreduced meaning representation is one of: or corresponding to the strict and sloppy readings, respectively In forming the meaning of the first target clause `before the teacher did we use whichever term P is made available by the first clause, generating P(teacher  An issue remains as to how the two clause meanings are then combined to form a single sentence meaning Thus, under this analysis, the second ellipsis, `and Bill did too would be uninterpretable (Recall that we are ignoring the readings in which the source for the second ellipsis is merely `John revised his paper  Such a reading would be possible, although it would be strict or sloppy dependent on the interpretation of the other two clauses The second ellipsis is not, of course, uninterpretable, so we attempt to design a meaning representation for its source that is of the appropriate form Partially interpretive analyses involve either copying the syntactic tree from the source clause to the target but requiring identical semantic interpretations for the two VPs , or deleting the phrase structure of the second tree under the constraint of identical interpretation  Nonetheless, if this were the meaning representation of the source of the second ellipsis, it would allow for a sloppy reading of the target; this would correspond to the sloppy reading (  The strict variant would yield reading (  An alternative method of subordinating the `before' clause meaning maintains the alphabetic variance property of the two clauses The representation for the source of the second ellipsis might be extrapolated along different lines This would correspond to a syntactic analysis under which the adverbial clause is adjoined to the main clause verb phrase, with one verb phrase meaning appearing as a subconstituent of the other It also allows for a third reading when used as the source for the second elliptical clause Our analysis produces six readings for the example sentence Assume that the semantics for `John revised his paper' is: The first conjoined sentence then will have the meaning under the constraint The second elliptical clause takes its source to be the whole first conjunction One solution is to take the strict reading for P, leading to the following interpretation for the second equation: This equation, in turn, has a solution The semantics for this reading of the sentence as a whole is: Our analysis allows for readings that are missing under the analyses discussed above because it is not an identity-of-relations analysis; interpretation of ellipsis does not involve copying the interpretation of a constituent in the source In Kamp's analysis, as in our own, ambiguities between strict and sloppy readings do not arise from ambiguity in the source clause; the source has only a single interpretation All of the analyses, however, share a reliance on semantic ambiguity in the source clause If a sloppy interpretation constraint applies to one copied discourse entity, it must apply to all; similarly for a strict interpretation constraint This reading is parallel to reading ( ) described above We eschew not only syntactic ambiguity in the source clause, but semantic ambiguity arising from any source, as a generator of the multiple readings of elliptical constructions The following issues are problematic for most analyses of ellipsis interpretation Our analysis of ellipsis resolution presupposes identification of the source of the ellipsis and the parallel structuring of the source and target Cases of semantic or pragmatic parallelism also exist These cases are particularly problematic for theories of ellipsis in which the interpretation of an elided phrase is presumed to correspond to the interpretation of some syntactic constituent in the source clause, as is the case in most identity-of-relations analyses Examples of passive/active parallelism are not confined to those in which the source and target appear in the main clause In the following example (due to parallelism of the heads of the main clause subjects forces a parallelism of arguments of the modifying relative clauses; John, the object of the relative clause in the source sentence, is parallel to Bill, the subject of the relative clause in the target sentence: The policeman who arrested John failed to read him his rights, and so, for that matter, did the one Bill got collared by Our analysis does not require that the property provided as the interpretation for the elided portion of the target clause in examples like those above correspond to the interpretation of any constituent in the source clause As described earlier, the problem of extracting a relation from the source clause can be stated equationally as In cases of VP ellipsis where the subjects of the source and target are parallel, the equation is simply P(s1) = s where s1 is the interpretation of the subject of the source clause To the extent that this sentence is grammatical, it illustrates that either the source or target clause can contain a logical subject which is parallel to a surface subject in the other clause However, there are other cases in which readings are unexpectedly unavailable; these cases generally involve multiple occurrences of pronouns whose antecedent is a parallel element in the source clause The following sentence is not ambiguous: John tried to run, and Bill did too Consider this sentence: John tried to kill himself before Bill did On the property analysis, the interpretation for the first conjunct would then be: However, we find this sentence to have two readings, corresponding to the following paraphrases: [a John tried to kill himself before Bill tried to kill himself [b John tried to kill himself before Bill tried to kill John The second of these readings would not be obtainable given ( ) as the source clause meaning demonstrates another problem for Chierchia's property analysis Thus, in ( the interpretation would be which, when taken to be a source for ellipsis, would generate only two solutions to the equation manifesting a sloppy reading for the controlled subject occurrence and either a strict or a sloppy reading for the reflexive occurrence, as required In cases where there are two pronouns coreferent with the parallel element in the source, one might expect that each pronoun would give rise to either a strict or a sloppy reading, giving a total of four readings for the target clause This property will serve to generate the interpretation of the target clause #150 \t\t \t\t John and then the teacher revised John's paper; Bill revised John's paper before the teacher revised Bill's paper On the excluded reading, the source clause is John revised his paper before the teacher did and the target clause is Bill did too  John and Bill are the parallel elements It will be applied to the interpretation of the parallel element, that of the subject `George in the second clause We can state this requirement directly with the following equation, an instance of the more general equation ( The latter term is the interpretation for the source sentence; the equation requires P to be a property that, when predicated of the subject interpretation dan, yields the first term on the reading in which Mary revises John's paper and Bill revises his own paper This constraint requiring abstraction of primary occurrences comes about because the parallel element in the target clause must play the primary role in the meaning of the target The properties that are generated as solutions to the equation are predicated of the parallel elements in the target clause to generate the target clause interpretation As seen in the preceding example, the equation stating an ellipsis interpretation problem may have several alternative solutions, which the higher-order unification algorithm will generate Either of the other two remaining properties yields a possible interpretation of the target clause
