 Unlike previous analyses, which postulate ambiguity of interpretation or derivation in the full clause source of the ellipsis, our analysis requires no such hidden ambiguity We know that the application of the property or relation to the parallel elements in the source constitutes the interpretation of the source clause Specifically, the interpretation of John greeted every person This would necessitate the postulation of wild ambiguity in the source clause, one derivation for each possible case of subsequent ellipsis On the desired reading, the interpretation for `John finished reading the poem' must be derived as: Under an identity-of-relations analysis, the source clause is deemed ambiguous between the two derivations John greeted every person when Bill did John greeted every person that Bill did The source clause is interpreted under a quantifier assumption generated by the subject NP But in that case, the ellipsis equation will include the quantifier order manifest in the source clause interpretation, and this will be carried over to the target interpretation Under an identity-of-relations analysis, ambiguity of interpretation in a target clause comes about because the source clause is ambiguous Our analysis produces six readings for the example sentence The following issues are problematic for most analyses of ellipsis interpretation Our analysis of ellipsis resolution presupposes identification of the source of the ellipsis and the parallel structuring of the source and target The second of these readings would not be obtainable given ( ) as the source clause meaning This property will serve to generate the interpretation of the target clause On the excluded reading, the source clause is John revised his paper before the teacher did and the target clause is Bill did too  John and Bill are the parallel elements The properties that are generated as solutions to the equation are predicated of the parallel elements in the target clause to generate the target clause interpretation Either of the other two remaining properties yields a possible interpretation of the target clause
