 Note that this leads to `recall' percentages above 100% in case more collocations are extracted than with BI5 Another possibility had to be discarded, viz to take all collocations that are mentioned in a collocation dictionary as the maximal number of valid collocations: a comparison with Agricola (1970) or Drosdowski (1970) is not really possible because the collocations found in the corpus are not a subset of those mentioned in the dictionaries If non-significant combinations are omitted with a t-test (BI5/t Inf the average number of extracted collocations is minimally lower, and precision rises slightly For bringen, the approximate absolute number of collocations in the MK1 was manually determined Out of 585 different V-N combinations, 71 can generously be classified as collocations7% (precision 67 For collocations that are based on a verb and a noun (usually an object argument, sometimes this can also be the subject of an intransitive verb three types of V-N collocations are distinguished for German in the literature: verbal phrasemes (idioms) (e V-N combinations that occurred less than two times with a single inflection form of the verb were sorted out The average results are again presented in table (BI2 Lemma the number of extracted collocations is maximal, but precision is the lowest of all Precision ranges from 883% (gehen recall from 166 If collocations for the infinitive and past participle only are extracted (BI2 Inf+Part recall is as good as with BI5 Inf, with an improved precision of 78 Regarding lemmatization our study shows that one gets more collocations, but at the expense of more uninteresting combinations as well 1992) support verb constructions (SVCs) (v nPolenz 1989 or Danlos 1992) collocations in the narrower sense (Hausmann 1989) The differences between these three types are gradual and it is hard to find criteria of good selectivity to distinguish collocations from phrasemes V-N combinations within 2 words to the left of the infinitive were also calculated for a larger corpus consisting of the MK1 and BZK together (6 The number of V-N collocations found with BI2 Inf is almost twice as big (186% `recall with a slightly lower precision than for the small corpus So, larger corpora considerably improve recall Considering that the corpus is untagged, this is quite a good result for the automatic acquisition of collocations Precision would rise to 85% on average if one could consider syntactic relations for the extraction of V-N collocations BI2 Inf, no subj' in table  Larger corpora improve recall without a serious decline in precision, though some additional noise seems to come along with the bigger amount of data (BI2 Inf Mk+Bz 8% precision, `BI2 Inf Mk+Bz,MI,f 5  This will give indications to distinguish SVCs and lexicalized, phraseological SVCs from other collocations Collocations are well suited for statistical corpus studies (1991 for the (semi automatic extraction of verb-noun (V-N) collocations from untagged German text corpora Language use turns such word combinations into phrase-like stereotypes Choueka (1988) describes how to automatically extract adjacent word combinations from English corpora as a preselection of collocation candidates to ease a lexicographer's search for collocations7 million words newspaper corpus In German, common nouns and proper names start with an uppercase letter (sentence beginnings are changed to lowercase in the corpus) which makes it possible to extract V-N collocations even from untagged corpora if the verb is used as the key word The results give good indications how promising the retrieval of collocations is with POS-tagged corpora We use verbs that can occur in SVCs as key words because they provide examples for all three types of V-N collocations; besides, the chosen potential support verbs anyway belong to the most frequent verbs in the corpus Collocations in the sense of `frequently cooccurring words' can quite easily be extracted from corpora by statistic means 1983  From these lists, candidates for V-N collocations were automatically extracted, sorted by MI Some properties of the German language make the task of extracting V-N collocations from German text corpora more difficult than for English significant collocations Most nouns within 5 words to the right of a verb are not its object or prepositional object and therefore are not potential collocation partners Furthermore, except for the experiment simulating lemmatization, we only extract collocations for verbs in the infinitive form Casual word combinations show a normal, free syntagmatic behaviour Following Smadja (1991a we define precision as the number of correctly found collocations divided by the number of V-N combinations found at all Recall reflects the ratio of the number of correctly found collocations and the maximal number of collocations that could possibly have been found The latter is difficult to determine, because the total number of collocations occurring in the whole corpus needs to be known Thus, we decided to use instead the number of collocations as determined by the standard method (BI5) as the basis for recall comparisons, i 100% `recall' is set to this number
