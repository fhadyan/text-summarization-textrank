 Note that this leads to `recall' percentages above 100% in case more collocations are extracted than with BI5 Another possibility had to be discarded, viz to take all collocations that are mentioned in a collocation dictionary as the maximal number of valid collocations: a comparison with Agricola (1970) or Drosdowski (1970) is not really possible because the collocations found in the corpus are not a subset of those mentioned in the dictionaries Only 22 of the 43 collocations found with the lemma bring- in the MK1 (BI5) belong to the 135 combinations mentioned in the lexical entry for bringen in Agricola (1970  The number of V-N combinations occurring at least 3 times varies from 46 (bringen) to 6 (erfahren, gelangen, geraten, treten precision from 100% (geraten, ziehen) to 33% (erfahren  If non-significant combinations are omitted with a t-test (BI5/t Inf the average number of extracted collocations is minimally lower, and precision rises slightly For bringen, the approximate absolute number of collocations in the MK1 was manually determined Out of 585 different V-N combinations, 71 can generously be classified as collocations7% (precision 67 So we reduced window-size to 2 words to the left of the verb which allows one word in between, e As shown in table for BI2 Inf, precision rises about 15 but with a recall of 72 For collocations that are based on a verb and a noun (usually an object argument, sometimes this can also be the subject of an intransitive verb three types of V-N collocations are distinguished for German in the literature: verbal phrasemes (idioms) (e V-N combinations that occurred less than two times with a single inflection form of the verb were sorted out The average results are again presented in table (BI2 Lemma the number of extracted collocations is maximal, but precision is the lowest of all Precision ranges from 883% (gehen recall from 166 If collocations for the infinitive and past participle only are extracted (BI2 Inf+Part recall is as good as with BI5 Inf, with an improved precision of 78 Regarding lemmatization our study shows that one gets more collocations, but at the expense of more uninteresting combinations as well 1992) support verb constructions (SVCs) (v nPolenz 1989 or Danlos 1992) collocations in the narrower sense (Hausmann 1989) The differences between these three types are gradual and it is hard to find criteria of good selectivity to distinguish collocations from phrasemes V-N combinations within 2 words to the left of the infinitive were also calculated for a larger corpus consisting of the MK1 and BZK together (6 The number of V-N collocations found with BI2 Inf is almost twice as big (186% `recall with a slightly lower precision than for the small corpus So, larger corpora considerably improve recall If both are combined, less than 3 out of 100 combinations are wrongly extracted, of course with a low recall of less than half of the unfiltered BI2 Inf Considering that the corpus is untagged, this is quite a good result for the automatic acquisition of collocations In order to see how much the precision could possibly be improved by determining syntactic relations as done by Smadja (1991a,b) for English, we conducted another test where we manually excluded from BI2 Inf those wrongly extracted combinations in which the nouns were in fact used in subject position of the verb Precision would rise to 85% on average if one could consider syntactic relations for the extraction of V-N collocations BI2 Inf, no subj' in table  Results with parsed data should thus be better The task of extracting V-N collocations can be split into two sub-tasks: (i) the extraction of possible candidates (ii) the filtering of undesired combinations For (i a general basic requirement is a POS-tagged corpus, unless verbs or adjectives are given as key words and combinations with nouns are to be extracted Larger corpora improve recall without a serious decline in precision, though some additional noise seems to come along with the bigger amount of data (BI2 Inf Mk+Bz 8% precision, `BI2 Inf Mk+Bz,MI,f 5  This will give indications to distinguish SVCs and lexicalized, phraseological SVCs from other collocations Collocations are well suited for statistical corpus studies (1991 for the (semi automatic extraction of verb-noun (V-N) collocations from untagged German text corpora Language use turns such word combinations into phrase-like stereotypes Choueka (1988) describes how to automatically extract adjacent word combinations from English corpora as a preselection of collocation candidates to ease a lexicographer's search for collocations Grefenstette (1992) has developed Sextant, a system that can (among other things) produce bigrams for verb and subject, direct or indirect object combinations, adjective-noun and noun-noun combinations for English and French7 million words newspaper corpus In German, common nouns and proper names start with an uppercase letter (sentence beginnings are changed to lowercase in the corpus) which makes it possible to extract V-N collocations even from untagged corpora if the verb is used as the key word The results give good indications how promising the retrieval of collocations is with POS-tagged corpora We use verbs that can occur in SVCs as key words because they provide examples for all three types of V-N collocations; besides, the chosen potential support verbs anyway belong to the most frequent verbs in the corpus Collocations in the sense of `frequently cooccurring words' can quite easily be extracted from corpora by statistic means A span of 5 words to the left and right is said to capture 95% of significant collocations in English (Martin et al From these lists, candidates for V-N collocations were automatically extracted, sorted by MI Some properties of the German language make the task of extracting V-N collocations from German text corpora more difficult than for English A minor difference concerns the strong inflection of German verbs Whereas in English a verb lexeme appears in 3 or 4 different forms plus one for the present participle, German verbs have 7 to 10 verb forms (without subjunctive forms) for one lexeme and additional 4 for the present participle significant collocations Most nouns within 5 words to the right of a verb are not its object or prepositional object and therefore are not potential collocation partners As a conclusion, with an unparsed corpus we restrict our search to V-N combinations where the noun precedes the verb within two to five words, because this is most likely to capture complements of main verbs in verb-final position Furthermore, except for the experiment simulating lemmatization, we only extract collocations for verbs in the infinitive form Casual word combinations show a normal, free syntagmatic behaviour The infinitive form is used as nonfinite verb in complex tenses (modal, conditional, future) and is identical in form with 1st/3rd pers Following Smadja (1991a we define precision as the number of correctly found collocations divided by the number of V-N combinations found at all Recall reflects the ratio of the number of correctly found collocations and the maximal number of collocations that could possibly have been found The latter is difficult to determine, because the total number of collocations occurring in the whole corpus needs to be known Thus, we decided to use instead the number of collocations as determined by the standard method (BI5) as the basis for recall comparisons, i 100% `recall' is set to this number
