 Note that this leads to `recall' percentages above 100% in case more collocations are extracted than with BI5 If non-significant combinations are omitted with a t-test (BI5/t Inf the average number of extracted collocations is minimally lower, and precision rises slightly For bringen, the approximate absolute number of collocations in the MK1 was manually determined Out of 585 different V-N combinations, 71 can generously be classified as collocations7% (precision 67 For collocations that are based on a verb and a noun (usually an object argument, sometimes this can also be the subject of an intransitive verb three types of V-N collocations are distinguished for German in the literature: verbal phrasemes (idioms) (e The average results are again presented in table (BI2 Lemma the number of extracted collocations is maximal, but precision is the lowest of all Precision ranges from 883% (gehen recall from 166 If collocations for the infinitive and past participle only are extracted (BI2 Inf+Part recall is as good as with BI5 Inf, with an improved precision of 78 The number of V-N collocations found with BI2 Inf is almost twice as big (186% `recall with a slightly lower precision than for the small corpus So, larger corpora considerably improve recall Precision would rise to 85% on average if one could consider syntactic relations for the extraction of V-N collocations BI2 Inf, no subj' in table 8% precision, `BI2 Inf Mk+Bz,MI,f 5  Collocations are well suited for statistical corpus studies (1991 for the (semi automatic extraction of verb-noun (V-N) collocations from untagged German text corpora Language use turns such word combinations into phrase-like stereotypes Choueka (1988) describes how to automatically extract adjacent word combinations from English corpora as a preselection of collocation candidates to ease a lexicographer's search for collocations7 million words newspaper corpus The results give good indications how promising the retrieval of collocations is with POS-tagged corpora Collocations in the sense of `frequently cooccurring words' can quite easily be extracted from corpora by statistic means 1983  From these lists, candidates for V-N collocations were automatically extracted, sorted by MI significant collocations Casual word combinations show a normal, free syntagmatic behaviour Following Smadja (1991a we define precision as the number of correctly found collocations divided by the number of V-N combinations found at all Recall reflects the ratio of the number of correctly found collocations and the maximal number of collocations that could possibly have been found
