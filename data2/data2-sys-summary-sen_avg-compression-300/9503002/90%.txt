 Knowing the dialect areas helps one allocate resources in language research and has implications for language learners, publishers, broadcasters, educators, and language planners Here one seeks to divide the sites into two groups by finding the two representative sites (the medoids) around which all the other sites cluster in such a way as to give the least average distance between the sites and their representatives One way of measuring how well a binary clustering technique works for dialect grouping is to compare for each site i its average dissimilarity from the other sites in the same dialect, a(i with its average dissimilarity from the sites in the other dialect, b(i  This analysis produces a large dialect which groups together the sites in Munster, Scotland, the Isle of Man, and almost all sites in Connacht, as well as Rathlin Island in Ulster; and another which groups together all the other sites in Ulster, as well as County Cavan in Connacht25, with the sites outside of Munster and Southern Connacht being indifferently classified Both group into one loosely-connected entity all the sites in Scotland, and into another all the sites in Ireland Except for Rathlin Island, both methods group the Irish sites into one group containing all the sites in Ulster, and another, Southern, group, which itself breaks into a group containing all the sites in Connacht and one containing all the sites in Munster As for clustering the sites into dialect areas, the familiar bottom-up agglomeration method proves superior to top-down partitioning around medoids The two linguistically closest sites are grouped into one dialect, and thenceforth treated as a unit The first deals with distance matrices Wagner administered a questionnaire to native speakers of Irish Gaelic in 86 sites Wagner also presents material from the Isle of Man and seven sites in Scotland For example, for the concept `sell I identified two sets, one using the word dol (most sites in Ireland and one using the word creic (Rathlin Island, the Isle of Man, and Scotland  Distance between sites was determined by counting 0 whenever two sites were in the same set and 1 whenever two sites were in contrasting sets, then taking the mean This computed the Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings
