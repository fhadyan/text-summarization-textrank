 Knowing the dialect areas helps one allocate resources in language research and has implications for language learners, publishers, broadcasters, educators, and language planners crodh mentioned above There is some variation in how the distance between two clusters is measured Here one seeks to divide the sites into two groups by finding the two representative sites (the medoids) around which all the other sites cluster in such a way as to give the least average distance between the sites and their representatives The process was repeated recursively on each dialect One way of measuring how well a binary clustering technique works for dialect grouping is to compare for each site i its average dissimilarity from the other sites in the same dialect, a(i with its average dissimilarity from the sites in the other dialect, b(i  So the isogloss is incomplete and cannot be meaningfully compared with isoglosses based on different sets of sites Averaging this statistic across all sites gives an idea of how felicitous the overall clustering is,  Figures - present the silhouette for clustering the isogloss distance matrix by partitioning This analysis produces a large dialect which groups together the sites in Munster, Scotland, the Isle of Man, and almost all sites in Connacht, as well as Rathlin Island in Ulster; and another which groups together all the other sites in Ulster, as well as County Cavan in Connacht25, with the sites outside of Munster and Southern Connacht being indifferently classified Since agglomeration is the better clustering technique, the best dialect analysis should be obtained by agglomerating the isogloss matrix Both group into one loosely-connected entity all the sites in Scotland, and into another all the sites in Ireland Except for Rathlin Island, both methods group the Irish sites into one group containing all the sites in Ulster, and another, Southern, group, which itself breaks into a group containing all the sites in Connacht and one containing all the sites in Munster Both methods agree on how the 87 sites are distributed among these dialects This three-way division accords with the universal perception that Ulster, Connacht and Munster form the three major dialect groups This experiment shows that an automatic procedure can reliably group a language into its dialect areas, starting from nothing more than phonetic transcriptions as commonly found in linguistic surveys As for clustering the sites into dialect areas, the familiar bottom-up agglomeration method proves superior to top-down partitioning around medoids Of course simply knowing the dialect areas is not the last word in dialectology They replace isoglosses with a distance matrix, which compares each site directly with all other sites, ultimately yielding a single figure that measures the linguistic distances between each pair of sites Sguy's earliest work (1971) was based on lexical correspondences: sites differed in the extent to which they used different words for the same concept Not all dialectometrists agree on the wisdom of delineating dialect areas The two linguistically closest sites are grouped into one dialect, and thenceforth treated as a unit The process continues recursively until all sites are grouped into one superdialect embracing the entire language area under consideration Comparing all possible pairs of sites is a O(N[2 problem, whereas considering all possible two-way partitions of the dialect area is O(2[N  The first deals with distance matrices At one time the Gaelic language group was spoken throughout Ireland, from where it spread to the Isle of Man and to much of Scotland Wagner administered a questionnaire to native speakers of Irish Gaelic in 86 sites Wagner also presents material from the Isle of Man and seven sites in Scotland At best, isoglosses for different features approach each other, forming vague bundles; at worst, isoglosses may cut across each other, describing completely contradictory binary divisions of the dialect area For example, for the concept `sell I identified two sets, one using the word dol (most sites in Ireland and one using the word creic (Rathlin Island, the Isle of Man, and Scotland  Distance between sites was determined by counting 0 whenever two sites were in the same set and 1 whenever two sites were in contrasting sets, then taking the mean This baseline approach corresponds formally to determining distance by the number of isoglosses that separate sites, which is in principle the traditional technique Another set of approaches for computing distance was based on the phonetics This computed the Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings The simplest technique used was phone string comparison These distances were used instead of uniform 1-unit costs in computing Levenshtein distance
