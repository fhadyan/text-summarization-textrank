 Grice's maxims [Grice 1975] are framed as directives to the speaker, and so it is natural to consider how they might impact on the task of natural language generation ( NLG  If we are in a context, for example, where referent identification is obviously the task, and the expression contains information unnecessary for identification, the hearer must consider the possibility that this information has been provided by the speaker for some other purpose but note that it might not be; it might have been put in to help with identification even if it turns out that the hearer did not make use of it for that purpose The task of generating referring expressions and in particular, anaphoric referring expressions provides an arena where we can move towards a more formal specification of what this really involves Given some internal symbol that corresponds to an intended referent, the job of a referring expression generator is to determine the semantic content of a noun phrase that will identify the intended referent to the hearer In Dale [1989 one of us characterised the task of determining the content of a referring expression as being constrained by three Grice-like principles: the PRINCIPLE OF SENSITIVITY, which states that the referring expression chosen should take account of the state of the hearer's knowledge; the PRINCIPLE OF ADEQUACY, which states that the referring expression chosen should be sufficient to identify the intended referent; and the PRINCIPLE OF EFFICIENCY, which states that the referring expression chosen should provide no more information than is necessary for the identification of the intended referent Suggestions that referring expression generation should be governed by principles like those just described are common, but detailed algorithms that meet the specified goals are somewhat rarer A number of the maxims can collectively be expressed by the imperative Don't say too much and don't say too little This focusses our attention on the language generation subtask of CONTENT DETERMINATION; and one of the more constrained and well-explored aspects of content determination is the generation of referring expressions Choose Property: determine which property of the intended referent would rule out the largest number of other entities in the context In the context of referring expression generation, typical goals could include: Getting the hearer to identify the intended referent r This information could be expressed in a separate clause, but could equally well be folded into the same referring expression that is being used for the referent identification in the first goal (Appelt [1982] provides a very nice example of this  In addition to goal orientation, aspects of genre such as register and sublanguage also play an important role in determining appropriate referring expressions In particular, whether a specific referring expression is interpreted by the hearer as being purely for identification or not may depend on the current genre For example, in casual conversation, a hearer might interpret Give me the Staedtler pen as having some purpose beyond simple identification (perhaps informing the hearer that the speaker prefers pens made by Staedtler since manufacturer is not a commonly used attribute in identification-only referring expressions in this genre Consequently, an NLG system that is generating an identification-only referring expression should if possible use only those attributes that are typically used for identification in the target genre; otherwise, false implicatures may arise Our experience suggests that, at least for the task of generating referring expressions, the second interpretation is the best one It is possible, of course, that an algorithm might unintentionally include irrelevant information; this is also true of human linguistic behaviour We have argued that Grice's Maxims do not need to be explicitly enforced or modelled in a natural language generation system A generation system should be goal-driven, and conform to the current genre
