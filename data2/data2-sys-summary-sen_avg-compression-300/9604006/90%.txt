 Given some internal symbol that corresponds to an intended referent, the job of a referring expression generator is to determine the semantic content of a noun phrase that will identify the intended referent to the hearer In Dale [1989 one of us characterised the task of determining the content of a referring expression as being constrained by three Grice-like principles: the PRINCIPLE OF SENSITIVITY, which states that the referring expression chosen should take account of the state of the hearer's knowledge; the PRINCIPLE OF ADEQUACY, which states that the referring expression chosen should be sufficient to identify the intended referent; and the PRINCIPLE OF EFFICIENCY, which states that the referring expression chosen should provide no more information than is necessary for the identification of the intended referent Choose Property: determine which property of the intended referent would rule out the largest number of other entities in the context In the context of referring expression generation, typical goals could include: Getting the hearer to identify the intended referent r In particular, whether a specific referring expression is interpreted by the hearer as being purely for identification or not may depend on the current genre For example, in casual conversation, a hearer might interpret Give me the Staedtler pen as having some purpose beyond simple identification (perhaps informing the hearer that the speaker prefers pens made by Staedtler since manufacturer is not a commonly used attribute in identification-only referring expressions in this genre Consequently, an NLG system that is generating an identification-only referring expression should if possible use only those attributes that are typically used for identification in the target genre; otherwise, false implicatures may arise Avoid obscurity of expression Avoid ambiguity We have argued that Grice's Maxims do not need to be explicitly enforced or modelled in a natural language generation system A generation system should be goal-driven, and conform to the current genre
