 SPATTER consists of three main decision-tree models: a part-of-speech tagging model, a node-extension model, and a node-labeling model The parsing procedure is a search for the highest probability parse tree SPATTER's search procedure uses a two phase approach to identify the highest probability parse of a sentence Using these two search modes, SPATTER guarantees that it will find the highest probability parse7 words The first question a decision tree might ask is: 1 A node at which the decision tree stops asking questions is a leaf node A decision-tree model is not really very different from an interpolated n-gram model The number of parameters in this n-gram model is Using this definition, an n-gram model can be represented by a decision-tree model with n-1 questions A decision-tree model can be represented by an interpolated n-gram model as follows These probabilities are estimated using statistical decision tree models The probability of a complete parse tree (T) of a sentence (S) is the product of each decision (di) conditioned on all previous decisions: Each decision sequence constructs a unique parse, and the parser selects the parse whose decision sequence yields the highest cumulative probability
