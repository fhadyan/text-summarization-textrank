 In processing the sentence Mary introduced John to Susan, a word-by-word approach such as Milward (1992) provides the following logical forms after the corresponding sentence fragments are absorbed: Mary introduced John to Suex intr(mary,john,Mary \t\t Pintr(mary,x,y) Mary introduced John \t\t y For example, Mary introduced something to something is inappropriate if the final sentence is Mary introduced noone to anybody Parse a new word, Wordi 2 Consider trying to perform threading in left-to-right order during interpretation of the sentence, John left if Mary left Now consider processing if Mary left Finally, it argued that the apparently close relationship between the states used in incremental semantics and dynamic semantics fails to hold below the sentence level, and briefly presented a more indirect way of using dynamic semantics in incremental interpretation lambda expressions) word by word Traditional layered models of sentence processing first build a full syntax tree for a sentence, and then extract a semantic representation from this Incremental interpretation allows on-line semantic filtering, i Consider the sentence fragment, Mary thinks John John could also be embedded within a sentence which has a sentence modifier requiring its own s node e However, on-line semantic filtering for sentence processing does have drawbacks Resnik 1992  1983  Semantic representations could be formed word by word by extracting `default' syntax trees (by strengthening dominance links into immediated dominance links wherever possible
