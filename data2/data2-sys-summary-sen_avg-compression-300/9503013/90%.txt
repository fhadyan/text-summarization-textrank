 The third possibility is suggested by considering the semantic representations which are appropriate during a word by word parse This is essentially the approach taken in Milward (1992) in order to provide complete, word by word, incremental interpretation using simple lexicalised grammars, such as a lexicalised version of formal dependency grammar and simple categorial grammar In processing the sentence Mary introduced John to Susan, a word-by-word approach such as Milward (1992) provides the following logical forms after the corresponding sentence fragments are absorbed: Mary introduced John to Suex intr(mary,john,Mary \t\t PP(mary) Mary introduced \t\t xintr(mary,x,y) Mary introduced John \t\t yintr(mary,john,y) Mary introduced John to \t\t y For example, Mary introduced something to something is inappropriate if the final sentence is Mary introduced noone to anybody Parse a new word, Wordi 2 the universal quantifier is within the scope of the existential) whereas in sentence (b) the preferred reading is where the universal quantifier has scope over the existential Scope preferences sometimes seem to be established before the end of a sentence grammar, is for an inner scope reading for the first quantifier In an incremental semantics, we would expect the information state of an interpreter to be updated word by word Consider trying to perform threading in left-to-right order during interpretation of the sentence, John left if Mary left Now consider processing if Mary left In the present implementation, semantic structures (akin to logical forms) are built word by word, and each structure is then evaluated independently using a dynamic semantics (with threading performed according to the structure of the logical form  The paper described some potential applications of incremental interpretation Finally, it argued that the apparently close relationship between the states used in incremental semantics and dynamic semantics fails to hold below the sentence level, and briefly presented a more indirect way of using dynamic semantics in incremental interpretation lambda expressions) word by word Traditional layered models of sentence processing first build a full syntax tree for a sentence, and then extract a semantic representation from this Incremental interpretation allows on-line semantic filtering, i Both Categorial approaches to incremental interpretation and approaches which use partial syntax trees get into difficulty in cases of left recursion Consider the sentence fragment, Mary thinks John A possible partial syntax tree is provided by Fig John could also be embedded within a sentence which has a sentence modifier requiring its own s node e However, on-line semantic filtering for sentence processing does have drawbacks Resnik 1992  To enable complete, fully word by word parsing requires a way of encoding an infinite number of partial trees Semantic representations could be formed word by word by extracting `default' syntax trees (by strengthening dominance links into immediated dominance links wherever possible
