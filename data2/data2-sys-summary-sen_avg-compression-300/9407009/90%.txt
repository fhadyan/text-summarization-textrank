 Most spoken language translation systems rely on a pipelined architecture, including speech recognition, linguistic analysis, transfer, generation and speech synthesis218 = 0462 = 1 All of them were significant at the P=00005 level Speech recognition 577 utterances (839 were acceptably recognized6 received a QLF The ratio of error rates is 46 passed grammar specialization; 54 of the 75 relevant incorrectly recognized utterances did so (72 The ratio of error rates is 419, an even larger difference than for the entire set Most obviously, pipelined systems are clearly doing rather better than the naive model predicts The system is constructed from a set of general-purpose speech and language processing components The main components are the SRI DECIPHER(TM) system (speech recognition two copies of the SRI Core Language Engine (CLE) (source and target language processing and the Telia Research Prophon system (speech synthesis  We focussed our investigations on four conceptual functionalities in the system: speech recognition, source language analysis, grammar specialization, and transfer-and-generation Source language analysis Proportion of input utterance hypotheses that do not receive a semantic analysis Grammar specialization Proportion of input utterance hypotheses receiving an analysis with the normal grammar that receive no analysis with the specialized grammar8 passed grammar specialization Of the 653 examples with no upstream error, 539 (82 Recognition 1001 examples; 789 successes; error rate = 21 Linguistic analysis 1001 examples; 706 + 135 = 841 successes; error rate = 15 Grammar specialization 841 examples; 653 + 101 = 754 successes; error rate = 10
