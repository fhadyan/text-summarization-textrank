 These specialized terms may be the best (or only) way to describe their topic Those words that were considered to be possible SL terms by either author were looked up in the appropriate specialized dictionary Those few terms that might be true SL terms that were not included in the dictionary were considered not to be SL terms for the purposes of the data analysis described below The largest percent of terms found in the dictionary in one form or another was a tie between Electrical Engineering and Physics, each of which had 66 percent of their terms found in the specialized dictionary The smallest percent of terms found in a sublanguage dictionary was 17 percent for Sociology In most cases, more terms occurred at the start of a phrase in the dictionary than as an exact match for the single term in the dictionary One or more of these entry phrases may have been used in the text, or the word may have been used in a different phrase Table shows that the average term frequencies for those terms that are exact matches or occur at the start of the phrase are much higher than for terms not in the dictionary or are term variants of terms that occur in the dictionary For all domains except for Economics, the average term frequency for exact matches is higher than the average term frequency for terms not in the dictionary For all domains except for Mathematics, the average term frequency for terms occurring at the start of a phrase was higher than for terms not in the dictionary These term frequencies may be useful in separating terms likely to occur in a specialized dictionary from terms not likely to occur in a specialized dictionary, that is, the separation of SL terms from general terms Usage was examined from several perspectives, including term frequency and specialized and standard dictionary definitions of terms, to identify differences between disciplines and families of disciplines Terms were ranked for each database by their Poisson percentile Table lists the 5 top and bottom terms for each database after the terms were ranked by their Poisson percentile Sixty-two percent of the SL word tokens (technical terms) identified by an expert were not found in the dictionary Some are general `research description terms, such as discussed and method  It is interesting to note that although there is no overlap between disciplines in the top ranked terms, there is some in the bottom ranked terms Merely finding a word from a particular set of abstracts in the specialized dictionary for that discipline does not guarantee that the word is being used in the abstracts in its SL sense, as defined in the dictionary Many words that have a very specific meaning in a particular domain are also used with a different, more general meaning, in general language The lack of coverage of the SL terms is not surprising, given the wealth of terms used in various disciplines, the speed with which new terminology is adopted, and the propensity of authors to coin new terms The word token in the abstract used the same SL word sense as that defined in the special dictionary SG - Same sense, general The word token in the abstract used the same sense as that defined in the special dictionary, which was a general definition In general language, it is used in the same way The word token in the abstract is used in a different sense from that defined in the special dictionary, but it is still used as an SL term DG - Different sense, general The word token in the abstract is used in a different sense from that defined in the special dictionary, and its usage was in a general language sense Specialized dictionaries may be sought to expand the coverage of the standard dictionary In the Physics abstracts, it was used in the general sense of a span of time A dictionary written to describe words and concepts in a particular discipline may be expected to contain more of the SL terms, and more of the SL senses or meanings of terms, than a general dictionary Not only were terms mostly used in a general sense, it is these general senses that were defined in the specialized dictionaries9% of the term occurrences were used in a general sense8% of the humanities and social science term occurrences were used in a general sense, a smaller proportion than the top-ranked terms However, about half of these were used in a general sense different from that defined in the special dictionary Note that none of the terms in the humanities and social sciences were used in an SL sense different from that defined in the special dictionary Specialized dictionaries also indicate what the important terms and concepts in their disciplines are Most of the occurrences of the bottom-ranked words in the scientific disciplines were used in a different sense from that given in the dictionary Only one third of the humanities and social science terms' occurrences were used in a different sense In scientific disciplines such as Mathematics or Physics, the words that occur more frequently than expected (the top-ranked terms) are generally used in a specific, SL sense The infrequent words that could also be used in an SL sense are not used that way The shift in usage between the top and bottom ranked words seen here is that the top ranked words are primarily used in the same general sense as that defined in the specialized dictionary, while the bottom ranked words are used almost as frequently in a different general sense We propose a usage based measure, that may be interpreted as the percent of term uses (for terms in the dictionary) that are used in the text in a sublanguage sense, or the probability that a term is used in a sublanguage sense given that the term is present in the dictionary Mu values may be indicative of the degree to which terms in the sublanguage are differentiated from those in general language A small Mu indicates that technical terms, (those in the SL are frequently used in non-technical senses, while an Mu of 1 represents these terms being used only in a technical sense The ratio of the usage measure Mu for the top terms to that for the bottom terms provides a measure of the difference between these two areas: where represents the Mu value for the top ten terms, with similar notation used for the bottom ten terms Scientific disciplines may exhibit a greater degree of variation between the rate of terms most likely to be used in an SL sense for those terms that are expected to be most characteristic of the SL vs There was little difference in the number of terms with entries7% of the scientific disciplines' terms had entries, ranging from 94% (Biology) to 402% of the terms had entries, ranging from 100% of the Sociology terms to 52% of the History terms None of the Sociology and History terms were marked, and 42% of the economics terms were marked, yielding an average number of marked terms for the humanities and social sciences of 1 First, we looked at word frequencies, and especially at the frequencies of SL terms We may measure the general distinctiveness of an SL by noting the overlap between terms defined in an SL dictionary with those terms defined in a general dictionary It may be computed as where SL is the set of terms in the sublanguage dictionary, Gthe set of terms in the general dictionary, and where |x| is the number of items in set x In addition to comparing SLs with the general language, two SLs may be compared with one another As defined, they may measure the distinctiveness of those terms included in a specialized dictionary To the extent that a sublanguage may be defined as those specialized terms occurring in a discipline specific dictionary, these dictionary based measures may be used as measures of sublanguage distinctiveness A third possibility would be to combine dictionary definitions with meanings extracted from the context in which the terms are used in the abstracts The final question we investigated was whether term frequencies could be used to classify abstracts by discipline It may include words or phrases that are not used in general language, and may also use familiar words in unfamiliar ways These terms have an indeterminate and thus unusable Poisson percentile Word frequencies, the overlap of usage between related and unrelated domains, inclusion of SL terms in general and specialized dictionaries, and similar data are informative about the nature of the language used in different disciplines and the differences between the disciplines [  Vocabulary in abstracts from different disciplines varies considerably from discipline to discipline This measure can be based on either the terms of the SL or on the terms' definitions Usage refers to both the words that are used and the word senses that are used General: The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition Biology: Chambers Biology Dictionary Economics: Dictionary of Economics The list of SL terms used in a discipline may include words that are not used (or are used very infrequently) in general language, such as the Physics term dipole  Electrical Engineering: IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms, Third Edition SL terms may also include words that are familiar in general language, but are used in a special, very specific sense in the language of the domain Math: Mathematics Dictionary, Fifth Edition Physics: Dictionary of Physics, Third Edition Word and word sense usage in a particular discipline may also be borrowed from related domains The reader must expect that such terms are defined in the particular paper in which they are used General, or standard, college or unabridged dictionaries contain SL terms from many disciplines Definitions given in a general dictionary may not be as detailed or complete as those in a specialized dictionary The recency of a dictionary may have some effect on its coverage of SL terms Given the time lag inherent in publishing a printed dictionary, a dictionary published in 1990, for example, may not include important terms from abstracts published in the same year A systematic sample of 500 terms was taken from each database
