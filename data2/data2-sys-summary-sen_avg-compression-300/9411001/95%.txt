 These term frequencies may be useful in separating terms likely to occur in a specialized dictionary from terms not likely to occur in a specialized dictionary, that is, the separation of SL terms from general terms Usage was examined from several perspectives, including term frequency and specialized and standard dictionary definitions of terms, to identify differences between disciplines and families of disciplines Terms were ranked for each database by their Poisson percentile DG - Different sense, general A dictionary written to describe words and concepts in a particular discipline may be expected to contain more of the SL terms, and more of the SL senses or meanings of terms, than a general dictionary Not only were terms mostly used in a general sense, it is these general senses that were defined in the specialized dictionaries9% of the term occurrences were used in a general sense8% of the humanities and social science term occurrences were used in a general sense, a smaller proportion than the top-ranked terms Specialized dictionaries also indicate what the important terms and concepts in their disciplines are Only one third of the humanities and social science terms' occurrences were used in a different sense2% of the terms had entries, ranging from 100% of the Sociology terms to 52% of the History terms We may measure the general distinctiveness of an SL by noting the overlap between terms defined in an SL dictionary with those terms defined in a general dictionary It may be computed as where SL is the set of terms in the sublanguage dictionary, Gthe set of terms in the general dictionary, and where |x| is the number of items in set x As defined, they may measure the distinctiveness of those terms included in a specialized dictionary To the extent that a sublanguage may be defined as those specialized terms occurring in a discipline specific dictionary, these dictionary based measures may be used as measures of sublanguage distinctiveness Biology: Chambers Biology Dictionary The list of SL terms used in a discipline may include words that are not used (or are used very infrequently) in general language, such as the Physics term dipole  Electrical Engineering: IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms, Third Edition SL terms may also include words that are familiar in general language, but are used in a special, very specific sense in the language of the domain James Physics: Dictionary of Physics, Third Edition Sociology: Sociology General, or standard, college or unabridged dictionaries contain SL terms from many disciplines
