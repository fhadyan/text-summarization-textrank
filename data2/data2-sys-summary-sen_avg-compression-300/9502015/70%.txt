 provides an account of LFG semantics that represents the meaning of lexical items with linear logic formulas We now return to consider cases involving intensional verbs The preferred reading for sentence ( in which only one quantifier scopes over the two extensional predicates, is shown below: The f-structure for example ( ) is given in (  The meaning constructors for the lexical items are given in Figure  Recall that a second meaning constructor and2 is introduced by and in order to handle cases where there are more than two conjuncts; this contribution will be used once in the derivation of the meaning for sentence (  This requires that the quantified NP meaning be duplicated, since otherwise no readings result These formulas manipulate basic assertions of the form , for f-structures f and meaning logic terms M It also predicts the desired reading for sentence ( since that reading requires two quantifiers Finally, our account readily applies to cases of intensional verbs without coordination as in example ( since it applies more generally to cases of resource sharing The multiple use of semantic contributions results from viewing dependencies in f-structures as resources; in this way the one-to-one correspondence between f-structure relations and meanings is maintained Here is a mapping, the semantic projection, that relates f-structures to semantic structures To distinguish between multiple paths entering an f-structure, we now take to map from sets of paths in f-structures to semantic structures Further, the paths between f-structures are made available in the semantic space as resources This makes it possible for the semantic formulas to exploit information about the multiple paths into an f-structure in order to account for the multiple uses of the f-structure's semantic contribution We discuss examples involving intensional verbs in Section  Obviously, such cases fall outside of the purview of the coordination schema However, there are cases where a single constituent appears to yield more than one contribution to the meaning of an utterance Two extensional verbs such as find and support are coordinated at their basic types: find and support (type Two intensional verbs such as want and seek are also coordinated at their basic (higher) types: want and seek (type The argument to this expression is a quantified NP For instance, in ( two extensional verbs and an intensional verb are coordinated want, find, and support: Application of this expression to a quantifier results in two quantifiers being scoped separately over the extensional verbs This is the wrong result; in a sentence such as Hillary wanted, found, and supported two candidates, the desired result is where one quantifier scopes over both extensional verbs (that is, Hillary found and supported the same two candidates just as in the case where all the verbs are extensional However, the need to type-raise extends to cases not involving coordination, as in sentence (  In example ( for instance, NAFTA is the object of two different verbs: Bill supported, and Hillary opposed, NAFTA LFG assumes two syntactic levels of representation: constituent structure (c-structure) encodes phrasal dominance and precedence relations, and functional structure (f-structure) encodes syntactic predicate-argument structure The f-structure for sentence ( ) is given in ( Lexical entries specify syntactic constraints on f-structures as well as semantic information: Semantic information is expressed in (1) a meaning language and (2) a language for assembling meanings, or glue language Expressions of the meaning language (such as Bill) appear on the right side of the meaning relation  The semantic contribution of each lexical entry, which we will refer to as a meaning constructor, is a linear-logic formula consisting of instructions in the glue language for combining the meanings of the lexical entry's syntactic arguments to obtain the meaning of the f-structure headed by the entry , the relation associates expressions in the meaning language with f-structures As a result, each f-structure contributed a single meaning constructor as a resource to be used in a derivation Intuitively, however, the need for the multiple use of an f-structure meaning results not from the appearance of a particular lexical item (e We will identify an occurrence of an f-structure with a path (from the root) to that occurrence; sets of occurrences of an f-structure can therefore be identified with path sets in the f-structure Hence from a path set S, we can read off an f-structure Sf In the examples discussed in Dalrymple et al there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of path sets S and the set of f-structures Sf picked out by such path sets, so the two methods yield the same predictions for those cases Relations between path sets are represented explicitly as resources in the logic by R-relations That is, the f-structure Gf appears at the end of the singleton path P in the f-structure Ff For example, the f-structure given in ( ) results in two R-relations: Because f and g represent path sets entering an f-structure that they label, R-relation (i) indicates that the set of paths First we consider the derivation of the basic case of right-node raising (RNR) illustrated in sentence ( repeated in (  We refine our previous analysis to account for cases where an f-structure is reached by multiple paths from an enclosing f-structure This formula matches the antecedent of the quantified NP meaning, so by universal instantiation and modus ponens we derive: With this derivation, there is only one quantifier meaning which scopes over the meaning of the coordinated material In our analysis, the f-structure for two trade bills is resource-shared as the object of the two verbs, just as it is in the coordinated case This also allows for our semantics of coordination not to require schemas nor entities of polymorphic type; our meaning of and is type
