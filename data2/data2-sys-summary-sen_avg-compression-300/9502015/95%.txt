 We now return to consider cases involving intensional verbs The meaning constructors for the lexical items are given in Figure  Finally, our account readily applies to cases of intensional verbs without coordination as in example ( since it applies more generally to cases of resource sharing For instance, in ( two extensional verbs and an intensional verb are coordinated LFG assumes two syntactic levels of representation: constituent structure (c-structure) encodes phrasal dominance and precedence relations, and functional structure (f-structure) encodes syntactic predicate-argument structure , the relation associates expressions in the meaning language with f-structures As a result, each f-structure contributed a single meaning constructor as a resource to be used in a derivation We refine our previous analysis to account for cases where an f-structure is reached by multiple paths from an enclosing f-structure In our analysis, the f-structure for two trade bills is resource-shared as the object of the two verbs, just as it is in the coordinated case
