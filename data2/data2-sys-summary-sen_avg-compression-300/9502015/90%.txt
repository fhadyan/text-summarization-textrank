 provides an account of LFG semantics that represents the meaning of lexical items with linear logic formulas We now return to consider cases involving intensional verbs The meaning constructors for the lexical items are given in Figure  It also predicts the desired reading for sentence ( since that reading requires two quantifiers Finally, our account readily applies to cases of intensional verbs without coordination as in example ( since it applies more generally to cases of resource sharing Two extensional verbs such as find and support are coordinated at their basic types: find and support (type Two intensional verbs such as want and seek are also coordinated at their basic (higher) types: want and seek (type The argument to this expression is a quantified NP For instance, in ( two extensional verbs and an intensional verb are coordinated LFG assumes two syntactic levels of representation: constituent structure (c-structure) encodes phrasal dominance and precedence relations, and functional structure (f-structure) encodes syntactic predicate-argument structure The f-structure for sentence ( ) is given in ( Lexical entries specify syntactic constraints on f-structures as well as semantic information: Semantic information is expressed in (1) a meaning language and (2) a language for assembling meanings, or glue language Expressions of the meaning language (such as Bill) appear on the right side of the meaning relation  , the relation associates expressions in the meaning language with f-structures As a result, each f-structure contributed a single meaning constructor as a resource to be used in a derivation That is, the f-structure Gf appears at the end of the singleton path P in the f-structure Ff We refine our previous analysis to account for cases where an f-structure is reached by multiple paths from an enclosing f-structure In our analysis, the f-structure for two trade bills is resource-shared as the object of the two verbs, just as it is in the coordinated case
