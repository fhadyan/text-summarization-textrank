 For the qualitative model, the operable notion of correspondence is based on logical equivalence and the constants are source word sense predicates and target sense predicates  A typical bilingual postulate for translating between p1 and q1 might be of the form:  This can be alleviated by placing restrictions on the form of meaning postulates and input formulas and using heuristic search methods Hierarchical phrases capturing recursive linguistic structure Hudson 1984  In our case, the dependency representation is monostratal in that the relations may include ones normally classified as belonging to syntax, semantics or pragmatics This lexical anchoring facilitates statistical training and sensitivity to lexical variation and collocations The model associates phrases with relation graphs A relation graph is a directed labeled graph consisting of a set of relation edges The speech recognizer produces a set of word-position hypotheses (perhaps in the form of a word lattice) corresponding to a set of string hypotheses for the input The source language model is used to compute a set of possible relation graphs, with associated probabilities, for each string hypothesis These target graphs include all the words of possible translations of the utterance hypotheses but do not specify the surface order of these words We are not considering training issues in this paper, though a number of now familiar techniques ranging from methods for maximum likelihood estimation to direct estimation using fully annotated data are applicable We now apply some simplifying independence assumptions concerning relation graphs Since As is given, 1/P(As) is a constant which can be ignored in finding the maximum of P(Wt | As  Chang, Luo, and Su 1992; Hindle and Rooth 1993  The language model factors the statistical derivation of a sentence with word string W as follows: where C ranges over relation graphs The content model, P(C and generation model, P(W | C are components of the overall statistical model for spoken language translation given earlier language production in context exactly one for each relation  The set of relation edges for the entire derivation is the union of these local edge sets We now return to the generation model P(W | C  Most language processing labeled as statistical involves associating real-number valued parameters to configurations of symbols One possibility is to use `bi-relation' parameters for the probability that an ri-dependent immediately follows an rj-dependent We can thus use these sequencing parameters directly in our overall model We call this approximating referential equivalence (1990) in their surface translation model The translation probability is then the sum of probabilities over different alignments f:  That is, the probability that f maps exactly the (possibly empty) subset of Nt to wi These subgraphs give rise to disjoint sets of relation edges which together form Et For simplicity, we assume here that the source graph Cs is a tree For the simple model it remains to specify derivation step probabilities The factoring of the translation model into these lexical and structural components means that it will overgenerate because these aspects are not independent in translation between real natural languages This can be done in a parallel fashion to the forward direction described above 1985) in the qualitative model Computationally, the quantitative model lets us escape from the undecidability of logic-based reasoning In particular, we preserved the notion of hierarchical phrase structure The quantitative model also reduced overall complexity in terms of the sets of symbols used Despite their apparent importance to translation, the quantitative system can avoid the use of word sense symbols (and the problems of granularity they give rise to) by exploiting statistical associations between words in the target language to filter implicit sense choices The translation relation is expressed by a set of first order axioms which are used by a theorem prover to derive a target language logical form that is equivalent (in some context) to the source logical form cm(w  There is also the problem of requiring increasingly complex feature sets to describe idiosyncrasies in the lexicon We can state this as follows:  Although there are compilation techniques (e In both the quantitative and qualitative models we take a transfer approach to translation
