 The POS tagging has been usually performed by statistical (or data/corpus-driven) approaches mainly using hidden markov model (HMM) [  For initial bootstrapping of HMM, we are provided with other 2000 morpheme tagged corpus which is disjoint from our original corpus Table shows the final tagging results This results demonstrate that the well-engineered HMM tagging with our error correcting rules can increase the overall tagging performance up to over 97% which was considered to be impossible with statistical tagging alone in English [  The system is trained in two phases: HMM parameter estimation and comparison-based rule learning for the HMM tagging output The TAKTAG has the unique following properties of the Korean POS disambiguation: The system is designed to be very accurate in tagging especially the ambiguous Korean morphemes that have more than one part-of-speeches The accuracy is very important in Korean tagging since Korean has much poorer tagging performance compared with English due to its linguistic characteristics The system fully considers many linguistic characteristics of Korean in HMM/rule tagging This is very important since the Korean tag sets are not stabilized yet, nor are the standard Korean tagged corpus provided yet Korean is classified as agglutinative languages in which the words (which is called Eojeol in Korean) consist of several morphemes that have clear-cut morpheme boundaries Below are the characteristic of Korean that must be considered for POS tag-set and tagging system design So contextual information for POS disambiguation must be selectively applied to the functional (bound) morphemes or content (free) morphemes The morphological analyzer must precede the tagging system because the morpheme segmentation is much more important and difficult than POS assignment in Korean For the above reasons, a morphological analysis play important roles in Korean POS tagging system Later, the tagging system disambiguates the POS assignments by selecting the single morpheme sequence for each sentence and the single POS tag for each morpheme by consulting the lexical and contextual information acquired from the corpus We classified over 200 POS tags that can be used in morphological analysis as well as the POS disambiguation For single morpheme, a path name in the POS symbol hierarchy (e In these languages, a word consists of single stem morpheme plus several functional morphemes, and the POS tags should be assigned to each morpheme to best exploit the complex morphological structures This tag-set will be used in our experiment in section  Figure shows a two-phase learning architecture for Korean POS tagging system The HMM tagger takes the morpheme sequence with the initial tag assignment by the morphological analyzer, and using the Viterbi algorithm [ searches the optimal tag sequence for the POS disambiguation The error-corrector transforms the first tagged morpheme sequences to the final tagged text Since the HMM tagger takes morpheme sequences as input, unlike English, the training corpus must be morphologically analyzed, too The POS tags are assigned to each original morpheme (in the training corpus) which is reconstructed from the spelling changes There can be many morphological analysis results for one sentence in Korean However, several studies show that using as much as tagged corpus for training gives much better performance on tagging [ and the fact favors for the Church [1988] style tagging as long as large tagged corpus is available for Korean The statistical morpheme tagging only covers the limited range of contextual information
