 Table shows the final tagging results The accuracy is very important in Korean tagging since Korean has much poorer tagging performance compared with English due to its linguistic characteristics The system fully considers many linguistic characteristics of Korean in HMM/rule tagging Below are the characteristic of Korean that must be considered for POS tag-set and tagging system design The morphological analyzer must precede the tagging system because the morpheme segmentation is much more important and difficult than POS assignment in Korean For the above reasons, a morphological analysis play important roles in Korean POS tagging system Figure shows a two-phase learning architecture for Korean POS tagging system Since the HMM tagger takes morpheme sequences as input, unlike English, the training corpus must be morphologically analyzed, too The statistical morpheme tagging only covers the limited range of contextual information
