 The POS tagging has been usually performed by statistical (or data/corpus-driven) approaches mainly using hidden markov model (HMM) [  Table shows the final tagging results The accuracy is very important in Korean tagging since Korean has much poorer tagging performance compared with English due to its linguistic characteristics The system fully considers many linguistic characteristics of Korean in HMM/rule tagging This is very important since the Korean tag sets are not stabilized yet, nor are the standard Korean tagged corpus provided yet Below are the characteristic of Korean that must be considered for POS tag-set and tagging system design So contextual information for POS disambiguation must be selectively applied to the functional (bound) morphemes or content (free) morphemes The morphological analyzer must precede the tagging system because the morpheme segmentation is much more important and difficult than POS assignment in Korean For the above reasons, a morphological analysis play important roles in Korean POS tagging system Later, the tagging system disambiguates the POS assignments by selecting the single morpheme sequence for each sentence and the single POS tag for each morpheme by consulting the lexical and contextual information acquired from the corpus Figure shows a two-phase learning architecture for Korean POS tagging system Since the HMM tagger takes morpheme sequences as input, unlike English, the training corpus must be morphologically analyzed, too However, several studies show that using as much as tagged corpus for training gives much better performance on tagging [ and the fact favors for the Church [1988] style tagging as long as large tagged corpus is available for Korean The statistical morpheme tagging only covers the limited range of contextual information
