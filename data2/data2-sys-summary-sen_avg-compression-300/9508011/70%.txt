 For an agent to be able to perform an action, it must satisfy both the physical and knowledge preconditions of that action ,  For a group of agents GR to have a full SharedPlan (FSP) for an act , they must satisfy the requirements given in Figure  For an utterance to begin a new segment, it must indicate the initiation of a subsidiary plan For an utterance to contribute to the current segment, it must advance the partial SharedPlan associated with the segment towards completion That is, it must establish one of the beliefs or intentions required for the discourse participants to have a full SharedPlan, but missing from their current partial SharedPlan For an utterance to complete the current segment, it must indicate that the purpose of that segment has been satisfied An OCP must provide a similar explanation for an ICP's initiation of a new discourse segment One plan is subsidiary to another if the completion of the first plan contributes to the completion of the second As indicated in Figure , a full plan for an act includes full plans for each subact in 's recipe as components (requirements (2c) and (3b  The plan in DSP2 is thus subsidiary to that in DSP1 by virtue of a knowledge precondition requirement of the latter plan Requirement (1) in Figure refers to the agents' recipe for  Each box in the figure corresponds to a discourse segment and contains the SharedPlan used to model the segment's purpose When plan Pj is subsidiary to plan Pi, DSPj is dominated by DSPi In contrast, alternative plan-based accounts of dialogue understanding introduce multiple types of plans to account for the utterances in a discourse For example, Litman and Allen , propose the use of two types of plans to model clarification and correction subdialogues: discourse plans and domain plans Domain plans represent knowledge about a task, while discourse plans represent conversational relationships between utterances and plans Litman and Allen provide operators for the following discourse plans: INTRODUCE-PLAN: introduce a new plan for discussion CONTINUE-PLAN: execute the next action in a plan TRACK-PLAN: talk about the execution of an action MODIFY-PLAN: introduce a new plan by modifying a previous one CORRECT-PLAN: correct a plan IDENTIFY-PARAMETER: identify a parameter of an action in a plan Under our approach, the recognition of discourse plans is unnecessary Grice  To perform an act , an agent must perform each constituent act in 's recipe according to the constraints of that recipe Rather, they simply fall out of recognizing the relationship of an utterance to the current discourse structure, i For example, INTRODUCE-PLAN corresponds to initiating a new discourse segment, CONTINUE- or TRACK-PLAN to contributing to the current segment, and IDENTIFY-PARAMETER to initiating a new segment to satisfy a hasdescr knowledge precondition requirement Although the initiation of a new SharedPlan corresponds to the initiation of a new discourse segment under our approach, it is the SharedPlan that must be recognized and not a discourse plan that refers to that SharedPlan Problem-solving plans, such as BUILD-PLAN and INSTANTIATE-VARS, are used to model the process by which agents construct domain plans The fact that an agent is building a plan or instantiating a variable is a byproduct of understanding an utterance by relating it to the current discourse structure BUILD-PLAN corresponds to initiating a new discourse segment to satisfy a hasrecipe knowledge precondition requirement, while INSTANTIATE-VARS corresponds to initiating one to satisfy a hasdescr requirement Ramshaw has added a different third type of plan, exploration plans, to Litman and Allen's two types Exploration plans are intended to model the process by which agents explore courses of actions For example, although the constraints of Litman and Allen's IDENTIFY-PARAMETER discourse plan force the plan to be related to another plan that involves the parameter to be identified, IDENTIFY-PARAMETER does not explain why this information is desired; it does not capture that agents need to know parameters to be able to perform acts involving them It thus fails to model the essential knowledge precondition nature of identifying a parameter In particular, they have argued that RST-based text plans must be augmented with intentional structure We have also shown how the requirements of knowledge preconditions can be used to account for information-seeking subdialogues in discourse Our account of this phenomenon fits within a general framework for discourse processing in which SharedPlans and relationships among them are used to model the intentional component of Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure Unlike the alternative approaches, our approach recognizes and makes use of discourse structure Agents need to know recipes for the acts they perform Agents must be able to identify the parameters of the acts they perform Agents may know only some descriptions of an actrecipe within the recursive plan definitions For an agent to be able to perform an act , it must know how to perform ; ie it must have a recipe for the act An agent must also be able to identify the parameters of an act to be able to perform it The relation is used to represent that agent Gcan identify the parameters of act at time T For an agent to suitably identify a parameter described as P, the agent must have a description, , of the parameter such that is of the appropriate sort We now show how the requirements of knowledge preconditions can be used in discourse processing Our model of discourse processing is based on the theory of discourse structure proposed by Grosz and Sidner  According to their theory, discourse structure consists of three interrelated components: a linguistic structure, an attentional state, and an intentional structure The linguistic structure consists of discourse segments and an embedding relationship among them; the bold rule in Figure indicates the linguistic structure of that discourse Intentional structure is comprised of discourse segment purposes and their interrelationships, particularly that of dominance A discourse segment purpose, or DSP, is a Gricean-like intention that leads to the initiation of a discourse segment Intentional structure plays a central role in discourse processing; an agent's comprehension of the utterances in a discourse relies on the recognition of this structure  They argued that discourses are fundamentally collaborative, and hence that a model of shared plans provides a more appropriate basis for discourse processing than a model of single-agent plans We have developed a model of discourse processing that provides that connection  Figure 3 illustrates the role of SharedPlans in modeling intentional structure Each segment of a discourse has an associated SharedPlan The SharedPlan formalism is a mental-state model of collaborative plans with roots in Pollack's work on single-agent plans The purpose of the segment is taken to be intention that (Int nTh ) the discourse participants form that plan Dominance relationships between DSPs are modeled using subsidiary relationships between SharedPlans One plan is subsidiary to another if the completion of the first plan contributes to the completion of the second Subsidiary relationships are discussed in more detail in Section The utterances of a discourse are understood in terms of their contribution to the SharedPlans associated with the segments of the discourse Figure 3: Modeling Intentional Structure For each utterance of a discourse, an agent must determine whether the utterance begins a new segment of the discourse, contributes to the current segment, or completes it
