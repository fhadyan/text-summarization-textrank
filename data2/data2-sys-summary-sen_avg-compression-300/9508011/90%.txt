 For an utterance to begin a new segment, it must indicate the initiation of a subsidiary plan An OCP must provide a similar explanation for an ICP's initiation of a new discourse segment Each box in the figure corresponds to a discourse segment and contains the SharedPlan used to model the segment's purpose For example, Litman and Allen , propose the use of two types of plans to model clarification and correction subdialogues: discourse plans and domain plans Domain plans represent knowledge about a task, while discourse plans represent conversational relationships between utterances and plans Litman and Allen provide operators for the following discourse plans: INTRODUCE-PLAN: introduce a new plan for discussion CONTINUE-PLAN: execute the next action in a plan TRACK-PLAN: talk about the execution of an action MODIFY-PLAN: introduce a new plan by modifying a previous one CORRECT-PLAN: correct a plan IDENTIFY-PARAMETER: identify a parameter of an action in a plan Under our approach, the recognition of discourse plans is unnecessary Grice descr knowledge precondition requirement Although the initiation of a new SharedPlan corresponds to the initiation of a new discourse segment under our approach, it is the SharedPlan that must be recognized and not a discourse plan that refers to that SharedPlan BUILD-PLAN corresponds to initiating a new discourse segment to satisfy a hasdescr requirement Agents must be able to identify the parameters of the acts they perform Agents may know only some descriptions of an actrecipe within the recursive plan definitions We now show how the requirements of knowledge preconditions can be used in discourse processing Our model of discourse processing is based on the theory of discourse structure proposed by Grosz and Sidner  The linguistic structure consists of discourse segments and an embedding relationship among them; the bold rule in Figure indicates the linguistic structure of that discourse Intentional structure is comprised of discourse segment purposes and their interrelationships, particularly that of dominance A discourse segment purpose, or DSP, is a Gricean-like intention that leads to the initiation of a discourse segment Intentional structure plays a central role in discourse processing; an agent's comprehension of the utterances in a discourse relies on the recognition of this structure  Each segment of a discourse has an associated SharedPlan Figure 3: Modeling Intentional Structure For each utterance of a discourse, an agent must determine whether the utterance begins a new segment of the discourse, contributes to the current segment, or completes it
