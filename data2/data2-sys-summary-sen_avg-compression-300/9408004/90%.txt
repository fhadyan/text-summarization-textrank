g a GB grammar O(2[n ,  structure proposing engines) while keeping the grammar constant A small principle-based parser was built, following the proper branch formalism developed in  X-bar Theory uses a set of schemata to license local subtrees Specifier (SPEC this feature specifies whether the word at the head of the phrase being built requires a specifier The head (i the main verbs were all from the set for which theta role data was obtained the examples were manually parsed by the authors a transitive verb has one theta role to `discharge' which must be assigned to an NP The easiest method of obtaining and applying theta probabilities will be with reference to whole theta grids Although the distinction between complements and adjuncts is a theoretically interesting one, the process of determining which constructions fill which functional roles in the analysis of real text often creates a number of problems (see for discussion on this issue regarding output of the Fidditch parser  If we are to implement a probabilistic version of a modular grammar theory incorporating a Case component, a relevant question is: are there multiple ways of assigning Case to noun phrases in a sentence? i it is possible to satisfy the Case filter in more than one way, for probabilities associated with the module to be of any use The use of a heterogeneous grammar formalism and multiple probabilities invokes the problem of their combination Alternatively, a combination of some or all of the daughters' probability features could be employed, thus making, eg the X-bar probability of the mother dependent upon all the stochastic information from the daughters, including theta and Case probabilities, etc X-bar, Theta the probabilities at the top level will have been calculated using informationally distinct figures the X-bar, theta, etc was kept constant
