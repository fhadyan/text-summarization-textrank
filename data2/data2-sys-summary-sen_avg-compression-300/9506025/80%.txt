 The division of morphology and syntax in agglutinative languages is difficult compared to relatively more isolating languages However, the scoping problems in morphosyntax go beyond bracketing paradoxes as they may also produce different semantic forms In order to perform morphological and syntactic compositions in a unified (monostratal) framework, the slash operators of categorial grammar must be enriched with the knowledge about the type of process and the type of morpheme The 3-tuple (direction, morpheme type, process type) indicates direction (left, right, unspecified morpheme type (free, bound and the type of morphological or syntactic attachment (e Examples of different operator combinations are as follows: Entries in the categorial lexicon have tactical constraints, grammatical and semantic features, and phonological representation Syntactic and semantic information are of grammatical (g) sign and semantic (s) sign, respectively PHON represents the phonological stringg 3iyi oku-mus ocuk well read-REL child 'well-educated child' In ( the relative suffix -mus (in past form of subject participle) modifies [iyi oku] to give the scope iyi oku]mus] ocuk  PHON also allows efficient lexicon search If syntactic composition is performed after morphological composition, we would get compositions such as [iyi [okumus ocuk or iyi okumus] ocuk which yield ill-formed semantics for this utterance
