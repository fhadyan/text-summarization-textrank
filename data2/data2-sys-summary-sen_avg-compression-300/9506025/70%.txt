 The division of morphology and syntax in agglutinative languages is difficult compared to relatively more isolating languages In word formation, morphological bracketing paradoxes are introduced by lexicalized composite affixes which require mixed compositions  However, the scoping problems in morphosyntax go beyond bracketing paradoxes as they may also produce different semantic forms In order to perform morphological and syntactic compositions in a unified (monostratal) framework, the slash operators of categorial grammar must be enriched with the knowledge about the type of process and the type of morpheme The 3-tuple (direction, morpheme type, process type) indicates direction (left, right, unspecified morpheme type (free, bound and the type of morphological or syntactic attachment (e Examples of different operator combinations are as follows: Entries in the categorial lexicon have tactical constraints, grammatical and semantic features, and phonological representation Moreover, the head that a bound morpheme modifies may be not its stem but a compound head crossing over the word boundaries, e Syntactic and semantic information are of grammatical (g) sign and semantic (s) sign, respectively RES-OP-ARG is the categorial notation for the element Lexical and phrasal elements have functional representation (f or p sign) and the PHON feature PHON represents the phonological string During composition, the surface forms of composed elements are mapped and saved in PHONg 3iyi oku-mus ocuk well read-REL child 'well-educated child' In ( the relative suffix -mus (in past form of subject participle) modifies [iyi oku] to give the scope iyi oku]mus] ocuk  PHON also allows efficient lexicon search If syntactic composition is performed after morphological composition, we would get compositions such as [iyi [okumus ocuk or iyi okumus] ocuk which yield ill-formed semantics for this utterance As a computational counterpart of this idea, rather than treating morphology, syntax and semantics in a cascaded manner, we integrate the process models of morphology and syntax, providing semantic composition in parallel
