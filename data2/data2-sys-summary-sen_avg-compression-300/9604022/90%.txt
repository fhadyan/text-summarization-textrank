 After a successful application of the merging, the resulting rule substitutes the two merged ones The task of assigning a set of POS-tags to a word is actually quite similar to the task of document categorisation where a document should be assigned with a set of descriptors which represent its contents There were two types of data in use at this stage In Table 1 some results of that experiment are shown In average ending-guessing rules were detected to cover over 96% of the unknown words It can also handle 6% less unknown words which, in fact, might decrease its performance even lower Virtually almost every word which can be guessed by the morphological rules is guessed exactly correct (97% recall and 97% precision  This actually proves that the E75 rule-set fully supercedes the Xerox rule-set Both of the taggers come with data and word-guessing components pre-trained on the Brown Corpus In the evaluation of tagging accuracy on unknown words we pay attention to two metrics We tagged several texts of different origins, except from the Brown Corpus For each text we performed two tagging experiments This text was detected to have 347 unknown words The results of this tagging are summarised in Table 35% to 925% for both taggers The results of this tagging are summarised in Table 45% for Brill's tagger Two types of mis-taggings caused by the guessers occured This technique does not require specially prepared training data and uses for training the lexicon and word frequencies collected from a raw corpus The cascading guesser outperformed the guesser supplied with the Xerox tagger by about 8-9% and the guesser supplied with Brill's tagger by about 6-7  This, actually, results in about 2% higher accuracy of tagging on unknown words The acquired guessing rules employed in our cascading guesser are, in fact, of a standard nature and in that form or another are used in other POS-guessers One of the most important issues in the induction of guessing rule-sets is the choice right data for training Thus the major factor in the learning process is the lexicon The corresponding corpus should include most of the words from the lexicon and be large enough to obtain reliable estimates of word-frequency distribution the lexicon The acquisition of word- POS guessing rules is a three-step procedure which includes the rule extraction, rule scoring and rule merging phases At the rule extraction phase, three sets of word-guessing rules (morphological prefix guessing rules, morphological suffix guessing rules and ending-guessing rules) are extracted from the lexicon and cleaned from coincidental cases Morphological word-guessing rules describe how one word can be guessed given that another word is known There are two kinds of morphological rules to be learned: suffix rules (A[s rules which are applied to the tail of a word, and prefix rules (A[p rules which are applied to the beginning of a word Thus two different sets of guessing rules prefix and suffix morphological rules together with their frequencies are produced Unlike morphological guessing rules, ending-guessing rules do not require the main form of an unknown word to be listed in the lexicon Such rules are able to cover more unknown words than morphological guessing rules but their accuracy will not be as high05 = 1
