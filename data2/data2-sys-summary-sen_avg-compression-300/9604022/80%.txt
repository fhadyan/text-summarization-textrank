 Words unknown to the lexicon present a substantial problem to part-of-speech ( POS) tagging of real-world texts The method for setting up this threshold is based on empirical evaluations of the rule-sets and is described in Section  After a successful application of the merging, the resulting rule substitutes the two merged ones The task of assigning a set of POS-tags to a word is actually quite similar to the task of document categorisation where a document should be assigned with a set of descriptors which represent its contents There were two types of data in use at this stage In Table 1 some results of that experiment are shown One can notice a slight difference in the results obtained over the lexicon and the corpus In average ending-guessing rules were detected to cover over 96% of the unknown words It can also handle 6% less unknown words which, in fact, might decrease its performance even lower In comparison with the ending-guessing rules, the morphological rules have much better precision and hence better accuracy of guessing Virtually almost every word which can be guessed by the morphological rules is guessed exactly correct (97% recall and 97% precision  After obtaining the optimal rule-sets we performed the same experiment on a word-sample which was not included into the training lexicon and corpus5% for Ending 75 and Xerox rule-sets and 7% for the Suffix 60 rule-set This, actually, did not come as a surprise, since many main forms required by the suffix rules were missing in the lexicon Table 2 demonstrates some results of this experiment This actually proves that the E75 rule-set fully supercedes the Xerox rule-set Brill outlines a transformation-based learner which learns guessing rules from a pre-tagged training corpus In this evaluation we tried two different taggers Both of the taggers come with data and word-guessing components pre-trained on the Brown Corpus In the evaluation of tagging accuracy on unknown words we pay attention to two metrics In this case, however, we do not account for the known words which were mis-tagged because of the guessers We tagged several texts of different origins, except from the Brown Corpus For each text we performed two tagging experiments In the second experiment we tagged the same text with the lexicon which contained only closed-class and short words We obtained quite stable results in these experiments This text was detected to have 347 unknown words The results of this tagging are summarised in Table 35% to 925% for both taggers The results of this tagging are summarised in Table 45% for Brill's tagger In this paper we describe a new fully automatic technique for learning part-of-speech guessing rules The accuracy of the tagging on unknown words dropped by about 5% in general Two types of mis-taggings caused by the guessers occured We presented a technique for fully unsupervised statistical acquisition of rules which guess possible parts-of-speech for words unknown to the lexicon So, first words are looked up in the lexicon This technique does not require specially prepared training data and uses for training the lexicon and word frequencies collected from a raw corpus To select best performing guessing rule-sets we suggested an evaluation methodology, which is solely dedicated to the performance of part-of-speech guessers The cascading guesser outperformed the guesser supplied with the Xerox tagger by about 8-9% and the guesser supplied with Brill's tagger by about 6-7  This makes the accuracy drop caused by the cascading guesser to be less than 6% in general Another important conclusion from the evaluation experiments is that the morphological guessing rules do improve the guessing performance This, actually, results in about 2% higher accuracy of tagging on unknown words The acquired guessing rules employed in our cascading guesser are, in fact, of a standard nature and in that form or another are used in other POS-guessers One of the most important issues in the induction of guessing rule-sets is the choice right data for training Thus the major factor in the learning process is the lexicon The corresponding corpus should include most of the words from the lexicon and be large enough to obtain reliable estimates of word-frequency distribution This would account for cases like try - tries reduce - reducing advise - advisable  This information can be compiled automatically and also might improve the accuracy of tagging unknown words the lexicon The acquisition of word- POS guessing rules is a three-step procedure which includes the rule extraction, rule scoring and rule merging phases At the rule extraction phase, three sets of word-guessing rules (morphological prefix guessing rules, morphological suffix guessing rules and ending-guessing rules) are extracted from the lexicon and cleaned from coincidental cases At the scoring phase, each rule is scored in accordance with its accuracy of guessing and the best scored rules are included into the final rule-sets Morphological word-guessing rules describe how one word can be guessed given that another word is known There are two kinds of morphological rules to be learned: suffix rules (A[s rules which are applied to the tail of a word, and prefix rules (A[p rules which are applied to the beginning of a word To extract such rules a special operator is applied to every pair of words from the lexicon Thus two different sets of guessing rules prefix and suffix morphological rules together with their frequencies are produced Next, from these sets of guessing rules we need to cut out infrequent rules which might bias the further learning process Unlike morphological guessing rules, ending-guessing rules do not require the main form of an unknown word to be listed in the lexicon Such rules are able to cover more unknown words than morphological guessing rules but their accuracy will not be as high The operator is applied to each entry in the lexicon in the way described for the operator of the morphological rules and then infrequent rules with are filtered out To perform this experiment we take one-by-one each rule from the rule-sets produced at the rule extraction phase, take each word token from the corpus and guess its POS-set using the rule if the rule is applicable to the word For example, if a guessing rule strips a particular suffix and a current word from the corpus does not have this suffix, we classify these word and rule as incompatible and the rule as not applicable to that word In a system of rules which uses both ending-guessing and more morphologically motivated rules is described This estimation of the rule value in fact resembles that used by for scoring POS-disambiguation rules for the French tagger05 = 1
