 In this paper, I combine their account of pitch accent semantics with Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein's (1989) account of centering to yield insights into the phenomenon of pitch accented pronominals, and the attentional consequences of pitch accents in general Both attentional (Cf) and propositional (mutual beliefs) structures are updated throughout Centering theories would be hard pressed to predict pitch accents on pronominals, on grounds of redundancy (2) Pitch accents on pronominals are primarily interpreted for what they say about attentional salience Because nonpronominals contribute discourse content, pitch accented nonpronominals are mainly interpreted with respect to the mutual beliefs, that is, for their propositional content Therefore pitch accented pronominals are mainly interpreted with respect to Cf, for their attentional content By combining Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg's (1990) analysis of intonational meaning with Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein's (1989) theory of centering in discourse, the attentional affect of pitch accents becomes evident, and the paradox of pitch accented pronominals unravels
