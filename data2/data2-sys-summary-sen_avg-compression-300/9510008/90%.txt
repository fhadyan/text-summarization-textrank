 Recently, RD efforts involving machine translation of different language families, such as Japanese and English, have become popular , ,  The Multi-Level Translation Method has enabled a precise enumeration of conditions for the application of rules through detailed semantic categories ALT-J/E has, in addition to the semantic structure dictionary and semantic categories, introduced an analysis of the semantic categories of predicates which allows the supplemention of ellipses using the semantic relations between sentences ALT-J/E uses semantic categories to analyze compound words to find the semantic relationships of their constituents This function makes the translation of unknown compound words possible The experimental Japanese-to-English machine translation system ALT-J/E, based on the Multi-Level Translation Method, is currently being debugged It has shown that the method enables a Japanese-to-English machine translation system to function effectively without manual pre-editing We call the limited use of semantic information used in the Multi-Level Translation Method meaning analysis Japanese-to-English machine translation has reached the stage where sentences that allow word-by-word transfer from Japanese to English, followed by assembly into the final sentence form (i It is a method of translation which grasps the structure and meanings of expressions as a whole This knowledge is being used in analysis of the Japanese language and conversion of the Japanese into English We classify these concepts as SEMANTIC CATEGORIES The semantic categories are ordered into two IS-A hierarchies These are the common noun semantic categories, some 2,800 categories (12 levels deep and the proper noun semantic categories, some 200 categories (9 levels deep  Based on this ontology, a semantic word dictionary was compiled with 400,000 index words The maximum number of semantic categories per word is 5 common noun categories and 10 proper noun categories The basic structure of Japanese sentences revolves mainly around predicates Each Japanese entry has an English translation As soon as the structure of the Japanese is determined in the source language analysis, the basic English structure can be determined from the English form structure in the semantic structure dictionary
