 Thus, although somewhat overly harsh, the heuristic is quite effective in identifying bad parses95 - 105) for each word of the original sentence that was skipped Training of the probabilities is performed on a set of disambiguated parses A list of common appearing substitutions was constructed from the development set95 and 1 Our goal was three-fold The first run was with skipping disabled The second run was conducted with skipping enabled and full heuristics The results indicate that using the GLR* parser results in a significant improvement in performance Fully 96% of the test sentences (all but 5) are parsable by GLR
