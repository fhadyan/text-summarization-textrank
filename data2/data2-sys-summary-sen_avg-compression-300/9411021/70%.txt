 CUG (Categorial Unification Grammar) is advantageous, compared to other phrase structure grammars, for parallel architecture, because we can regard categories as functional types and we can represent grammar rules locally This means that we do not need externally-given grammar rules but those rules reside within each word or each phrase We use greek letters, for type schemas For type constants we use while for type variables we use represents that the object a is of type  The purpose of type inference is to infer the type of an object from a set of objects whose types are known For example, all the linguistic objects, such as words and phrases must be applied to so-called grammar rules to form grammatical structures or rational semantic representations, under a strict controller process The ordinary lambda-calculus requires a strict order of conversion We can regard the whole sentence structure as more grammatical if the sum of these unification costs is smaller In this paper, we will mention our principles on natural language processing with regard to the ChAM model We assume the process of natural language recognition as follows Verbs and some other auxiliary verbs introduces membranes In order to represent grammar rules distributively, we adopt categorial grammar, where we can an attach local grammar rule to each word and phrase These membranes becomes their scopes for case (or role) domination; namely, each verb searches for molecules (noun phrases) that are necessary to satisfy each verb's case (role) frame, within its membrane In some occasions, if multiple verbs exist in one sentence, they may conflict as to which verb dominates which noun phrase If one membrane contains only one composite structure, and it still has surplus valences, we can regard that whole the membrane has those surplus valences as follows These auxiliary verbs as well as ordinary verbs can dominate some cases so that these agglutinations may change the whole syntax  Namely the scope of the operation of these auxiliary verbs is not the operated verb but the whole sentence represents that the verb `yomu (read requires two roles `the reader' and `the object to be read and one optional role `the counter-agent' who hears what the reader reads The DAG in Fig Thereafter we introduce the ChAM model and we reinterpret the model in terms of natural language processings The second membrane s2 requires an agent role (the variable x' of make  However, because both of and unifies nominative case and agent role, the costs are equivalent In this case, the agent of makeshould be the nominative of the whole sentence, and the co-agent of make is the dative of the whole sentence, so that K and N are bit by newly arrived make Introducing free-ordered typed lambda-calculus, together with the notion of unification costs in types, we have shown the structuring of natural language syntax, by distributively represented types in random orders Then we show the model of membrane interaction model with the example of Japanese causative sentence that requires drastic change of domination of cases We adopted a model of Chemical Abstract Machine for the partial/ concurrent computation model
