 CUG (Categorial Unification Grammar) is advantageous, compared to other phrase structure grammars, for parallel architecture, because we can regard categories as functional types and we can represent grammar rules locally We can regard the whole sentence structure as more grammatical if the sum of these unification costs is smaller Verbs and some other auxiliary verbs introduces membranes In order to represent grammar rules distributively, we adopt categorial grammar, where we can an attach local grammar rule to each word and phrase These membranes becomes their scopes for case (or role) domination; namely, each verb searches for molecules (noun phrases) that are necessary to satisfy each verb's case (role) frame, within its membrane If one membrane contains only one composite structure, and it still has surplus valences, we can regard that whole the membrane has those surplus valences as follows Then we show the model of membrane interaction model with the example of Japanese causative sentence that requires drastic change of domination of cases
