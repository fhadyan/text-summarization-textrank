 If a clause with garu/gat-ta is a subordinate clause, the experiencer cannot be identified with a semantic role corresponding to the subject of main clause or higher clause Therefore unlike the garu/gat-ta case, the experiencer also can be an obligatory semantic role of higher clause as well as the speaker This FS is the result of the unification between the FSs of subordinate clause and main clause, where the contents of syntactic feature HEAD , namely is omitted The key point of the semantics of complex sentence is the role motivated that appears in which corresponds to the content of the subordinate clause The role motivated is the link between the content of subordinate clause and the main clause Definition 2 (Motivated) Motivated is a person who is affected by the situation described by the subordinate clause deeply enough to feel or act as the main clause describes The important and indispensable part of semantics of complex sentence is, roughly speaking, the relation between a subordinate clause and the main clause But if you look more closely, this relation is actually the relations among semantic/pragmatic roles appearing in the subordinate clause and those appearing in the main clause More precisely, in FS, our main concerns are which semantic role in the SEM of subordinate clause the motivated can or cannot be unified with, and which semantic role in the SEM of main clause the motivated can or cannot be unified with In this subsection, we propose the constraints on complex sentence For this, at first we categorize the relations between subordinate clause and main clause based on their semantics , where SC and MC mean `subordinate clause' and `main clause' respectively In this table, the first column is for a name of sentence type, the second column indicates a rough meaning of the relation between subordinate clause SC and main clause MC of complex sentence, and the third column shows Japanese conjunctive particles used to represent a type of complex sentence in the same row We don't deal with type 4, because a temporal adverbial clause just describes an event that occurs before, simultaneously or after another event which is described by the main clause Therefore generally we don't expect essential information for relations among semantic roles appearing in adverbial or main clause from this type of sentence In Table we show the constraints that say which semantic/pragmatic role of subordinate clause can be a motivated Table shows which semantic role of main clause can be unified with the motivated Consider the following sentence shows predicate patterns of subordinate clause, and the third column of Table shows semantic categories of predicate of main clause are local in a subordinate clause, because both sides of = of constraints are roles of subordinate clause Constraints in Table are also local in a main clause because every semantic role that appeares in the righthand side of the constraints is defined within the main clause Needless to say, the influence from a subordinate clause comes only via role motivated The constraints to be applied are S1 and M1 as you know from the contents of subordinate and main clause By combination of S1 and M1, zero agent of main clause: is the observer of the situation described by the subordinate clause, where behaved like feeling cold `Although behaved like feeling bad, didn't take a medicine at last `Although wanted to stay, finally forced him out In both of ( ) and ( the motivateds of subordinate clause are constrained by S2, namely motivateds can be either or the observer of subordinate clause An example sentence is the following apply, is an affected of attacking event described in the subordinate clause In other words, primarily a constraint satisfaction process of a subordinate clause can be done within the analysis of subordinate clause, and that of the main clause can be done within it except for using motivated whose value has already been constrained in the subordinate clause In , it is said that if garu is used in a subordinate clause, the subject of the main clause is not the experiencer of the subordinate clause In , she says that 1) a cognizer that corresponds to our observer is introduced if garu is used, and 2) if an observer is introduced in the subordinate clause, the mentally responsible person appearing in the main clause is identical with the observer Namely, since we use semantic/pragmatic roles instead of grammatical roles in constraints, our constraints can account for zero anaphora in a sentence where the main clause is passive where an agent or an experiencer is not necessarily the subject, like the following example This localization also makes the proposed constraints be compositional ones, because in the case of deeply embedded complex sentence to identify the referent of each motivated that bridges between a subordinate clause and its main clause, the constraints we proposed are resolved with computation confined within each clause To apply the centering theory that is originally for a sequence of sentences, namely discourse, we regard the subordinate clause and the main clause as a segment of discourse respectively Then, the topic Hanako is the strongest candidate for the backward center of the subordinate clause Therefore the backward center of the subordinate clause is Hanako, and consequently zero subject refers to Hanako By the same way as the subordinate clause case is dealt with, the zero subject of the main clause is known to refer to Hanako, too Then we shift our attention to more microscopic one, in which ,roughly speaking, the important part of semantics of complex sentence is formalized as relations among semantic roles that appear in the main clause or the subordinate clause At the first glance, the constraints about these relations are not local in terms of main or subordinate clauses In other words, semantic roles that appear in subordinate clause and semantic roles that appear in the main clause seem to be directly constrained by the constraints of complex sentence However, looking more carefully, we find that the constraints of subordinate clause and the constraints of main clause are represented as local constraints by introducing the new notion of motivated which is characterized as a person who has enough reason to act as the main clause describes More precisely, motivated is one of the pragmatic roles that appear in a subordinate clause, and the constraints in subordinate clause are stated as identity relations between motivated and other semantic/pragmatic roles appearing in subordinate clause Therefore these constraints are local in subordinate clause The constraints in main clause are stated as identity relations between motivated which comes from subordinate clause, and other semantic roles appearing in main clause Therefore in understanding the main clause we don't have to be care about semantic/pragmatic roles in subordinate clause other than a motivated In this sense, the constraints in the main clause can be treated as almost local constraints of the main clause Mikami categorized clauses into three classes, namely `open `semi-open' and `closed This categorization indicates how freely the content of clause interacts with the outside of clause For instance, they are categorized by the degree of possibilities of coreference between zero pronouns inside the subordinate clause and nominal or topic that appear in the main clause1 , Sub-Clause and Conjunct mean subordinate clause and conjunctive particle respectively In each category of 2,3,4,5 and 6, exists there a person who is affected by the situation described by the subordinate clause In our theory, this affected person plays a key role for semantics of complex sentence As you will see later, this newly introduced role is playing a key role which bridges semantic roles of subordinate clause to semantic roles of main clause
