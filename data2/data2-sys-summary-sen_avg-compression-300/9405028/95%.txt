 If a clause with garu/gat-ta is a subordinate clause, the experiencer cannot be identified with a semantic role corresponding to the subject of main clause or higher clause The role motivated is the link between the content of subordinate clause and the main clause For this, at first we categorize the relations between subordinate clause and main clause based on their semantics , where SC and MC mean `subordinate clause' and `main clause' respectively Table shows which semantic role of main clause can be unified with the motivated Consider the following sentence shows semantic categories of predicate of main clause are local in a subordinate clause, because both sides of = of constraints are roles of subordinate clause In , it is said that if garu is used in a subordinate clause, the subject of the main clause is not the experiencer of the subordinate clause More precisely, motivated is one of the pragmatic roles that appear in a subordinate clause, and the constraints in subordinate clause are stated as identity relations between motivated and other semantic/pragmatic roles appearing in subordinate clause Therefore these constraints are local in subordinate clause The constraints in main clause are stated as identity relations between motivated which comes from subordinate clause, and other semantic roles appearing in main clause
