 We compare ADs to TODs with respect to how often control is exchanged by calculating the average number of turns between control shifts We also investigate whether control is shared equally between participants and what percentage of control shifts are represented by abdications, interrupts, and summaries for each dialogue type See Figure  The expert has control for around 90% of utterances in the TODs whereas control is shared almost equally in the ADs We found shifts of attentional state when shifts in control are negotiated and agreed by all participants, but not when control is seized by one participant without the acceptance of the others These results provide support for the control rules control shifts do not always correspond with task boundaries The listener certainly must recognize this fact The application of the control rules to these dialogues lets us derive domain-independent discourse segments with each segment being controlled by one or other discourse participant We propose that control segments correspond to different subgoals in the evolving discourse plan When a different participant assumes control of a discourse subgoal then a control shift occurs and the participants must have mechanisms for achieving this The control framework distinguishes instances in which a control shift is negotiated by the participants and instances where one participant seizes control We predict shifts of attentional state when shifts in control are negotiated and agreed by all participants, but not when control is seized by one participant without the acceptance of the others The control rules place a segment boundary whenever the roles of the participants (ICP or OCP) change The boundaries fell into one of three types: CONTROL SHIFT TYPES ABDICATION: Okay, go on As INITIATIVE passes back and forth between the discourse participants, we say that CONTROL over the conversation gets transferred from one discourse participant to another Thus orderly control shifts occur when the controller explicitly indicates that s/he wishes to relinquish control To determine the relationship between the derived control segments and ATTENTIONAL STATE we looked at the distribution of anaphora with respect to the control segments in the ADs One discourse participant uses an anaphor to summarize a plan, but when the other participant evaluates this plan there may be a control shift and any reference to the plan will necessarily cross a control boundary
