 The financial ADs had 45 event anaphors in 474 utterances To explore the relationship of control to planning, we compare the TODs with both types of ADs (financial and support  This information must be exchanged, so that the mutual beliefs necessary to develop the collaborative plan are established in the conversation  PLAN QUALITY: The listener must believe that the action proposed by the speaker is a part of an adequate plan to achieve the mutual goal and the action must also be comprehensible to the listener We compare ADs to TODs with respect to how often control is exchanged by calculating the average number of turns between control shifts We also investigate whether control is shared equally between participants and what percentage of control shifts are represented by abdications, interrupts, and summaries for each dialogue type See Figure  As we predicted, the distribution of control between expert and client is completely different in the ADs and the TODs The expert has control for around 90% of utterances in the TODs whereas control is shared almost equally in the ADs Second, control was exchanged when the execution of the task started to go awry We found shifts of attentional state when shifts in control are negotiated and agreed by all participants, but not when control is seized by one participant without the acceptance of the others Event anaphora clustered at segment boundaries when it was used to refer to preceding segments and was more likely to cross segment boundaries because of its function in talking about the proposed plan We also found that control was distributed and exchanged differently in the ADs and TODs These results provide support for the control rules We also believe that there are other levels of structure in discourse that are not captured by the control rules, e control shifts do not always correspond with task boundaries There can be topic shifts without change of initiation, change of control without a topic shift  We model mixed-initiative using an utterance type classification and a set of rules for transfer of control between discourse participants that were proposed by Whittaker and Stenton  Hobbs has some difficulties determining the function of this repetition, but we maintain that the function follows from the more general principles of the control rules: speakers signal that they wish to shift control by supplying no new propositional content The listener certainly must recognize this fact We evaluate the generality of this analysis by applying the control rules to 4 sets of dialogues, including both advisory dialogues (ADs) and task-oriented dialogues (TODs  Information is exchanged by MIXED-INITIATIVE The application of the control rules to these dialogues lets us derive domain-independent discourse segments with each segment being controlled by one or other discourse participant We propose that control segments correspond to different subgoals in the evolving discourse plan A final phenomenon concerns shifts of control and the devices used to achieve this Control shifts occur because it is unusual for a single participant to be responsible for coordinating the achievement of the whole discourse plan When a different participant assumes control of a discourse subgoal then a control shift occurs and the participants must have mechanisms for achieving this The control framework distinguishes instances in which a control shift is negotiated by the participants and instances where one participant seizes control We predict shifts of attentional state when shifts in control are negotiated and agreed by all participants, but not when control is seized by one participant without the acceptance of the others To test predictions about the distribution of control in different types of dialogues Because the TOD's embody the master-slave assumption , and control is allocated to the expert, our expectation is that control should be located exclusively with one participant in the TODs in contrast with the ADs We use the framework for the allocation and transfer of control of Whittaker and Stenton  CONTROL RULES The definition of controller can be seen to correspond to the intuitions behind the term INITIATING CONVERSATIONAL PARTICIPANT (ICP who is defined as the initiator of a given discourse segment  The OTHER CONVERSATIONAL PARTICIPANT(S OCP, may speak some utterances in a segment, but the DISCOURSE SEGMENT PURPOSE, must be the purpose of the ICP The control rules place a segment boundary whenever the roles of the participants (ICP or OCP) change For example: Whittaker and Stenton also performed a post-hoc analysis of the segment boundaries that are defined by the control rules The boundaries fell into one of three types: CONTROL SHIFT TYPES ABDICATION: Okay, go on As INITIATIVE passes back and forth between the discourse participants, we say that CONTROL over the conversation gets transferred from one discourse participant to another Thus orderly control shifts occur when the controller explicitly indicates that s/he wishes to relinquish control The remaining class, INTERRUPTIONS, characterize shifts occurring when the noncontroller displays initiative by seizing control This classification suggests that the transfer of control is often a collaborative phenomenon Since a noncontroller(OCP has the option of seizing control at any juncture in discourse, it would seem that controllers(ICPs are in control because the noncontroller allows it The claim is that shifts of control often do not occur until the controller indicates the end of a discourse segment by abdicating or producing a repetition/summary To determine the relationship between the derived control segments and ATTENTIONAL STATE we looked at the distribution of anaphora with respect to the control segments in the ADs05 level This was especially apparent in cases where one discourse participant interrupted briefly, then immediately passed control back to the other The control segments as defined would treat both of these cases as composed of 3 different segments Previous studies of the discourse structure of multi-participant dialogues have often factored out the role of MIXED-INITIATIVE, by allocating control to one participant , , or by assuming a passive listener ,  These are labelled X (cross segment boundary antecedent) NX (no cross segment boundary in Figure  In addition we break these down as to which type of control shift occurred at the previous segment boundary For both dialogues, the distribution of anaphors varies according to which type of control shift occurred at the previous segment boundary What does this mean? The fact that anaphora is more likely to cross segment boundaries following interruptions than for summaries or abdications is consistent with the control principles With both summaries and abdications the speaker gives an explicit signal that s/he wishes to relinquish control More importantly these references are closely related to the control structure The example above illustrates the clustering of event anaphora at segment boundaries One discourse participant uses an anaphor to summarize a plan, but when the other participant evaluates this plan there may be a control shift and any reference to the plan will necessarily cross a control boundary
