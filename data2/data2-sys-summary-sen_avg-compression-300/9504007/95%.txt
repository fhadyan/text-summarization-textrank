 We compare ADs to TODs with respect to how often control is exchanged by calculating the average number of turns between control shifts See Figure  The expert has control for around 90% of utterances in the TODs whereas control is shared almost equally in the ADs These results provide support for the control rules control shifts do not always correspond with task boundaries We propose that control segments correspond to different subgoals in the evolving discourse plan When a different participant assumes control of a discourse subgoal then a control shift occurs and the participants must have mechanisms for achieving this The control framework distinguishes instances in which a control shift is negotiated by the participants and instances where one participant seizes control The control rules place a segment boundary whenever the roles of the participants (ICP or OCP) change Thus orderly control shifts occur when the controller explicitly indicates that s/he wishes to relinquish control One discourse participant uses an anaphor to summarize a plan, but when the other participant evaluates this plan there may be a control shift and any reference to the plan will necessarily cross a control boundary
