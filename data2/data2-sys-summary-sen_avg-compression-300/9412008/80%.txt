 The probabilistic measure cv1 provides better accuracy than the mutual information measure cv2 for five kanzi character compound nouns, but the result is reversed for six kanzi character compound nouns The results for four kanzi character words are almost equal We could not obtain correct segmentation for 11 out of 954 cases for four kanzi character words, 39 out of 710 cases for five kanzi character words, and 15 out of 787 cases for six kanzi character words There are 11 such cases for four kanzi character words, 35 such cases for five kanzi character words, and 29 cases for six kanzi character words Since a compound noun of our test data consists of four, five, and six characters, there could be cases with a compound noun consisting of four, five, or six words We propose a method to analyze Japanese compound nouns using collocational information and a thesaurus We also describe a method to acquire the collocational information from a corpus of four kanzi character words2 characters They assumed compound nouns consist of only one character words and two character words In this paper, we propose a method to analyze structures of Japanese compound nouns by using word collocational information and a thesaurus The collocational information is acquired from a corpus of four kanzi character words Besides the word collocations information, we also use semantic knowledge, namely, a thesaurus This section describes procedures to acquire collocational information for analyzing compound nouns from a corpus of four kanzi character words We use collocations from thesaurus categories that are word abstractions collect four kanzi character words (section ) 2 divide the above words in the middle to produce pairs of two kanzi character words; if one is not in the thesaurus, this four kanzi character word is discarded (section ) 3 assign thesaurus categories to both two kanzi character word (section ) 4 count occurrence frequencies of category collocations (section ) We use a corpus of four kanzi character words as the knowledge source of collocational information The reasons are as follows: In Japanese, kanzi character sequences longer than three are usually compound nouns, This tendency is confirmed by comparing the occurrence frequencies of kanzi character words in texts and those headwords in dictionaries Therefore a collection of four kanzi character words would be used as a corpus of compound nouns Four kanzi character sequences are useful to extract binary relations of nouns, because dividing a four kanzi character sequence in the middle often gives correct segmentation There is a fairly large corpus of four kanzi character words created by Prof After collecting word collocations, we must assign a thesaurus category to each word use word collocations with all words is assigned a single category Word collocations containing words with multiple categories represent about 1/3 of the corpus After assigning the thesaurus categories to words, we count occurrence frequencies of category collocations as follows: 1 replace thesaurus categories with words to produce category collocation patterns 3 assign thesaurus categories to all words 3 For example, the preference of structure 118, 311 137] is calculated as follows: We extract kanzi character sequences from newspaper editorials and columns and encyclopedia text, which has no overlap with the training corpus: 954 compound nouns consisting of four kanzi characters, 710 compound nouns consisting of five kanzi characters, and 786 compound nouns consisting of six kanzi characters are manually extracted from the set of the above kanzi character sequences These three collections of compound nouns are used for test data
