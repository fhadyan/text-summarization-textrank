 The probabilistic measure cv1 provides better accuracy than the mutual information measure cv2 for five kanzi character compound nouns, but the result is reversed for six kanzi character compound nouns The results for four kanzi character words are almost equal We could not obtain correct segmentation for 11 out of 954 cases for four kanzi character words, 39 out of 710 cases for five kanzi character words, and 15 out of 787 cases for six kanzi character words There are 11 such cases for four kanzi character words, 35 such cases for five kanzi character words, and 29 cases for six kanzi character words We propose a method to analyze Japanese compound nouns using collocational information and a thesaurus We also describe a method to acquire the collocational information from a corpus of four kanzi character words They assumed compound nouns consist of only one character words and two character words The collocational information is acquired from a corpus of four kanzi character words This section describes procedures to acquire collocational information for analyzing compound nouns from a corpus of four kanzi character words collect four kanzi character words (section ) 2 assign thesaurus categories to both two kanzi character word (section ) 4 count occurrence frequencies of category collocations (section ) We use a corpus of four kanzi character words as the knowledge source of collocational information Therefore a collection of four kanzi character words would be used as a corpus of compound nouns There is a fairly large corpus of four kanzi character words created by Prof use word collocations with all words is assigned a single category Word collocations containing words with multiple categories represent about 1/3 of the corpus replace thesaurus categories with words to produce category collocation patterns 3 assign thesaurus categories to all words 3
