 One way to do this is to let the right context vector record which classes of left context vectors occur to the right of a word The rationale is that words with similar left context characterize words to their right in a similar way Generalized left context vectors were derived by an analogous procedure using word-based right context vectors the black cat vs We refer to the vector of left neighbors of a word as its left context vector, and to the vector of right neighbors as its right context vector The left and right context vectors are the basis for four different tag induction experiments, which are described in detail below: induction based on word type only induction based on word type and context induction based on word type and context, restricted to natural contexts induction based on word type and context, using generalized left and right context vectors The two context vectors of a word characterize the distribution of neighboring words to its left and right An occurrence of word w is represented by a concatenation of four context vectors: The right context vector of the preceding word The left context vector of w The right context vector of w The left context vector of the following word
