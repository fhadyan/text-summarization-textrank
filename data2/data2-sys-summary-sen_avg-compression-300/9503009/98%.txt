 The rationale is that words with similar left context characterize words to their right in a similar way Generalized left context vectors were derived by an analogous procedure using word-based right context vectors the black cat vs We refer to the vector of left neighbors of a word as its left context vector, and to the vector of right neighbors as its right context vector The left context vector of w The right context vector of w The left context vector of the following word
