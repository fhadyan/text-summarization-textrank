 agr is a closed feature that can take only a feature structure as its value, and some restrictions are declared over its possible feature components: gender and number, or number and person In this section of the Source Lexical Base, rules are given for building the Object Dictionary The rules in each subsection will be applied to the entries defined in the relevant section of the Source Lexical Base The left hand side refers to the entry generated in the Object Dictionary and the right hand side to the entry under consideration in the Source Lexical Base Inheritance can be prohibited in a particular feature for selected irregular or special entries, just by assigning a value to that feature This design leads towards considering two different lexical levels: Source Lexical Base: This level captures linguistic generalizations by merging related allomorph entries, by considering classes of lemmas or by specifying rules to compute different allomorphic variants Object Dictionary: This level is related to the computer processing of the lexical knowledge included in the Lexical Base It is automatically derived from the Source Lexical Base We use the term EN (Entry Name) for the label and ES (Entry Structure) for the attached feature structure Most entries in the Source Lexical Base are lemmas grouping related word forms The main characteristics of the Source Lexical Base representation language are described in this section The ES has a number of labeled features, that can have an atomic value -a label assigned to that feature or a structured one -another feature structure The Source Lexical Base is split into sections, each one headed by a special keyword Versatility: Different implemented applications have different lexical interfaces, that are designed in a programming language dependent way These always happen as the value for a particular feature, and the value returned by the rule is assigned to such feature
