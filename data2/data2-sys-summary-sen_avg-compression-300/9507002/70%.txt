 agr is a closed feature that can take only a feature structure as its value, and some restrictions are declared over its possible feature components: gender and number, or number and person This section is of special interest for consistency checking over the whole source lexical base, for detecting misspellings of feature names and values, and as reference for lexicographer editors In this section of the Source Lexical Base, rules are given for building the Object Dictionary The section specifies a set of rules for each of the sections containing lexical entries (lemmas, words and morphemes  The rules in each subsection will be applied to the entries defined in the relevant section of the Source Lexical Base For each rule succesfully applied, a new entry will be generated in the Object Dictionary The left hand side refers to the entry generated in the Object Dictionary and the right hand side to the entry under consideration in the Source Lexical Base The Spanish language strongly relies on morphology for word formation For each possible allomorph that can be included in a lemma entry, a rule should be included in this section This is particularly true for verbs, which have a different word form for each different combination of mood, tense, person and number Nouns and adjectives (nominals) have also different forms, depending of the combination chosen of gender and number, so a maximum of four different word forms are needed for these part-of-speech lemmas Feature unification is the information combining device used to select the relevant allomorphic variants to be concatenated Allomorphs have an attached feature structure DAG, and two or more of them are concatenated only if their feature structures are validated by context-free word formation rules Linguistic generalizations are captured by grouping related entries in lemmas, or by using the mechanism of information inheritance Inheritance can be prohibited in a particular feature for selected irregular or special entries, just by assigning a value to that feature This design leads towards considering two different lexical levels: Source Lexical Base: This level captures linguistic generalizations by merging related allomorph entries, by considering classes of lemmas or by specifying rules to compute different allomorphic variants Inflectional morphemes -that constitute a closed group- are also included, as well as the set of lexicalized word forms Object Dictionary: This level is related to the computer processing of the lexical knowledge included in the Lexical Base To facilitate such process, the lexical entries are expanded to different allomorphs that constitute the key entries in this level It is automatically derived from the Source Lexical Base An entry, at any of the levels, is composed of a name or label, that constitutes the access key for that entry, and an attached feature structure We use the term EN (Entry Name) for the label and ES (Entry Structure) for the attached feature structure Most entries in the Source Lexical Base are lemmas grouping related word forms The information related to a lemma is structured in a tree-shaped feature bundle attached to it As each one can have different surface realizations, the relevant allomorphs are included as values of particular features in the ES attached to the label In the Object Dictionary, the roles of lemma identifiers and allomorphs are different, since for each entry, the EN is one of the allomorphic variants, and the lemma label is kept as the value of a particular feature included in its attached ES This paper is concerned with the representation language selected for the Source Lexical Level, that also includes rules for expressing how the mapping to the Object Dictionary will be achieved The main characteristics of the Source Lexical Base representation language are described in this section As we stated above, each entry in this Source Lexical Base, is composed of an EN, or label, and a ES, or feature structure, restricted to be a tree The ES has a number of labeled features, that can have an atomic value -a label assigned to that feature or a structured one -another feature structure As a particular case, a string of characters can be encoded as an atomic value for a feature The vi are the atomic values that this particular feature can have The Source Lexical Base is split into sections, each one headed by a special keyword An include facility is also provided in order to promote physical division of the Lexical Base into different computer files The sections that can appear in the Source Lexical Base are reviewed below The entries in this section will also pass almost unchanged to the Object Dictionary Versatility: Different implemented applications have different lexical interfaces, that are designed in a programming language dependent way A class definition is a label (EN) and a feature structure (ES) attached to it Rule invocation, however, is made when a particular child entry from that class is processed Each lemma will be expanded to different entries when the Object Dictionary is compiled We show a very simple example, that extensively uses the inheritance mechanism: Allomorphy rules are declared in a separate section, and are designed to build particular allomorphs for a given lemma entry Rule invocation is usually done in a class definition, although it can be done in a particular entry in the lemmas section These always happen as the value for a particular feature, and the value returned by the rule is assigned to such feature If there is no successful match, the rule fails and neither value is returned nor assigned to the feature that invoqued the rule
