 In this section of the Source Lexical Base, rules are given for building the Object Dictionary Inheritance can be prohibited in a particular feature for selected irregular or special entries, just by assigning a value to that feature This design leads towards considering two different lexical levels: Source Lexical Base: This level captures linguistic generalizations by merging related allomorph entries, by considering classes of lemmas or by specifying rules to compute different allomorphic variants Object Dictionary: This level is related to the computer processing of the lexical knowledge included in the Lexical Base We use the term EN (Entry Name) for the label and ES (Entry Structure) for the attached feature structure Most entries in the Source Lexical Base are lemmas grouping related word forms These always happen as the value for a particular feature, and the value returned by the rule is assigned to such feature Rule application is a pattern-matching process
