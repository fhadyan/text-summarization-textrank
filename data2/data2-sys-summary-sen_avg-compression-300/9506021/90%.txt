 An iterative, unsupervised method was then used to decide between noun and verb attachment for each triple The decision was made as follows: If then choose noun attachment, else choose verb attachment The test used in can then be stated as follows in our notation: If then choose noun attachment, else choose verb attachment In particular, quadruples and triples seen in test data will frequently be seen only once or twice in training data The training and test data were both the unprocessed, original data sets `Always noun attachment' means attach to the noun regardless of (v,n1,p,n2  `Most likely for each preposition' means use the attachment seen most often in training data for the preposition seen in the test quadruple A maximum likelihood method would use the training data to give the following estimation for the conditional probability: Unfortunately sparse data problems make this estimate useless A quadruple may appear in test data which has never been seen in training data The attachment decisions for these triples were unknown, so an unsupervised training method was used (section 5 use 12,000 training and 500 test examples (Typical examples would be `If P=of then choose noun attachment' or `If V=buy and P=for choose verb attachment 9% on the IBM data used in this paper use the data described in section 2 For example (P=of) might have a strong weight for noun attachment, while (V=buy,P=for) would have a strong weight for verb attachment For each such VP the head verb, first head noun, preposition and second head noun were extracted, along with the attachment decision (1 for noun attachment, 0 for verb  Section 6 Else (default is noun attachment  The decision is then: If choose noun attachment
