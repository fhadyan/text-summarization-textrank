 Several methods to capture segment boundaries have been proposed in the studies of text structure Youmans (1991) proposed VMP (vocabulary management profile) as an indicator of segment boundaries One of the constituents of the text structure is a text segment001041  LCP of the text is a sequence of lexical cohesiveness c(Si  LCP treats the text T as a word list without any punctuation or paragraph boundaries Correlation between LCP and text segments This paper proposes an indicator, called the lexical cohesion profile (LCP which locates segment boundaries in a narrative text This section inspects the correlation between LCP and segment boundaries perceived by the human judgments The solid bars represent the histogram of segment boundaries reported by 16 subjects who read the text without paragraph structure LCP is a record of lexical cohesiveness of words in a sequence of text It is clear that the valleys of the LCP correspond mostly to the dominant segment boundaries Note that LCP can detect segment changing of a text regardless of its paragraph structure For example, is a paragraph boundary, but neither a valley of the LCP nor a segment boundary; is both a segment boundary and approximately a valley of the LCP, but not a paragraph boundary However, some valleys of the LCP do not exactly correspond to segment boundaries This paper proposed LCP, an indicator of segment changing, which concentrates on lexical cohesion of a text segment Text segmentation described here provides basic information for text understanding: Resolving anaphora and ellipsis: Segment boundaries provide valuable restriction for determination of the referents Analyzing text structure: Segment boundaries can be considered as segment switching (push and pop) in hierarchical structure of text
