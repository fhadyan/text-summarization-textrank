 A text is not just a sequence of words, but it has coherent structure Several methods to capture segment boundaries have been proposed in the studies of text structure Youmans (1991) proposed VMP (vocabulary management profile) as an indicator of segment boundaries Recognizing the structure of text is an essential task in text understanding, especially in resolving anaphora and ellipsis One of the constituents of the text structure is a text segment001041  LCP of the text is a sequence of lexical cohesiveness c(Si  LCP treats the text T as a word list without any punctuation or paragraph boundaries Figure 2 Correlation between LCP and text segments A graph of LCP, which plots c(Si) at the text position i, indicates changing of segments: If Si is inside a segment, it tends to be cohesive and makes c(Si) high As shown in Figure 2, the segment boundaries can be detected by the valleys (minimum points) of LCP This paper proposes an indicator, called the lexical cohesion profile (LCP which locates segment boundaries in a narrative text This section inspects the correlation between LCP and segment boundaries perceived by the human judgments The solid bars represent the histogram of segment boundaries reported by 16 subjects who read the text without paragraph structure LCP is a record of lexical cohesiveness of words in a sequence of text It is clear that the valleys of the LCP correspond mostly to the dominant segment boundaries Note that LCP can detect segment changing of a text regardless of its paragraph structure For example, is a paragraph boundary, but neither a valley of the LCP nor a segment boundary; is both a segment boundary and approximately a valley of the LCP, but not a paragraph boundary However, some valleys of the LCP do not exactly correspond to segment boundaries For example, the valley near disagree with the segment boundary at  This paper proposed LCP, an indicator of segment changing, which concentrates on lexical cohesion of a text segment The experiment proved that LCP closely correlate with the segment boundaries captured by the human judgments, and that lexical cohesion plays main role in forming a sequence of words into segments Text segmentation described here provides basic information for text understanding: Resolving anaphora and ellipsis: Segment boundaries provide valuable restriction for determination of the referents Analyzing text structure: Segment boundaries can be considered as segment switching (push and pop) in hierarchical structure of text The segmentation can be applied also to text summarizing
