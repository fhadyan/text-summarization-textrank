 A robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) system must be able to process sentences that contain words unknown to its lexicon The syntactic and semantic properties of unknown words are derived from those of known words in a sentence, assuming that the given sentence is valid Otherwise, constraints are inferred for unknown words that will make the sentence valid Unknown words have been semantically classified using knowledge intensive methods , ,  This approach assumes that the sentences with known words produce parse trees that will match or cover all of the sentences with unknown words This makes maximal use of the constraints of known words and reduces the search space for determining the properties of unknown words We describe the process of acquiring the syntax of unknown words and outline the process of semantic acquisition Syntactic acquisition is the process of mapping an unknown word to a finite set of syntactic categories Given a sentence with unknown words the disjuncts of unknown words are determined based upon the syntactic constraints of the known words in the sentence For instance suppose that snipe is an unknown word in the sentence: The snipe eats meat  The lexicon of known words and any phrase structure rules that exist determine the size of the search space for the classification of unknown words The next word considered is `eats  All constraints on the usage of words are integrated into the lexicon In their work Lexical Acquisition consists of mapping an unknown word into a known sequence of events Suppose that the following sentences with no unknown words have been processed S2: The condor eats meat While the lexicon has no information about the unknown word it does have the semantic constraints of the known words in the sentence
