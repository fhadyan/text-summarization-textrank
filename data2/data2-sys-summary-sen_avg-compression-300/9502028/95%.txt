 The syntactic and semantic properties of unknown words are derived from those of known words in a sentence, assuming that the given sentence is valid Otherwise, constraints are inferred for unknown words that will make the sentence valid This makes maximal use of the constraints of known words and reduces the search space for determining the properties of unknown words Given a sentence with unknown words the disjuncts of unknown words are determined based upon the syntactic constraints of the known words in the sentence For instance suppose that snipe is an unknown word in the sentence: The snipe eats meat  Suppose that the following sentences with no unknown words have been processed S2: The condor eats meat While the lexicon has no information about the unknown word it does have the semantic constraints of the known words in the sentence
