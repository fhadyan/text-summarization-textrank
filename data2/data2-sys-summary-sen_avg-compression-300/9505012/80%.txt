 The set of original terms is ignored although it could be a useful source of knowledge for acquisition sunflower seed] oil  It is possible to conceive a finer approach to term acquisition by considering the local variants of terms within corpora As stated for coordination, iteration of acquisition on candidates terms yields conceptual classes As term variants generally involve more than one term, their extraction can fruitfully exploit existing lists of terms in a process of non massive incremental acquisition It takes fifteen cycles to complete an acquisition of 5,080 terms when starting from the 71,623 terms of the [Pascal] list Table shows five sequences of acquisition obtained from term variants in [Medic] starting from a reference term in [Pascal  When not using permutation, the acquisition process yields smaller sets of terms : it produces 2,998 terms in fourteen steps through coordinations and insertions, 2,193 terms in seven steps through insertions and 357 terms in six steps through coordinations For example, if viral hepatitis is a known term, viral and autoimmune hepatitis is a variant of this term (a coordination) which displays autoimmune hepatitis as a candidate term As our method is based on the observation of rare occurrences, the number of acquired terms depends on the set of reference terms Figure exemplifies acquisition curves for different values of the volume of reference terms It shows that the size of the acquisition gradually degrades when the size of the bootstrap decreases : 5,080 terms are acquired when starting from the total list of 12,717 terms, 3,833 terms are still acquired from a bootstrap of 6,000 terms and 2,329 terms from a bootstrap of 1,000 terms The main feature of our approach is accounting for existing lists of terms by observing their variants and yielding conceptual links as well as candidate terms Henceforth, potential terms acquired through acquisition techniques will be called candidate terms Tools for acquiring terms generally operate on large corpora using various techniques to detect term occurrences For example, LEXTER extracts 20,000 occurrences from a 200,000-word corpus which represent 10,000 candidate terms In order to reduce the volume of acquisition and also to propose candidates which are more likely to be terms, this paper presents a method based on an initial list of terms called reference terms The acquisition procedure starts from this supposed comprehensive set of reference terms It decomposes variations of these terms found in corpora and is then able to detect candidate terms Our approach also differs from previous experiments on term acquisition because it yields conceptual links between candidate and reference terms The first step in our approach to terminological acquisition is the extraction of term variants from a large corpus FASTR recycles lists of reference terms by transforming them into grammar rules Then, it dynamically builds term variant rules from these term rules Currently, the meta-grammar of FASTR for English includes 73 meta-rules for 2- and 3-word terms : 25 coordination meta-rules, 17 insertion meta-rules and 31 permutation meta-rules (plus 66 meta-rules for 4-word terms which are not used for acquisition  The acquisition of terms by extracting patterns from variants is processed as follows for the different categories of variants : Coordination The candidate term is the term coordinated with the original one Insertion The candidate term is the term which has replaced the head of the original term through substitution Permutation The candidate term is the noun phrase inside this prepositional phrase This method for term acquisition does not systematically succeed for each encountered term variant Moreover, terms acquired through a variation may already be reference terms (see the non-underlined candidates in Tables  Moreover, acquisitions of known terms are not useless because they reveal conceptual links between these terms On the contrary, coordination and insertion variations relate semantically close terms Two terms are coordinated only if they share the same semantic scheme Our acquisition is restricted to local selection but takes advantage of the pre-existing knowledge embodied in lists of reference terms Acquired terms are neither conceptually nor linguistically related to the original ones The acquisition from variants, illustrated for one step in Table , is repeated on candidate terms as long as new candidates are discovered These two terms are the most generic ones
