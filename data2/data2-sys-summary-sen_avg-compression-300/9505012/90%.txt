 It is possible to conceive a finer approach to term acquisition by considering the local variants of terms within corpora As stated for coordination, iteration of acquisition on candidates terms yields conceptual classes As term variants generally involve more than one term, their extraction can fruitfully exploit existing lists of terms in a process of non massive incremental acquisition It takes fifteen cycles to complete an acquisition of 5,080 terms when starting from the 71,623 terms of the [Pascal] list When not using permutation, the acquisition process yields smaller sets of terms : it produces 2,998 terms in fourteen steps through coordinations and insertions, 2,193 terms in seven steps through insertions and 357 terms in six steps through coordinations Figure exemplifies acquisition curves for different values of the volume of reference terms It shows that the size of the acquisition gradually degrades when the size of the bootstrap decreases : 5,080 terms are acquired when starting from the total list of 12,717 terms, 3,833 terms are still acquired from a bootstrap of 6,000 terms and 2,329 terms from a bootstrap of 1,000 terms Henceforth, potential terms acquired through acquisition techniques will be called candidate terms The acquisition procedure starts from this supposed comprehensive set of reference terms It decomposes variations of these terms found in corpora and is then able to detect candidate terms Our approach also differs from previous experiments on term acquisition because it yields conceptual links between candidate and reference terms Then, it dynamically builds term variant rules from these term rules The candidate term is the term coordinated with the original one Insertion The candidate term is the term which has replaced the head of the original term through substitution Permutation This method for term acquisition does not systematically succeed for each encountered term variant Moreover, terms acquired through a variation may already be reference terms (see the non-underlined candidates in Tables  Moreover, acquisitions of known terms are not useless because they reveal conceptual links between these terms On the contrary, coordination and insertion variations relate semantically close terms These two terms are the most generic ones
