 The resulting DCG, FSA pair for the example PCP is given in figure : The question whether the intersection of a FSA and an off-line parsable DCG is empty is undecidable For any threshold it is the case that the intersection problem of off-line parsable DCGs and FSA is decidable Then we compute the intersection of the skeleton with the input FSA This results in a parse forest grammar Finally, we add the corresponding constraints from the DCG to the grammar rules of the parse forest grammar Such a grammar might be called the parse-forest grammar Parsing uncertain input might be necessary in case of ill-formed textual input, or in case of speech input The predicate side_effect is used to construct the parse forest grammar FSA of course generalizes such word lattices if the intersection is empty we want an empty parse-forest grammar figure  This FSA generates x
