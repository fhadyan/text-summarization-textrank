 When utterances had more than one correct reading, a preference heuristic was used to select the most plausible one The coverage loss due to grammar specialization was then measured on the 1,000 utterance test set The specialized grammar used the New scheme, and had been trained on the full training set After each level, constituent pruning is used to eliminate unlikely constituents Given a sufficiently large corpus parsed by the original, general, grammar, it is possible to identify the common combinations of grammar rules and chunk them into macro-rules  The coverage of the specialized grammar is a strict subset of that of the original grammar; thus any analysis produced by the specialized grammar is guaranteed to be valid in the original one as well The practical utility of the specialized grammar is largely determined by the loss of coverage incurred by the specialization process The two methods, constituent pruning and grammar specialization, are combined as follows The rules in the original, general, grammar are divided into two sets, called phrasal and non-phrasal respectively Parsing proceeds by interleaving constituent creation and deletion First, the lexicon and morphology rules are used to hypothesize word analyses Constituent pruning then removes all sufficiently unlikely edges Finally, the specialized grammar is used to search for full parses Section describes the constituent pruning method Phrasal parsing then creates a number of new edges, including one for flight D L three one two as a noun phrase As a result, full parsing is very quick, and only one analysis (the correct one) is produced for the sentence One possible solution is of course to dispense with the idea of using a general grammar, and simply code a new grammar for each domain This pruning is fully interleaved with the parsing process As described in Section above, the non-phrasal grammar rules are subjected to two phases of processing Most simply, there is the size of the training corpus; a larger training corpus means a smaller loss of coverage due to grammar specialization (Recall that grammar specialization in general trades coverage for speed  In both cases, the coverage loss due to grammar specialization was about 10 to 12% using training corpora with about 5,000 examples Note that only the non-phrasal rules are used as input to the chunks from which the specialized grammar rules are constructed
