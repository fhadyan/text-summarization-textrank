 Two sets of experiments were performed The coverage loss due to grammar specialization was then measured on the 1,000 utterance test set The specialized grammar used the New scheme, and had been trained on the full training set After each level, constituent pruning is used to eliminate unlikely constituents The coverage of the specialized grammar is a strict subset of that of the original grammar; thus any analysis produced by the specialized grammar is guaranteed to be valid in the original one as well The two methods, constituent pruning and grammar specialization, are combined as follows Constituent pruning then removes all sufficiently unlikely edges Finally, the specialized grammar is used to search for full parses Section describes the constituent pruning method One possible solution is of course to dispense with the idea of using a general grammar, and simply code a new grammar for each domain As described in Section above, the non-phrasal grammar rules are subjected to two phases of processing Most simply, there is the size of the training corpus; a larger training corpus means a smaller loss of coverage due to grammar specialization (Recall that grammar specialization in general trades coverage for speed
