 The supposition of an intentional structure explains how discourse coherence is preserved in the absence of a complete history of the discourse Rather, discourse participants summarize the verbatim contents of a discourse segment by the discourse intention it satisfies Thus, I expected to find in my discourse samples the following correlations: Unfilled pause duration and focusing operation are correlated Cue phrases are correlated with focusing operations The discourse intention of greatest scope is the Discourse Purpose (DP the reason for initiating a discourse2 Cue phrase type and unfilled pause duration are correlated as well Within this, discourse segments are introduced to fulfill a particular Discourse Segment Purpose (DSP) and thereby contribute to the satisfaction of the overall DP I analyzed two discourse samples three minutes of a directions discourse and seven minutes of a manager-employee project meeting campus The search for correlations among cue phrases, unfilled pauses and discourse structure generated three data collection tasks: Identification of cue phrases; Identification and measurement of unfilled pauses; Segmentation of the discourse via the identification of the focusing operations that effected the segmentation Attentional cues are especially important because topical relations do not always predict discourse structure In such discourse, domain and attentional hierarchies often coincide the relations among segments and of each segment to the overall Discourse Purpose are clear In prepared discourse (written or spoken) the intentional structure is tightly coupled to the Discourse Purpose This recommends against reliance on domain knowledge, since one discourse may invoke more than one domaine current context) changes only from segment to segment The co-occurring focusing operation The segmentation described a discourse with two top level segments In particular, the attentional state describes the processing of the discourse segment which has been introduced to satisfy the current discourse intention13 seconds 58, p =  For each focusing operation, the difference between mean pause durations at best only approaches significance (see Table [24  One account emphasizes the processes involved in choosing and communicating the state of global focus It is because of their interdependence and synchrony that I can postulate the hypothesis that co-occurring linguistic and attentional phenomena in spoken discourse cue phrases, pauses and discourse structure and processing are linked The minimal cue in this regard is the filled pause Cue phrases serve not only the listener but also the speaker These are the focus space and the focus space stack If borne out, they can be re-fashioned as characterizations of the circumstances in which cue phrases and unfilled pauses are most likely to be used The relationships among cue phrases, unfilled pauses and the structuring of discourse are investigated within the paradigm of the tripartite model of discourse The focus space is the computational representation of processing in the current context, that is, for the discourse segment currently under construction Especially, the difficulty of utterance production might be explained by the complexity of the co-occurring focusing operation In addition, the aptness of the tripartite model itself is not assured A focus space lives on a pushdown stack called the focus space stack Thus, it treats the emerging discourse structure and the changing attentional foci as publicly accessible properties of the discourse The theory of the tripartite nature of discourse frames my hypotheses about the correlation of cue phrases, pause duration and discourse structure Changes to the attentional state occur at segment boundaries The correlation of unfilled pauses with attentional state is less certain because pauses appear at all levels of discourse structure The linking of pause duration to the processing of discourse segments motivates some auxiliary hypotheses that refine notions about the kinds of mental operations sanctioned by the focus space model and about the internal structure of a discourse segment In the theory of discourse structure, changes to the attentional state are modeled as operations on the focus space stack To explain the organization of a discourse into topics and subtopics, Grosz and Sidner postulate three interrelated components of discourse a linguistic structure, an intentional structure and an attentional state GROSZ-SIDNER  In the linguistic structure, the linear sequence of utterances becomes hierarchical utterances aggregate into discourse segments, and the discourse segments are organized hierarchically according to the relations among the purposes or discourse intentions that each satisfies The relations among discourse intentions are captured in the intentional structure The study of cue phrases and their correlation with discourse structure and focus of attention is most extensive for the discourse marker SCHIFFRIN subcategory
