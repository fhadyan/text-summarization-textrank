 From Johnson's work, we see that combining problems may change the complexity from decidable to undecidable Finally, this A derives in csteps By fact , where  Lemma proves that this reduction f is computable in polynomial time Lemma 4 The second check is performed by the algorithm FEATUREGRAPHSAT from Section  Clearly, both checks only take polynomial time For instance, let problem A be the complement of problem B In some specific situations, however, these reductions do not exist Consider for instance the class of grammars that generate a finite language So, there may be many blurred restrictions on the unification In this paper, we have assessed the complexity results of formalizations that intend to describe feature theories in computational linguistics
