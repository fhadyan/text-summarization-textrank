 The second is that the nonmonotonic unification operation used is order independent Compared with Reiter's default logic, our notion of nonmonotonic sorts corresponds to default theories Unification of nonmonotonic sorts would then correspond to merging two default theories into one single theory and our notion of explaining a nonmonotonic sort corresponds to computing the extension of a default theory in default logic The restriction in our nonmonotonic rules that is similar to the restriction into normal default rules and captures the important property, that the application of one nonmonotonic rule should not affect the applicability of previously applied rules One difference is that nonmonotonic sorts allow that the application of a nonmonotonic rule leads to fail, i The two following examples will illustrate the difference between nonmonotonic rules giving multiple extensions and nonmonotonic rules giving a single explanation fail Note that even though there is an order dependency on the application order of nonmonotonic rules this does not affect the order independency on nonmonotonic unification between application of nonmonotonic rules Considering unification of nonmonotonic sorts it is not necessary to simplify the nonmonotonic part of the resulting sort As stated previously, nonmonotonic sorts allow multiple explanations of a nonmonotonic sort However, if this definition is to be really useful we must also allow one definition of a nonmonotonic rule to make use of other nonmonotonic rules However, this generalization is outside default logic It is, however, very useful when defining nonmonotonic constructions These requirements can be both structures in the subsumption order and nonmonotonic rules In this section I provide give the formal definitions for nonmonotonic sorts and how nonmonotonic sorts are unified and explained As seen by the definition a nonmonotonic sort is considered to be a pair of monotonic information from the subsumption order and nonmonotonic information represented as a set of nonmonotonic rules The user can assign nonmonotonic information to a nonmonotonic sort by calling a nonmonotonic definition as defined in the previous section The last condition on a nonmonotonic sort, , may seem superfluous Given the unification operation of objects within the subsumption order and the definition of nonmonotonic sorts it is possible to define an operation for nonmonotonic unification Definition 2 The nonmonotonic unification ( ) of two nonmonotonic sorts and is the sort where and The nonmonotonic unification is computed by computing the unification of the monotonic parts of the two sorts and then taking the union of their nonmonotonic parts When using nonmonotonic sorts containing nonmonotonic rules, we also need to know how to merge the monotonic and nonmonotonic information within the sort
