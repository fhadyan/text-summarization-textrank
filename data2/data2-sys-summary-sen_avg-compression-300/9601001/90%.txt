 The acquired DATR theory is depicted graphically in Fig An inheritance descriptor can refer to another node, path or node-path pair of the theory The simple DATR theory in Fig a simple DATR theory VERB: [mor past] ( [mor root] _ed) \t\t \t\t [mor pres tense] [mor root] \t\t \t\t [mor pres tense sing three] ( [mor root] _s  The information expressed in a DATR theory is accessed by queries concerning objects and their properties The learning task then consists in forming a DATR theory which accounts for the observed facts through adequate structuring A DATR theory is consistent with respect to a given set of extensional sentences if, for every query that constitutes the left-hand side of one of the extensional sentences, the returned value is that of the extensional sentence The inferred DATR theory should structure the observed data so that it reveals relationships that exist between the extensional sentences A DATR theory expresses such relationships by the use of inheritance descriptors For example, the sentence VERB mor past] ( [mor root] _ed) of the theory in Fig The observed data constitute a trivial DATR theory which forms the initial hypothesis H0 of the learning task Since inheritance descriptors are stated as right-hand sides (RHS) or parts of RHSs of sentences, the transformation rules operate on RHSs of DATR sentences Corresponding to the different kinds of inheritance relationships that can be expressed in a DATR theory, there are four major groups of transformation rules: rules that return sentences with local descriptors (local paths, local nodes, local node-path pairs rules that transform sentences into others that have a global descriptor, rules where the transformed sentence contains a descriptor that refers to a sentence with a global descriptor, and rules that create new, abstract sentences for the acquisition of a hierarchy Theoretical approaches and implemented systems cover subjects from many different linguistic areas and use different kinds of learning strategies
