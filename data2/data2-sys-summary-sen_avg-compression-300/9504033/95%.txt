0) is used to favour a left-branching analysis Eight different training schemes have been used to estimate the parameters and each set of estimates used to analyse the test set under both the adjacency and the dependency model One problem with the training methods given in section is the restriction of training data to nouns in  Three training schemes have been used and the tuned analysis procedures applied to the test set While Hindle and Rooth (1993) use a partial parser to acquire training data, such machinery appears unnecessary for noun compounds Resnik (1993) used unambiguous noun compounds from the parsed Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus to estimate the association values and analysed a test set of around 160 compounds This renders their experiment inconclusive The remaining compounds were assigned either a left-branching or right-branching analysis One problem with applying lexical association to noun compounds is the enormous number of parameters required, one for every possible pair of nouns To ensure that the test set is disjoint from the training data, all occurrences of the test noun compounds have been removed from the training corpus
