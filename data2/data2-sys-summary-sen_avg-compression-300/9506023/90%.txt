 Scientific discovery was one of the favourite topics of Renaissance scholars (F Mill's methods for induction are introduced, and a system incorporating these methods is described, using as illustrations a simple deciphering problem and the discovery of (a part of) the famous Germanic Consonant Shift, known as Grimm's Law MILL's data representation is a simple Object-Attribute-Value knowledge structure Its discovery process is, in essence, an attempt to apply one or more of the above methods The study of discovery in linguistics is not fashionable today Thus, some methods (e MA a discovery using both (i Now we may look briefly at the discovery process Finally, although we have considered only linguistic discovery, the system may be, obviously, applied to discovering empirical regularities in other fields as well In his influential book Syntactic Structures Chomsky made a devastating criticism of descriptivists' discovery procedures, totally shifting the focus on grammar justification Very significant contributions to a general understanding of the discovery process have come from various scientific disciplines, incl Another major factor contributing to the neglect of the study of discovery issues in linguistics is a view which may be called naive inductivism  In effect, in many disciplines to date discovery is considered quite a respectable object of investigation And, in the second place, any (linguistic) discovery, contrary to the tenet discussed, is as a rule empirically underdetermined Botha 1980 who devotes a whole chapter to a (philosophically-oriented) treatment of linguistic discovery  also Pericliev 1990) where some heuristics are illustrated with a real research problem; a book on linguistic discovery is under preparation  Mill (Mill 1879) formulated several methods canons for discovery of causally related facts in a set of instances (observations  Then, the heursitics are provided with somewhat simplistic linguistic examples, and their implications for the computational modeling of (linguistic) discovery are briefly discussed So they have been widely used in the process of linguistic inquiry Their use may be unconscious (often disguised as specific litmus) tests discovery procedures etc in fact directly based on Mill's canons or it may be conscious (e Psychological plausibility is a further feature which a discovery system may profitably possess
