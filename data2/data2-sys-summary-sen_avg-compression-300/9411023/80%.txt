 We have developed an automatic abstract generation system for Japanese expository writings based on rhetorical structure extraction The system first extracts the rhetorical structure, the compound of the rhetorical relations between sentences, and then cuts out less important parts in the extracted structure to generate an abstract of the desired length Therefore, they lack linguistic clues and the system cannot extract the rhetorical structure exactly We have developed an automatic abstract generation system for Japanese expository writings based on rhetorical structure extraction The rhetorical structure provides a natural order of importance among sentences in the text, and can be used to determine which sentence should be extracted in the abstract, according to the desired length of the abstract The rhetorical structure also provides the rhetorical relation between the extracted sentences, and can be used to generate appropriate connectives between them Abstract generation based on rhetorical structure extraction has four merits First, unlike conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems(e The limitations of the system are mainly due to errors in the rhetorical structure analysis and the sentence-selection-type abstract generation In our model, discourse structure[ is defined as the rhetorical structure, ie the compound of rhetorical relations between sentences in text Abstract generation is realized as a suitable application of the extracted rhetorical structure Rhetorical structure represents relations between various chunks of sentences in the body of each section An intra-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation units are sentences, and an inter-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation units are paragraphs The relations exemplified in Table are used for representing the rhetorical structure The rhetorical structure represents logical relations between sentences or blocks of sentences of each section of the document A rhetorical structure analysis determines logical relations between sentences based on linguistic clues, such as connectives, anaphoric expressions, and idiomatic expressions in the input text, and then recognizes an argumentative chunk of sentences Rhetorical structure extraction consists of five major sub-processes: (1) Sentence analysis accomplishes morphological and syntactic analysis for each sentence (2) Rhetorical relation extraction detects rhetorical relations and constructs the sequence of sentence identifiers and relations (3) Segmentation detects rhetorical expressions between distant sentences which define rhetorical structure For example, for the text in Fig The system generates the abstract of each section of the document by examining its rhetorical structure (1) Sentence evaluation (2) Structure reduction In the sentence evaluation stage, the system calculate the importance of each sentence in the original text based on the relative importance of rhetorical relations If the text is written loosely, the rhetorical structure generally contains many BothNucleus relations (e The figure shows that sentence four and five have penalty score three, that sentence three has two , that sentence one and two have one, and that sentence six has no penalty score For example, in the abstract generation mentioned above, sentence two does not appear solely in the abstract, but appears always with sentence one If sentence two appeared alone in the abstract without sentence one, it would be difficult to understand the text
