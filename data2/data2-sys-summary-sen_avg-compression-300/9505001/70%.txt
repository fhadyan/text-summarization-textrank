s-attack  _beli Thus the algorithm first considers whether or not attacking the user's support for _bel is sufficient to convince him of _bel (step e _belifocus is not nil focus) will be the union of the focus for each of the beliefs in this minimum subset If providing evidence directly against _bel is predicted to be successful, then the focus of modification is _bel itself (step  If directly attacking _bel is also predicted to fail, the algorithm considers the effect of attacking both _bel and its unaccepted proposed evidence by combining the previous two prediction processes (step  If the combined evidence is still predicted to fail, the system does not have sufficient evidence to change the user's view of _bel; thus, the focus of modification for _bel is nil (step  The result of Select-Focus-Modification is a set of user beliefs (in _belfocus) that need to be modified in order to change the user's belief about the unaccepted top-level belief On the other hand, Grice's maxim of quantity specifies that one should not contribute more information than is required Thus, it is important that a collaborative agent selects sufficient and effective, but not excessive, evidence to justify an intended mutual belief If so, no justification will be presented If justification is predicted to be necessary, the system will first construct the justification chains that could be used to support _bel For each piece of evidence that could be used to directly support _bel, the system first predicts whether the user will accept the evidence without justification This results in a recursive process that returns a chain of belief justifications that could be used to support _bel This will produce a set of possible candidate justification chains, and three heuristics will then be applied to select from among them After the evaluation of the dialogue model in Figure , Modify-Proposal is invoked because the top-level proposed belief is not accepted In selecting the focus of modification, the system will first identify the candidate foci tree and then invoke the Select-Focus-Modification algorithm on the belief at the root node of the candidate foci tree1 in Figure  The Correct-Node specialization of Modify-Proposal will be invoked since the focus of modification is a belief, and in order to satisfy the precondition of Modify-Node (Figure MB(S,U, On-Sabbatical(Smith,next year will be posted as a mutual belief to be achieved to (9) He postponed his sabbatical until 1997 The model captures features specific to collaborative negotiation This distinguishes collaborative negotiation from non-collaborative negotiation such as labor negotiation  Our system maintains a set of beliefs about the domain and about the user's beliefs Associated with each belief is a strength that represents the agent's confidence in holding that belief Thus, when facing a conflict, a collaborative agent should not automatically reject a belief with which she does not agree; instead, she should evaluate the belief and the evidence provided to her and adopt the belief if the evidence is convincing The belief level of the dialogue model consists of mutual beliefs proposed by the agents' discourse actions When an agent proposes a new belief and gives (optional) supporting evidence for it, this set of proposed beliefs is represented as a belief tree, where the belief represented by a child node is intended to support that represented by its parent The evaluation of proposed beliefs starts at the leaf nodes of the proposed belief trees since acceptance of a piece of proposed evidence may affect acceptance of the parent belief it is intended to support The process continues until the top-level proposed beliefs are evaluated Conflict resolution strategies are invoked only if the top-level proposed beliefs are not accepted because if collaborative agents agree on a belief relevant to the domain plan being constructed, it is irrelevant whether they agree on the evidence for that belief  In determining whether to accept a proposed belief or evidential relationship, the evaluator first constructs an evidence set containing the system's evidence that supports or attacks _bel and the evidence accepted by the system that was proposed by the user as support for _bel Each piece of evidence contains a belief _beli, and an evidential relationship supports beli bel  If, during information-sharing, the user provides convincing support for a belief whose negation is held by the system, the system may adopt the belief after the re-evaluation process, thus resolving the conflict without negotiation The belief evaluation process will start with the belief at the leaf node of the proposed belief tree, On-Sabbatical(Smith,next year  The system will first gather its evidence pertaining to the belief, which includes 1) a warranted belief that Dr The belief revision mechanism will then be invoked to determine the system's belief about On-Sabbatical(Smith, next year) based on the system's own evidence and the user's statement Since beliefs (1) and (2) above constitute a warranted piece of evidence against the proposed belief and beliefs (3) and (4) constitute a strong piece of evidence against it, the system will not accept On-Sabbatical(Smith, next year  When applied to belief modification, Modify-Proposal has two specializations: Correct-Node, for when a proposed belief is not accepted, and Correct-Relation, for when a proposed evidential relationship is not accepted The attempt to satisfy the precondition causes the system to post as a mutual belief to be achieved the belief that _node is not acceptable, leading the system to adopt discourse actions to change _s2's beliefs, thus initiating a collaborative negotiation subdialogue The goal of the modification process is to resolve the agents' conflicts regarding the unaccepted top-level proposed beliefs For each such belief, the system could provide evidence against the belief itself, address the unaccepted evidence proposed by the user to eliminate the user's justification for the belief, or both Therefore, for each unaccepted top-level belief, our process for selecting the focus of modification involves two steps: identifying a candidate foci tree from the proposed belief tree, and selecting a focus from the candidate foci tree using the heuristic attack the belief(s) that will most likely resolve the conflict about the top-level belief A candidate foci tree contains the pieces of evidence in a proposed belief tree which, if disbelieved by the user, might change the user's view of the unaccepted top-level proposed belief (the root node of that belief tree  It is identified by performing a depth-first search on the proposed belief tree If both the belief and relationship were accepted by the evaluator, the search on the current branch will terminate, since once the system accepts a belief, it is irrelevant whether it accepts the user's support for that belief  Otherwise, this piece of evidence will be included in the candidate foci tree and the system will continue to search through the evidence in the belief tree proposed as support for the unaccepted belief and/or evidential relationship Once a candidate foci tree is identified, the system should select the focus of modification based on the likelihood of each choice changing the user's belief about the top-level belief Given an unaccepted belief bel) and the beliefs proposed to support it, Select-Focus-Modification will annotate _bel with 1) its focus of modification belfocus which contains a set of beliefs bel and/or its descendents) which, if disbelieved by the user, are predicted to cause him to disbelieve _bel, and 2) the system's evidence against _bel itself bels-attack  However, in evaluating the effectiveness of attacking the proposed evidence for _bel, the system must determine whether or not it is possible to successfully refute a piece of evidence (i Thus the algorithm recursively applies itself to the evidence proposed as support for _bel which was not accepted by the system (step  In this recursive process, the algorithm annotates each unaccepted belief or evidential relationship proposed to support _bel with its focus of modification belifocus) and the system's evidence against it beli
