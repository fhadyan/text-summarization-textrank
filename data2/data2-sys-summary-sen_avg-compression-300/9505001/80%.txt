instead, she should evaluate the belief and the evidence provided to her and adopt the belief if the evidence is convincing The belief level of the dialogue model consists of mutual beliefs proposed by the agents' discourse actions When an agent proposes a new belief and gives (optional) supporting evidence for it, this set of proposed beliefs is represented as a belief tree, where the belief represented by a child node is intended to support that represented by its parent The evaluation of proposed beliefs starts at the leaf nodes of the proposed belief trees since acceptance of a piece of proposed evidence may affect acceptance of the parent belief it is intended to support In determining whether to accept a proposed belief or evidential relationship, the evaluator first constructs an evidence set containing the system's evidence that supports or attacks _bel and the evidence accepted by the system that was proposed by the user as support for _bel Each piece of evidence contains a belief _beli, and an evidential relationship supports beli bel  The belief evaluation process will start with the belief at the leaf node of the proposed belief tree, On-Sabbatical(Smith,next year  The system will first gather its evidence pertaining to the belief, which includes 1) a warranted belief that Dr The belief revision mechanism will then be invoked to determine the system's belief about On-Sabbatical(Smith, next year) based on the system's own evidence and the user's statement Since beliefs (1) and (2) above constitute a warranted piece of evidence against the proposed belief and beliefs (3) and (4) constitute a strong piece of evidence against it, the system will not accept On-Sabbatical(Smith, next year  For each such belief, the system could provide evidence against the belief itself, address the unaccepted evidence proposed by the user to eliminate the user's justification for the belief, or both Therefore, for each unaccepted top-level belief, our process for selecting the focus of modification involves two steps: identifying a candidate foci tree from the proposed belief tree, and selecting a focus from the candidate foci tree using the heuristic attack the belief(s) that will most likely resolve the conflict about the top-level belief A candidate foci tree contains the pieces of evidence in a proposed belief tree which, if disbelieved by the user, might change the user's view of the unaccepted top-level proposed belief (the root node of that belief tree  It is identified by performing a depth-first search on the proposed belief tree Otherwise, this piece of evidence will be included in the candidate foci tree and the system will continue to search through the evidence in the belief tree proposed as support for the unaccepted belief and/or evidential relationship Given an unaccepted belief bel) and the beliefs proposed to support it, Select-Focus-Modification will annotate _bel with 1) its focus of modification bel In this recursive process, the algorithm annotates each unaccepted belief or evidential relationship proposed to support _bel with its focus of modification belifocus) and the system's evidence against it beli
