iii) no presupposition for any column Then the compositionality rules are applied to the resulting tableau in order to obtain the presuppositions of the sentence Assuming a logical form for this sentence , the tableau for this sentence would be: The presupposition rules applied to this tableau predict no presupposition The presupposition of a presuppositional sentence added to a tableau is satisfied if the tableau is closed The presupposition of a presuppositional sentence added to a tableau is canceled if the tableau is closed In Gervs , these problems are addressed by providing tableau expansion rules for presupposition This makes presuppositional information explicit in the framework The behaviour of presuppositions of sentences of this form has traditionally been studied as part of the projection problem for presuppositions, which is concerned with describing the presuppositions of a sentence in terms of the presuppositions of its subordinate clauses Presuppositions (of negative sentences) are represented as normal defaults This approach considers presupposition as anaphora Presupposition has the additional property (often used to characterize it) that the negation of a sentence has the same presuppositions as the sentence itself In the present framework, these definitions are represented as tableaux expansion rules Tableau expansion rules: Classical negation operates over the language wherever reasoning about negated sentences is required They include definitions of: a tableau, a branch of a tableau, branch closure, and closure for a tableau The definition of tableau expansion rules ensures that these tableau obey a special property Coverage Property: If one branch of a tableau holds a sentence , then every (open) branch of that tableau will hold either or  The compositionality rules for presupposition do not take into account presuppositional information from branches of a tableau that are closed Rule 2 For a tableau with at least one open branch , iff  This can be used to show that if a tableau has a branch that presupposes a proposition, then every branch of the tableau will presuppose that proposition Conversely, if a tableau has a (open) branch that does not presuppose a proposition, then no branch of the tableau will presuppose that proposition The representation for this sentence in this framework would be: Application of the rules predicts a presupposition for the sentence
