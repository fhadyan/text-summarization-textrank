 Although presupposition originates as a natural language phenomenon, for the purposes of the present work sentences will be represented as propositions of a logical language Sentence (4) If there is a typewriter then the typewriter is blue corresponds to the following representation Example (5) Either there isn't a typewriter or the typewriter is blue shows the case where the presuppositions of one of the disjuncts are not presuppositions of the disjunction The method can also handle the case of disjunctions with contradictory presuppositionsiii) no presupposition for any column Application of rule 2 gives no presupposition for the whole compound First the sentence is expanded into a tableaux by application of the expansion rules Then the compositionality rules are applied to the resulting tableau in order to obtain the presuppositions of the sentence Assuming a logical form for this sentence , the tableau for this sentence would be: The presupposition rules applied to this tableau predict no presupposition The tableaux framework allows definition of some of the traditional concepts that surround presupposition The presupposition of a presuppositional sentence added to a tableau is satisfied if the tableau is closed The presupposition of a presuppositional sentence added to a tableau is canceled if the tableau is closed The compositionality rules rely on the semantics in general terms The framework presented here provides a method for determining the behaviour of presuppositions of complex logical statements in a compositional manner The semantics used in the present framework are chosen to ensure that all the different valid alternatives implied by a sentence are listed explicitly in a tableau for that sentence, and all atomic formulas involved appear (either negated or not) in every branch (Coverage Property  In Gervs , these problems are addressed by providing tableau expansion rules for presupposition This makes presuppositional information explicit in the framework The behaviour of presuppositions of sentences of this form has traditionally been studied as part of the projection problem for presuppositions, which is concerned with describing the presuppositions of a sentence in terms of the presuppositions of its subordinate clauses At this level of granularity, presupposition can simply be represented as a relation between sentences Presuppositions (of negative sentences) are represented as normal defaults This approach considers presupposition as anaphora Presupposition has the additional property (often used to characterize it) that the negation of a sentence has the same presuppositions as the sentence itself In the present framework, these definitions are represented as tableaux expansion rules Tableau expansion rules: Classical negation operates over the language wherever reasoning about negated sentences is required Apart from the expansion rules, these definitions follow existing tableau frameworks for propositional logic They include definitions of: a tableau, a branch of a tableau, branch closure, and closure for a tableau The definition of tableau expansion rules ensures that these tableau obey a special property Coverage Property: If one branch of a tableau holds a sentence , then every (open) branch of that tableau will hold either or  A consequence of this property in terms of the semantics, is that each branch of the tableau contains a complete atomic truth-value assignment that makes the sentence true The present framework differs from traditional tableaux only in the definition of expansion rules Given that the definitions of tableau, tableau for a set of sentences, closure, proof and refutation are the same in the PT framework as in ST tableaux, the discussion concerns only the expansion rules Over the representation of the logical language given in the previous section, compositionality of presupposition can be defined Two issues need to be dealt with: 1) how the presuppositions of a branch are ascertained from the presuppositions of the atomic propositions in it, and 2) how the presuppositions of branches of the same tableau interact The notation for presupposition is extended to branches so that stands for `the branch presupposes  The compositionality rules for presupposition do not take into account presuppositional information from branches of a tableau that are closed Rule 2 For a tableau with at least one open branch , iff  This can be used to show that if a tableau has a branch that presupposes a proposition, then every branch of the tableau will presuppose that proposition Conversely, if a tableau has a (open) branch that does not presuppose a proposition, then no branch of the tableau will presuppose that proposition The representation for this sentence in this framework would be: Application of the rules predicts a presupposition for the sentence
