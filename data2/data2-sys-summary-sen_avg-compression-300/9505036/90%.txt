 This paper concerns how to generate and understand discourse anaphoric noun phrases, or noun phrases (NPs) that evoke a discourse entity already in the discourse model (Webber webber78  Dale dale89 dale92 implements Gricean constraints on informativeness for generating discourse anaphoric NPs Results in include a one-way correlation of overly informative discourse anaphoric NPs with shifts in global discourse structure The data reported above indicates that in the Pear corpus, definite pronouns and phrasal NPs are rarely over-specified or over-determined Dale dale89 generates anaphoric pronouns and phrasal NPs by distinct means Dale dale89 requires phrasal NPs to be distinguishing descriptions5% rate of over-specified discourse anaphoric NPs in the Pear data also supports the relaxation of brevity, but is partly conditioned by attentional factors (cf In this section I illustrate the role of in processing definite pronouns and phrasal NPs C_describe is a 4-place relation among a discourse entity E, a surface NP, the current utterance context , and the discourse context C that requires to be a distinguishing description of E relative to C The next subsection presents results showing that discourse anaphoric NPs in the corpus, whether pronominal or phrasal, are rarely more informative than necessary, and if so, tend to occur at shifts in global discourse structure Dale dale89 takes the universe of discourse to be partitioned into focus spaces (cf Given such a mechanism, a new focus space would be added to the discourse model after a segment onset has been processed Partitioning the search space into focus spaces controls the search through the discourse model to some degree Above, I noted that centering can add structure to the search space for understanding discourse anaphoric NPs The phrasal NPs in (2b) are adequate but not efficient (over-specified  However, his model follows the tradition of assuming that distinct constraints govern pronouns versus phrasal NPs (cf But in this context, neither the pronoun alone nor the utterance is a distinguishing description of anyone, so the pronoun is under-specified I have presented an analysis of discourse anaphoric phrasal NPs in a corpus of narrative monologues showing that pronouns and phrasal NPs are rarely over-specified I argue that Gricean constraints should be applied equally to discourse anaphoric pronouns and phrasal NPs, and that integrating centering and informational constraints covers a broader range of cases Discourse anaphoric NPs almost never provide new information, and are rarely more informative than necessary Any phrasal NP that is discourse anaphoric is potentially over-specified, whereas a definite pronoun will only be over-specified if a zero pronoun could have been used I first sorted the discourse anaphoric NPs in the corpus (N=1,233) into the three categories of phrasal NPs (PhrNPs; N=563 explicit pronouns (PROs: definite, indefinite, demonstrative; N=544 and zero pronominals (ZPs; N=126  This procedure identified 128 discourse anaphoric NPs in the corpus that were potentially over-specified or over-determined Potentially over-specified NPs were sorted into four mutually exclusive categories well-specified, segment onset, attentional shift, and reiterative While centering has been used to account for informationally under-specified pronouns, I argue that centering also accounts for certain over-specified phrasal NPs To account for the choice of modifiers in phrasal discourse anaphoric NPs, it is necessary to determine how attributes are selected from the information known about a discourse entity
