 We start out from the set of infinite constructor trees with holes (free variables  The decidability problem for our constraints turned out to be equivalent to weak subsumption over feature graphs solved by Drre for feature graphs with feature (but no arity) constraints The algorithm decides satisfiability of constraints containing equations and , and constraints over infinite constructor trees with free variables The types of the variables involved are described by the following constraint If V is a further set of variables then stands for the set of all finite or infinite trees over signature and variables V We build constraints over a set of constraint variables ranged over by x, y, z, u, v, w Constraint variables must contain at least base variables Constraints are atomic constraints closed under conjunction Its interpretation is defined by  This means that free variables in the semantic domain do not affect equality constraints The trees of are called ground trees Let us consider constructor trees as special feature trees with integer-valued features, a distinguished feature label (e Intersection variables are defined as nonempty finite subsets of base variables We have presented an algorithm for deciding satisfiability of constraints over infinite constructor trees with holes Type checking polymorphic recursion is equivalent to semi-unification and to subsumption of feature graphs
