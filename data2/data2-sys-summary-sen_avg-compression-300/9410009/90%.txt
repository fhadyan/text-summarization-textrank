g ( ( that collocational systems are systematically predictable from the lexical semantics of nouns Again, we suggest the use of merged LFs and corresponding mappings via lexical paraphrasing rules as a possible translation strategy in these cases Our use of lexical functions as an interlingua assumes that the relevant aspects of the meaning of the collocate are fully captured by the LF We have suggested some ways in which LFs can be enriched with lexical semantic information to improve translation quality Given that collocations may translate as non-collocations, we also have to provide a way to represent these expressions using lexical functions The use we make of lexical functions as interlingual representations, does not respect their original Mel'cukian interpretation In the lexical combinatorics zone, we find a list of the lexical functions that are relevant to this particular lexeme Lexical functions are used to represent an important syntactico-semantic relation between the base and the collocate Choosing the level at which lexical functions will be situated Relating the collocate information to the free variant entry In contrast to the ECD, the meaning of the collocate is represented by the lexical function only Each collocate subentry bears the value of the lexical function in its semantics field In this representation the lexical function is chosen as the real semantic value of the collocate The collocate subentry only provides partial information The project has tried to investigate the use of lexical functions as an interlingual device, i This information is used to generate the correct translation in the target language This treatment of collocations rests, among others, on the assumptions that there are only a limited number of lexical functions, that lexical functions can be assigned consistently, that all (or a significant number of) collocations realise a lexical function, that lexical functions are not restricted to particular languages, etc Lexical Functions abstract away from certain nuances in meaning and from different syntactic realizations
