 We have suggested some ways in which LFs can be enriched with lexical semantic information to improve translation quality In the lexical combinatorics zone, we find a list of the lexical functions that are relevant to this particular lexeme Lexical functions are used to represent an important syntactico-semantic relation between the base and the collocate Choosing the level at which lexical functions will be situated Each collocate subentry bears the value of the lexical function in its semantics field In this representation the lexical function is chosen as the real semantic value of the collocate This treatment of collocations rests, among others, on the assumptions that there are only a limited number of lexical functions, that lexical functions can be assigned consistently, that all (or a significant number of) collocations realise a lexical function, that lexical functions are not restricted to particular languages, etc Lexical Functions abstract away from certain nuances in meaning and from different syntactic realizations
