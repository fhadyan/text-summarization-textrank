 A tree is an auxiliary tree if the root and some frontier node (which becomes the foot node) have some non-empty SF value in common In the trees shown, nodes detected as foot nodes are marked with  To allow for adjoining of auxiliary trees whose root and foot differ in their SFs, we could produce a number of different trees representing partial projections from each lexical anchor Consider T1 whose root and foot differ in their SFs It is determined which trees are auxiliary trees, and then the relationships between the SFs associated with the root and foot in these auxiliary trees are recorded However, immediately after applying a rule schema, the features at the bottom of a domination link are compared with the foot nodes of auxiliary trees that have differing SFs at foot and root This also provides a method for deriving the distinctions between initial and auxiliary trees, including the identification of foot nodes in auxiliary trees Add another node m dominating the root node of the instantiated schema Traditionally, in TAG, auxiliary trees are said to be minimal recursive structures that have a foot node (at the frontier) labelled identical to the root
