 To allow for adjoining of auxiliary trees whose root and foot differ in their SFs, we could produce a number of different trees representing partial projections from each lexical anchor It is determined which trees are auxiliary trees, and then the relationships between the SFs associated with the root and foot in these auxiliary trees are recorded This also provides a method for deriving the distinctions between initial and auxiliary trees, including the identification of foot nodes in auxiliary trees
