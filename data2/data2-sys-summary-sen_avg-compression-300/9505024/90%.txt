 These are relatively easy to mark and recognise when the punctuation is available For the longer sentences of real language, however, a grammar which makes use of punctuation massively outperforms an otherwise similar grammar that ignores it Therefore, following the recognition that punctuation can play a crucial role in natural language syntax, what is needed is a thorough investigation into the theory of punctuation However, little mention is made anywhere of the role of punctuation within a syntactic framework In addition to the phenomena associated with the interaction of punctuation, there are also distinct phenomena observable in the interaction of punctuation and lexical expressions A lexical grammar is proposed for the lexical expressions occurring between punctuation marks, and a text grammar is proposed for the structure of the punctuation, and the relation of those marks to the lexical expressions they separate However, in practice, this system seems unlikely to succeed since in order to work, the lexical expressions that occur between punctuation marks must carry additional information about the syntactic categories occurring at their edges so that the text grammar can constrain the function of the punctuation marks In addition, it is difficult to imagine what linguistic or psychological motivation such a separation of punctuation from lexical text could hold, since it seems rather unlikely that people process punctuation at a separate level to the text it surrounds Hence it seems more sensible to use an integrated grammar, which handles both words and punctuation Specifically mentioning the punctuation mark prevents the delimited phrase from being unstopped, resulting in an unstopped mother category In order to incorporate the phenomena of interaction between punctuation and lexical expressions (e Similarly, for sentences including only one or two marks of punctuation, the use of punctuation is likely to be rather procedural, and hence not necessarily very revealing This features some very long sentences, and includes rich and varied punctuation The unpunctuated version of the grammar was prepared by removing all the features relating to specifically punctuational phenomena, and also removing explicit mention of punctuation marks from the rules
