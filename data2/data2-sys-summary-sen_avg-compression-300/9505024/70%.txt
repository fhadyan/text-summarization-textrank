 Instead, punctuation is usually stripped out of the text before processing, and is not included in generated text This in turn introduces new problems, since there is a great deal of idiosyncrasy associated with the use of punctuation marks The punctuated grammar had to allow for sentences including comma-delimited noun phrases adjacent to undelimited noun phrases, as illustrated by the rules (15) and (16  These are relatively easy to mark and recognise when the punctuation is available However, without punctuational clues, and with the under-specific tagging system, any compound noun could appear as a set of delimited noun phrases with the unpunctuated grammar Results were within an order of magnitude, showing that no significant advantage was gained through the use of punctuation The sentences in (23) and (24) received 1 and 11 parses respectively with the unpunctuated grammar For the most complex sentences, however, the number of parses with the unpunctuated grammar was typically more than two orders of magnitude higher than with the punctuated grammar In his recent review, Humphreys [1993] suggests that accounts of punctuation fall into three categories: The first is selflessly dedicated to the task of bringing Punctuation to the Peasantry The second sort is the Style Guide, written by editors and printers for the private pleasure of fellow professionals The third, on the linguistics of the punctuation system, is much the rarest of all Thus whilst we do not really want to rely on publishers' style guides, since the accounts of punctuation they contain are rather too proscriptive and concentrate on the use of punctuation rather than its meaning, the academic accounts of punctuation are far from numerous Parsing the unseen sentences with the unpunctuated grammar resulted in one parse failure, with the results for the other 9 sentences reflecting the previous results for complex sentences For the longer sentences of real language, however, a grammar which makes use of punctuation massively outperforms an otherwise similar grammar that ignores it However, as was shown by the attempt at parsing the novel sentences, knowledge of the role of punctuation is still severely limited Therefore, following the recognition that punctuation can play a crucial role in natural language syntax, what is needed is a thorough investigation into the theory of punctuation Then theoretically based analyses of punctuation can play a full and important part in the analysis of language However, little mention is made anywhere of the role of punctuation within a syntactic framework Therefore the current investigation tries to determine whether taking consideration of punctuation can further the goals of syntactic analysis of natural language In addition to the nature of different punctuation marks, there are several phenomena described by Nunberg [1990] which it is useful to consider before implementing any treatment of punctuation: sep 0mm Point absorption: strong point symbols (comma, dash, semicolon, etc absorb weaker adjacent ones (4  In addition to the phenomena associated with the interaction of punctuation, there are also distinct phenomena observable in the interaction of punctuation and lexical expressions A lexical grammar is proposed for the lexical expressions occurring between punctuation marks, and a text grammar is proposed for the structure of the punctuation, and the relation of those marks to the lexical expressions they separate The text grammar has within it distinct levels, such as phrasal and clausal, at which distinct punctuational phenomena can occur However, in practice, this system seems unlikely to succeed since in order to work, the lexical expressions that occur between punctuation marks must carry additional information about the syntactic categories occurring at their edges so that the text grammar can constrain the function of the punctuation marks A rule in the text grammar could then process the separating comma as it clearly comes between two similar syntactic elements However, as (11) shows, the separating comma concept could require information about the categories at arbitrarily deep levels occurring at the ends of lexical expressions surrounding punctuation marks In addition, it is difficult to imagine what linguistic or psychological motivation such a separation of punctuation from lexical text could hold, since it seems rather unlikely that people process punctuation at a separate level to the text it surrounds Hence it seems more sensible to use an integrated grammar, which handles both words and punctuation Since the rules of the grammar further dictate that the mother category inherits the stop value of its rightmost daughter, only rules to specifically add punctuation for categories which could be lexicalised are necessary Thus a rule for the additional of a punctuation mark after a lexicalised noun would be as in (14  Specifically mentioning the punctuation mark prevents the delimited phrase from being unstopped, resulting in an unstopped mother category Punctuation has long been considered to be intimately related to intonation: that is that different punctuation marks simply give the reader cues as to the possible prosodic and pausal characteristics of the text [Markwardt, 1942  In order to incorporate the phenomena of interaction between punctuation and lexical expressions (e Since this work only represents the initial steps of providing a full and proper account of the role of punctuation, no claims are made for the theoretical validity or completeness of this approach! For the current investigation it was necessary to use a corpus sufficiently rich in punctuation to illustrate the possible advantages or disadvantages of utilising punctuation within the parsing process Obviously a sentence which includes no punctuation will be equally difficult to parse with both punctuated and unpunctuated grammars Similarly, for sentences including only one or two marks of punctuation, the use of punctuation is likely to be rather procedural, and hence not necessarily very revealing This features some very long sentences, and includes rich and varied punctuation The lengths of the sentences varied from 3 words to 63 words, the average being 31 words; and the punctuational complexity of the sentences varied from one mark (just a period) to 16 marks, the average being 4 punctuation marks The unpunctuated version of the grammar was prepared by removing all the features relating to specifically punctuational phenomena, and also removing explicit mention of punctuation marks from the rules
