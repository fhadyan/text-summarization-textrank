 (T11) In , since vehicle B was not respecting the ground markings it made a mistake in cutting back in on W's vehicle Vehicle B was driving in the left lane reserved for vehicles going left (ground markings with arrows  It cut back in on my vehicle (14) e (T2) e (T11) e (T10) e (T4) e tre surpris to be surprised and make frequent use of the negation (15) b (16) b I wasn't able to avoid the car which was coming with great speed (T8) b (18) I was driving at about 45 km/h in a small one-way street where cars were parked on both sides In addition to , some more examples are given in  (19) c but I hit the second car which hadn't yet gone through the stop-sign (T1) c I wasn't able to avoid the car which was coming with great speed (T8) c We go in more details into some examples In this case, it must be in order to assert that his behavior was conforming to the Rules of the Road which is a pertinent fact to mention In example , repeated here as for convenience, the use of the pluperfect had switched on is ambiguous Vehicle B coming from my left squeezed too close to me and damaged the whole left front side It must therefore be the left blinker To make a decision, arguments of the Maxims type must be used R cannot assume that too much information is present in the text Therefore, by appealing to the rule proposed in , the first interpretation is chosen and R may conclude that W had his left blinker on In , we saw that there were two possible choices for a point of reference in the interpretation of the pluperfect It can also have a more agentive interpretation and then it means to actively prepare for It seems that in most cases, such an intended future event is more than simply intentional and that W has indeed already started to act The car skidded on the wet pavement and struck a sidewalk then a fence straight ahead The truck driver had indeed switched on his left blinker, but the trailer was inverting the signal to the right Not having touched me, the driver declared himself unconcerned by the situation and refused to draw a report (T2) (24) I was stopped at the intersection wishing to take the road on which the intense traffic is going one-way in two lanes; as the last vehicle of the flow was coming, I wanted to enter the second lane, leaving the first one free for it (T5) Instead of using an imperfective verbal form (i This lack of precision (or downright lie is intentional and allows W to try to lessen his responsibility, which will succeed if R opts for a purely intentional reading of the verbal form (1) Text Parameters A These two symmetrical tasks are thus both composed of a factual and an argumentative part These two parts also coincide with the two goals we can define for an NLP approach to understanding and processing these texts Parameter A (the fact that car accidents usually involve two participants, most often two vehicles) is used to infer the identity of some entities in the texts, or to establish coreference between two entities the text involves at least two participants, generally two vehicles, one of which is the author's; B Vehicle B arrived and hit my left side mirror with its right side mirror Metonymy is often used to allow the identification of the container with its content, and a common use of metonymy in our texts concerns the vehicle and its driver (5) b Vehicle B wanted to turn right b Being momentarily stopped in the right lane on Boulevard des Italiens, I had switched my blinker on; I was at a stop and getting ready to change lanes Vehicle B coming from my left squeezed too close to me and damaged the whole left front side (6) b One of the cars in front of me opened its right front door (T3) b My husband had entered the intersection when Mr X's car hit the front of the vehicle In , the property of rolling along (the literal meaning of the verb rouler) is transferred to the driver (7) b my bumper (T11) b car: inanimate mechanical object into an entity of another type (e squeeze: requires an agentive subject  For instance, a number of inferences, some of them spatial, are necessary to find the identity of the agent, i the passenger in the right front seat, in  Finding the exact referent of an expression is necessary in order to block wrong inferences We rediscover here Grice's Maxims , in particular the Maxim of Quantity, or Ducrot's exhaustivity law  Keeping as close as possible to the right, I wasn't able to avoid the car which was coming with great speed (T8) The text in mentions only two vehicles The first one, W's, is implicit in I was driving In many of our texts, the accident is explicitly mentioned with verbs such as percuter, endommager, toucher, heurter collide damage touch hit or with nouns such as choc, collision impact collision  But this is not the case in , a text for which, if it was another type of narrative, we might imagine other endings to the incident (e K concerns vehicles, vehicle motions, traffic rules, the usual behavior of drivers and pedestrians, and also some elements of naive geometry contrasting what was expected and what happened in reality, by invoking unforeseable circumstances With either strategy, W must first show that he has done everything that was required in the given circumstances and will always try to appear as innocent as possible With strategy A, W wants to suggest or to say explicitly that the other driver is at fault (12) The driver of vehicle B passed me on the right
