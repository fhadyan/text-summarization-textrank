 By making this natural assumption, we may then explain the curious fact that * Jack ran to the bridge for two miles is horrible, in sharp contrast to both Jack ran two miles to the bridge and Jack ran along the river for two miles This is illustrated below: One consequence of the present approach is that Jack run along the river for two miles and Jack run two miles along the river are assigned rather different representations for further details  To see that this representation is also concise, note that one can also derive numerous other sentences from this structure, given appropriate rules of inference: for example, Jack filled a bucket, Jack filled something, etcg bucket A, bucket E  Moreover, this representation is similarly concise: given appropriate rules of inference, one can also derive Jack poured water into bucket A for twenty-five seconds, Jack poured water into bucket A for twenty seconds, and so forth Jack poured five gallons of water into bucket A *for/in thirty seconds contrariwise, switching to a bare plural in the first example, we may note a switch in the opposite direction (cf Jack filled buckets for in twenty minutes  Turning now to the second question, we should first note that Jack poured water into bucket A and Jack filled bucket A with water exhibit different aspectual behavior, despite the presence of the same mass noun For this reason, Krifka eschews sortal distinctions (amongst eventualities) and develops an account based upon the reference properties of event predicates instead For example, with our pouring process (e the agent (Jack) and the goal (bucket A) remain constant across the particular events which make up the continuum what I shall call a non-delimited path the distance between the path and the reference object, which can remain constant across a path continuum This explains why sentences like Jack ran along the river, two hundred yards from the shore, for thirty seconds should be well-formed
