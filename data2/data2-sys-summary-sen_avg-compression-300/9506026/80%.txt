 By making this natural assumption, we may then explain the curious fact that * Jack ran to the bridge for two miles is horrible, in sharp contrast to both Jack ran two miles to the bridge and Jack ran along the river for two miles This is illustrated below: One consequence of the present approach is that Jack run along the river for two miles and Jack run two miles along the river are assigned rather different representations To see that this representation is also concise, note that one can also derive numerous other sentences from this structure, given appropriate rules of inference: for example, Jack filled a bucket, Jack filled something, etcg bucket A, bucket E  As a second example, let us now consider the following representation of a pouring process e1: It should be evident once again that this structure can be straightforwardly translated into the English sentence Jack poured water into bucket A for thirty seconds Moreover, this representation is similarly concise: given appropriate rules of inference, one can also derive Jack poured water into bucket A for twenty-five seconds, Jack poured water into bucket A for twenty seconds, and so forth Jack poured five gallons of water into bucket A *for/in thirty seconds contrariwise, switching to a bare plural in the first example, we may note a switch in the opposite direction (cf Jack filled buckets for in twenty minutes  Turning now to the second question, we should first note that Jack poured water into bucket A and Jack filled bucket A with water exhibit different aspectual behavior, despite the presence of the same mass noun As Krifka points out, the conventional wisdom about aspectual composition does not appear to be compatible with a sortal approach: For consider a concrete event of running and a concrete event of running a mile; then surely both events have a terminal point (both events might even be identical  For this reason, Krifka eschews sortal distinctions (amongst eventualities) and develops an account based upon the reference properties of event predicates instead One possibility is to assume that substances and processes are more abstract entities than objects and events: for example, rather than letting a substance be a particular quantity of matter, we may assume a substance is a continuum of such quantities; likewise, we may take a process to be a continuum of events with differing durations This yields the following representations for our example sentences: To paraphrase, in the first case e1 is an event of duration thirty seconds which is composed of a process e in which Jack pours the substance x, which is water, into bucket A At this point we may answer the two questions with which we began this section various concrete objects) when the relevant participant remains constant across the continuum For example, with our pouring process (e the agent (Jack) and the goal (bucket A) remain constant across the particular events which make up the continuum This explains why * Jack ran to the bridge for thirty seconds is not well-formed, as illustrated below (recall that the composed-of relation serves to map processes to events Unlike to-phrases, towards-phrases do make sense for non-delimited paths, since these specify direction rather than endpoints (and direction can remains constant across a continuum  Although the continuum e may contain events larger than e1, it cannot contain any events larger than the event in which Jack reaches the bridge, as the path of any such event would no longer satisfy the predicated yielded by towards the bridge the distance between the path and the reference object, which can remain constant across a path continuum This explains why sentences like Jack ran along the river, two hundred yards from the shore, for thirty seconds should be well-formed Consequently, bare distance phrases will behave just like to-PPs, which explains both why Jack ran two miles to the bridge is fine and why * Jack ran two miles for ten minutes is out
