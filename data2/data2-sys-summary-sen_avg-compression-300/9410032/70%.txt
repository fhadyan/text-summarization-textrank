 The macroplanner of PROVERB combines hierarchical planning with local organization in a uniform planning framework The hierarchical planning is realized by so-called top-down presentation operators that split the task of presenting a particular proof into subtasks of presenting subproofs While the overall planning mechanism follows the RST-based planning approach , , the planning operators more closely resemble the schemata in schema-based planning ,  Bottom-up presentation operators are devised to simulate the unplanned aspect, where the next intermediate conclusion to be presented is chosen under the guidance of the local focus mechanism in a more spontaneous way Since top-down operators embody explicit communicative norms, they are always given a higher priority Only when no top-down presentation operator is applicable, will a bottom-up presentation operator be chosen The output is an ordered sequence of proof communicative act intentions (PCAs  PROVERB combines the two above mentioned presentation modes by encoding communication knowledge for both top-down planning and bottom-up presentation in form of operators in a uniform planning framework Since top-down presentation operators embody explicit communicative norms, they are given a higher priority A bottom-up presentation is chosen only when no top-down presentation operator applies Each cycle carries out one presentation operator, where Present always tries first to choose and apply a top-down operator The function Present is first called with the entire proof as the presentation task The execution of a top-down presentation operator may generate subtasks by calling it recursively The discourse model is also segmented into an attentional hierarchy, where subproofs posted by a top-down presentation operators as subtasks constitute attentional units The following are some notions useful for the formulation of the presentation operators: Task is the subproof in the input proof whose presentation is the current task These PCAs sometimes also convey a partial plan for the further presentation Although top-down and bottom-up presentation activities are of a conceptually different nature, the corresponding communication knowledge is uniformly encoded as presentation operators in a planning framework, similar to the plan operators in other generation systems , , ,  In general, presentation operators map an original presentation task into a sequence of subtasks and finally into a sequence of PCAs Acts: a procedure which essentially carries out a sequence of presentation acts In contrast with operators employed in RST-based planners that split goals according to the rhetorical structures, our operators encode standard schemata for presenting proofs, which contain subgoals The top-down presentation operators are roughly divided into two categories: schemata-based operators encoding complex schemata for the presentation of proofs of a specific pattern (twelve of them are currently integrated in PROVERB general operators embodying general presentation norms, concerning splitting proofs and ordering subgoals
