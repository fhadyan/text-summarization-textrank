 The usual disclaimers apply and may themselves be function categories For example, subject NPs bear the following category in the full notation: traumaid The derivation of the same simple transitive sentence using type-raised categories is illustrated in example in the abbreviated notation [a You propose, and Traumaid recommends, lavage Then we lock these two structural systems together via the following principle, which says that syntactic and prosodic constituency must be isomorphic: PROSODIC CONSTITUENT CONDITION: Combination of two syntactic categories via a syntactic combinatory rule is only allowed if their prosodic categories can also combine via a prosodic combinatory rule For example, the boundary L maps an H* pitch accent into an intermediate phrase rheme, p:rheme There may also be material bearing null tone separating the pitch accent(s) from the boundary These rules change the prosodic category either to utterance, or to an endocentric function over that category Example  Traumaid recommends LA VAGE Q: Does Traumaid prefer a LEFT thoracotomy or a RIGHT thoracotomy? A: (Traumaid prefers) (a LEFT thoracotomy The mere fact that alternatives are contrasted on a given property is not enough however to mandate the inclusion of a pitch accent on the corresponding linguistic material Thus, in a situation in which the choices include a left thoracotomy, a right thoracotomy, a left thoracostomy and a right thoracostomy, the response to question , in which the adjective is unstressed, is perfectly appropriate: Q: Does Traumaid prefer a LEFT thora COTomy or a RIGHT thora COSTomy? A: (Traumaid prefers) (a left thora COTomy This example suggests that the set that is being considered by the time the adjective is semantically evaluated is no longer the entire set including the left and right thoracotomy and thoracostomy procedures In fact, it is not even the set containing only the left thoracotomy and right thoracostomy procedures, but rather the set containing only the left thoracotomy procedure, which by definition does not stand in contrast to any other thoracotomy procedure by virtue of the property of being performed on the left side This set arises because the noun thoracotomy restricts over the set including the left thoracotomy and the right thoracostomy procedures Q: Does Traumaid prefer a LEFT thora COTomy, a RIGHT thora COTomy or a LEFT thora COSTomy? A: (Traumaid prefers) (a LEFT thora COTomy Here the set established by the question is restricted by the noun in the rheme of the answer to be a set of two thoracotomy procedures (both left and right  But which condition is a left THORACOSTOMY recommended for? A: A left THORACOSTOMY is recommended for the simple PNEUmothorax nIn the current implementation, such lexical stress shift is handled by identifying the lexical contrast properties in the alternative set representations and supplying separate pronunciations in the lexicon
