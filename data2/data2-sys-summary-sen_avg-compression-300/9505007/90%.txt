 Natural languages exhibit significant word order (WO) variation and intricate ordering rules Despite the fact that specific languages show less variation and complexity in such rules (e We have described a formalism which allows the grammar-writer to express complex WO rules in a language (including discontinuity) in a concise, modular and natural way EFOG extends the expressive power of the ID/LP format in both allowing complex LP rules and extending their domain of application 1992, Oliva 1992) in extending the domain of applicability of LP rules capability of stating concisely and declaratively WO rules in a way maximally approximating linguistic parlance in similar situations the separation of constituency rules from the rules pertaining to the linearization of these constituents (for there may be many, and diverse, reasons for wanting linearization (and constituency) rules easily modifiable, incl for 5 constituents, which may freely permute, the number of rules is 5! = 120  rules with fixed WO are transformed into free order ones by introducing special rules, containing symbols with no linguistic motivation, etc  Now assume we derive a sentence, applying rules (1) and (4  EFOG (Extended Flexible word Order Grammar) extends the expressive power of the ID/LP format In the immediate dominance part of rules EFOG has two types of constituents: non-contiguous (notated: #Node) and contiguous (notated just: Node where Node is some node accompanied by the dictionary rules: verb [amat  first(a, Node where Node is a node; e
