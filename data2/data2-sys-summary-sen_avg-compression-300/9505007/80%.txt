 Natural languages exhibit significant word order (WO) variation and intricate ordering rules Despite the fact that specific languages show less variation and complexity in such rules (e We have described a formalism which allows the grammar-writer to express complex WO rules in a language (including discontinuity) in a concise, modular and natural way EFOG extends the expressive power of the ID/LP format in both allowing complex LP rules and extending their domain of application using LP rules attached to each specific ID rule, rather than global ones, which unnecessarily proliferated the LP part of the grammar; or employing flattening rather than having non-contiguous grammar symbols to the same effect  1992, Oliva 1992) in extending the domain of applicability of LP rules capability of stating concisely and declaratively WO rules in a way maximally approximating linguistic parlance in similar situations the separation of constituency rules from the rules pertaining to the linearization of these constituents (for there may be many, and diverse, reasons for wanting linearization (and constituency) rules easily modifiable, incl Definite Clause Grammar, DCG, (Pereira Warren 1980 with their CF-style rules, are not modular (in the sense above so will have to specify explicitly each ordering of constituents in a separate rule, which results in an intolerably great number of rules in parsing a free WO language (e for 5 constituents, which may freely permute, the number of rules is 5! = 120  rules with fixed WO are transformed into free order ones by introducing special rules, containing symbols with no linguistic motivation, etc  1985 where the information, concerning constituency immediate dominance) and linear order, is separated, WO rules are concisely, declaratively and modularly expressed over the domain of local-trees (i It is important to note that in GPSG the linear precedence rules stated for a pair of sibling constituents should be valid for the whole set of grammar rules in which these constituents occur, and not just for some specific rule (this global empirical constraint on WO is called the Exhaustive Constant Partial Ordering (ECPO) property  Now assume we derive a sentence, applying rules (1) and (4  Hale 1981) show restrictions (Kashket 1987  EFOG (Extended Flexible word Order Grammar) extends the expressive power of the ID/LP format In the immediate dominance part of rules EFOG has two types of constituents: non-contiguous (notated: #Node) and contiguous (notated just: Node where Node is some node in EFOG notation (using a double arrow for ID rules, small case letters for constants and upper case ones for variables the grammar of the Latin sentence: Puella bona puerum parvum amat (good girl loves small boy grammatical in all its 120 permutations and, besides, having discontinuity in the noun phrases, we capture with the following structured EFOG rules with no WO restrictions: s #np(nom #vp accompanied by the dictionary rules: verb [amat  complex WO regularities, including both extremes  first(a, Node where Node is a node; e
