 The pattern matching capabilities of neural networks can be used to detect syntactic constituents of natural language The sentence is first decomposed into the broad syntactic categories pre-subject - subject - predicate by locating the subject At this stage the data is ready to present to the neural net The input to the net is derived from the candidate strings, the sequences of tags and hypertags Multi-layer networks, which can process linearly inseparable data, were also investigated, but are not necessary for this particular processing task The net is presented with training strings whose desired classification has been manually marked Then a neural net selects the string with the correct placement It then outlines the neural net selection process correct- A also requires that the words within the subject are correctly tagged The core process is data driven, as the parameters of the neural networks are derived from training text2 and 3 If both positive and negative data is used, counter examples will reduce the postulated grammar so that it is nearer the real grammar However, for some processing steps we need to reduce the number of candidate tag strings presented to the neural network to manageable proportions (see Section  The data must be pre-processed by filtering through the prohibition rule constraints If the number of candidate strings is within desirable bounds, such as for the head detection task, no rules are used Since data can be represented as higher order tuples, single layer networks can be used The most laborious part of this work is preparing the training data We run marked up training data through an early version of the network trained on the same data, so the results should be almost all correct Moreover, they can utilise more of the implicit information in the training data by modelling negative relationships (1) This parser has been trained to find the syntactic subject head that agrees in number with the main verb Other words are tagged using suffix information, or else defaults are invoked It will take a sentence, locate the subject and then find the head of the subject However, some words will have more than one possible tag Since there are 22 words (including punctuation ) the total number of strings would be  For instance, the subject must contain a noun-type word The grammatic framework alone does not reduce the number of candidate strings sufficiently for the subject detection stage These are adjacent tags which are not allowed, such as determiner - verb or start of subject - verb  By using these methods the number of candidate strings is drastically reduced
