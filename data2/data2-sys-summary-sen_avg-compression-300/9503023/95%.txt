 At this stage the data is ready to present to the neural net The net is presented with training strings whose desired classification has been manually marked It then outlines the neural net selection process0 Total time for training is measured in seconds correct- A also requires that the words within the subject are correctly tagged The core process is data driven, as the parameters of the neural networks are derived from training text However, for some processing steps we need to reduce the number of candidate tag strings presented to the neural network to manageable proportions (see Section  If the number of candidate strings is within desirable bounds, such as for the head detection task, no rules are used Since data can be represented as higher order tuples, single layer networks can be used (1) This parser has been trained to find the syntactic subject head that agrees in number with the main verb It will take a sentence, locate the subject and then find the head of the subject Since there are 22 words (including punctuation ) the total number of strings would be  The grammatic framework alone does not reduce the number of candidate strings sufficiently for the subject detection stage By using these methods the number of candidate strings is drastically reduced
