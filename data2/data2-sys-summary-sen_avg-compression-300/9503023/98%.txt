 At this stage the data is ready to present to the neural net The net is presented with training strings whose desired classification has been manually marked Then a neural net selects the string with the correct placement It then outlines the neural net selection process correct- A also requires that the words within the subject are correctly tagged The grammatic framework alone does not reduce the number of candidate strings sufficiently for the subject detection stage By using these methods the number of candidate strings is drastically reduced
