 The tool described in this paper performs tagset mapping with manually written rules to introduce a standardised morphosyntactic tagset Mapping tags of an existing, flat-labeled tagset or source annotation scheme to tags of a specification language (target annotation scheme) is an instance of the retagging problem In the latter case, the physical tagset makes finer distinctions than the target annotation scheme In the example case, the source annotation scheme includes special indefinite pronouns like anybody into the normal common nouns, whereas some word forms (color) are (wrongly tagged as adjectives in the source annotation scheme but as common nouns in the target annotation scheme We opted for symbolic mapping rules and designed two kinds of mapping rules to deal with the discrepancies indicated above Class coverage rules describe a correspondence of source and target annotation classes their standard mapping can be overridden in fig After the compilation of the mapping rules, the system keeps the information in a data structure called an MTree (mapping tree see fig There is an MTree for each physical tagset regarded nondisjunctiveness of classes: A target annotation class has several source annotation correspondences In fig section  For test purposes, we wrote mapping rules for the UPenn and SUSANNE tagsets
