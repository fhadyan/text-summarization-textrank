 An existing TFS has to be unified with a new one whose type is t The stack S is empty A VAR cell whose contents is a type t stands for the most general TFS of type t This function (which is automatically generated by the type hierarchy compiler) builds a TFS of the designated type on the heap, with VAR cells instead of REF cells for the features (DFS  Determining the values of these parameters is program-independent: the maintenance of the chart is fixed In addition, we described a compiler for a general TFS-based language The use of abstract machine techniques is expected to result in highly efficient processing The type is systematically omitted from type specifications
