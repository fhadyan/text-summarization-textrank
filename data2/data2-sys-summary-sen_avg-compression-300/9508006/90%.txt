 Transfer based approaches to machine translation (MT) involve three main phases: analysis, transfer and generation Such restrictions need to be incorporated in the monolingual lexical signs and rules Implementationally, bilexical rules may be applied off-line in order to expand the bilexicon before processing, or they may be applied during transfer to extend the bilexicon just sufficiently to enable transfer We now show how bi-lexical rules can be used in the translation of `thirsty basing our analysis on the classification of support verbs proposed by for English-French translation The analysis phase involves parsing the input sentence to produce an output bag or multiset of SL lexical signs instantiated with sufficient information to permit appropriate translation Information regarding which support verb a noun requires is encoded in its lexical entry Transfer maps these signs into a TL bag through the bilingual lexicon in which sets of source and target lexical signs are placed in translation correspondence There are other translation phenomena which can be described through the use of bi-lexical rules This concludes our overview of the different translation mismatches that may be handled through bi-lexical rules One possible solution is to manually add further bi-lexical rules which incorporate the bi-lexical rules In our proposed approach either the causative or the lexicalization pattern bi-lexical rule, or both, incorporate a context variable in their output bilexical entry We have introduced the mechanism of bi-lexical rules for incorporating lexical rules in MT These rules establish correspondences between bilexical entries such that given the presence of one entry, the existence of another bilexical entry can be inferred Future work could consider implementing Mel'cuk's lexical functions ( ( in a manner similar to the way bi-lexical rules were used in the translation of support verbs above  By using sets of lexical signs as their transfer representation, LMT systems can reduce the difficulties posed by structural mismatches between two languages, thus increasing the independence between source and target transfer representations One type of phenomena that leads to complex transfer in a number of systems may be called multi-lexical translation During Spanish bag generation, the appropriate support verb (i The third mechanism uses bilingual lexical rules to map bilexical entries into new bilexical entries Lexical rules may be thought of as establishing a relationship between lexical items such that given the presence of one lexical item in the lexicon the existence of a further item may be inferred A bi-lexical rule ( , ( takes a bilexical entry as input, and outputs a new bilexical entry Bi-lexical rules also serve to capture lexical, syntactic and semantic regularities in the translation between two languages by relating equivalent lexical processes cross-linguistically Consider the relationship that exists in English-Spanish translations between the translation of fruits and The relevant relationship may be described by the following bi-lexical rule: This bi-lexical rule says that if there is a bilexical entry translating English fruit nouns into Spanish fruit nouns, then there is a bilexical entry translating `noun tree' in English into a morphologically derived tree-denoting noun in Spanish
