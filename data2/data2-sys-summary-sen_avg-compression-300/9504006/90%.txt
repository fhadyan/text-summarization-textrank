 To do this it was necessary first to classify control shifts according to whether they resulted in shifts of topic1 Identifying topic shifts We identified topic shifts in the following way: Five judges were presented with the four dialogues and in each of the dialogues we had marked where control shifts occurred The judges were asked to state for each control shift whether it was accompanied by a topic shift2 Topic shift and type of control shift For interruptions, 90% occur within topic, i they do not result in topic shifts3 Other relations between topic and control Before the central shift, the client had control for more turns per topic and after it, the expert had control for more turns per topic With the exception of the first topic in Dialogues 1 and 4, the client has control of more turns in every topic before the central shift, whereas after it, the expert has control for more turns in every topic who produced the first utterance of each topic We also discovered a close relationship between topic initiation and topic dominance Using this parameter we identified three levels of structure in the dialogues: (a) control phases; (b) topic; and (c) global organisation For the control phases, we found that three types of utterances (prompts, repetitions and summaries) were consistently used to signal control shifts control phases cue words and phrases were not as reliable in predicting shifts We also examined how utterance type related to topic shift and found that few interruptions introduced a new topic2 Allocation of control in the dialogues We applied the control rules and found that control did not alternate from speaker to speaker on a turn by turn basis, but that there were long sequences of turns in which control remained with one speaker2 Reversions of control following vital facts In the following example, the client is already in control The analysis so far has been concerned with control shifts where shifts were identified from a series of rules which related utterance type and control
