 Examination of the dialogues indicated that there seemed to be different types of control shifts: after some shifts there seemed to be a change of topic, whereas for others the topic remained the same To do this it was necessary first to classify control shifts according to whether they resulted in shifts of topic1 Identifying topic shifts We identified topic shifts in the following way: Five judges were presented with the four dialogues and in each of the dialogues we had marked where control shifts occurred The judges were asked to state for each control shift whether it was accompanied by a topic shift2 Topic shift and type of control shift Analysing each type of control shift, it is clear that there are differences between the cues used for the topic shift and the no shift cases For interruptions, 90% occur within topic, i they do not result in topic shifts3 Other relations between topic and control We also looked at more general aspects of control within and between topics We found that each dialogue could be divided into two parts separated by a topic shift which we labelled the central shift Before the central shift, the client had control for more turns per topic and after it, the expert had control for more turns per topic The respective numbers of turns client and expert are in control before and after the central shift are :Before 11-7,22-8,12-6,21-6; After 12-33,16-23,2-11,0-5 for the four dialogues With the exception of the first topic in Dialogues 1 and 4, the client has control of more turns in every topic before the central shift, whereas after it, the expert has control for more turns in every topic who produced the first utterance of each topic We also discovered a close relationship between topic initiation and topic dominance In 19 of the 21 topics, the person who initiated the topic also had control of more turns As we might expect, the point at which the expert begins to have control over more turns per topic is also the point at which the expert begins to initiate new topics Using this parameter we identified three levels of structure in the dialogues: (a) control phases; (b) topic; and (c) global organisation For the control phases, we found that three types of utterances (prompts, repetitions and summaries) were consistently used to signal control shifts control phases cue words and phrases were not as reliable in predicting shifts We also examined how utterance type related to topic shift and found that few interruptions introduced a new topic2 Allocation of control in the dialogues We devised several rules to determine the location of control in the dialogues Each of these rules related control to utterance type: (a) For questions, the speaker was defined as being in control unless the question directly followed a question or command by the other conversant We applied the control rules and found that control did not alternate from speaker to speaker on a turn by turn basis, but that there were long sequences of turns in which control remained with one speaker This seemed to suggest that the dialogues were organised above the level of individual turns into phases where control was located with one speaker There was a total of 56 shifts of control over the 4 dialogues and we identified 3 main classes of cues used to signal control shifts These were prompts, repetitions and summaries1 Prompts On 21 of the 56 shifts (38 the utterance immediately prior to the control shift was a prompt (In the following examples a line indicates a control shift) Example 1 - Prompt Dialogue C - 33 Interruptions In the previous cases, the person controlling the dialogue gave a signal that control might be exchanged2 Reversions of control following vital facts In the following example, the client is already in control4 Cue reliability We also investigated whether there were occasions when prompts, repetitions and summaries failed to elicit the control shifts we predicted The analysis so far has been concerned with control shifts where shifts were identified from a series of rules which related utterance type and control
