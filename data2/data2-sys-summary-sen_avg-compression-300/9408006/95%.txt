 Moreover, an island may itself contain input which is unaccounted for by the grammar `ignore' rules may be invoked; 4 a local threshold level may be set in a rule to override the global threshold within that rule Only a rule defined this way can be invoked as an ignore rule in an RHS clause A rule name is a Prolog term, and only rules and terminal items may act as heads within a rule body If used in a rule body, they indicate that input is potentially ignored-the problems that ignore rules are intended to repair will not always occur, in which case the rules succeed without consuming any input There is a semantic restriction on the body of a rule which is that it must contain at least one clause which necessarily covers input (optional clauses and ignore rules do not necessarily cover input  The following is an example of a LHIP rule The chief modifications to the standard Prolog `grammar rule' format are of two types: one or more right-hand side (RHS) items may be marked as `heads and one or more RHS items may be marked as `ignorable  LHIP provides a number of ways of applying a grammar to input The simplest allows one to enumerate the possible analyses of the input with the grammar
