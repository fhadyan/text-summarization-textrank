e the node relations and type information) in the feature structure, so that the tree relations (left, right and parent) become features A simple bottom-up DATR representation for the whole tree (apart from the node type information) follows: Give: [cat] = v [parent cat] = vp [parent left cat] = np [parent parent cat] = s [right cat] = np [right right cat] = p [right right parent cat] = pp [right right right cat] = np VERB+NP: VERB [right] NPCOMP  VERB+NP+PP: VERB+NP [right right] PTREE [right right root] to VERB+NP+PP: [output dative right right] NPCOMP  For agentless passives, the necessary additions to the VERB+NP node are as follows: VERB+NP: [output passive form] passive [output passive right] [input passive right right]  Thus, for example, topicalisation and wh-questions can be defined as follows: VERB: [output topic parent parent parent cat] s [output topic parent parent left cat] np [output topic parent parent left form] normal [output whq] [output topic] [output whq parent parent left form] wh
