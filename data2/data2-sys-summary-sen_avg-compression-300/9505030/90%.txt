 Word2: Give [alt whq] true [alt dative] true [alt passive] true Our approach keeps all elementary trees, whether or not they have been partly defined by a lexical rule, entirely within the lexical hierarchy Second, we embed the resulting tree structure (ie the node relations and type information) in the feature structure, so that the tree relations (left, right and parent) become features A simple bottom-up DATR representation for the whole tree (apart from the node type information) follows: Give: [cat] = v [parent cat] = vp [parent left cat] = np [parent parent cat] = s [right cat] = np [right right cat] = p [right right parent cat] = pp [right right right cat] = np VERB+NP: VERB [right] NPCOMP  VERB+NP+PP: VERB+NP [right right] PTREE [right right root] to VERB+NP+NP: VERB+NP [right right] NPCOMP  Give: VERB+NP+PP [root] give NPCOMP: TREENODE [cat] np [type] substitution PTREE: TREENODE [cat] p [type] anchor [parent] PPTREE Here, TREENODE represents an abstract node in an LTAG tree and provides a (default) type of internal Lexical rules are specified by defining a derived output tree structure in terms of an input tree structure, where each of these structures is a set of feature specifications of the sort defined above So for example, the category of the parent tree node of the output of the passive rule might be referenced as [output passive parent cat  VERB+NP+PP: [output dative right right] NPCOMP  Subject-auxiliary inversion can be achieved similarly by just specifying the output tree structure without reference to the input structure (note the addition here of a form feature specifying verb form AUXVERB: [output auxinv form] finite-inv [output auxinv parent cat] s [output auxinv right cat] s For agentless passives, the necessary additions to the VERB+NP node are as follows: VERB+NP: [output passive form] passive [output passive right] [input passive right right]  Thus, for example, topicalisation and wh-questions can be defined as follows: VERB: [output topic parent parent parent cat] s [output topic parent parent left cat] np [output topic parent parent left form] normal [output whq] [output topic] [output whq parent parent left form] wh
