 The most severe result of insufficient training data is that some bins can go without any training instances For each bin, the probability that no training instances fall into it is: I will call such bins EMPTY BINS When bins are uniformly probable, the expected number of training instances in the same bin as a random test instance is (  In particular, an average of four training instances per bin can be expected to yield an error rate only 50% worse than the optimal error rate Error rates only 50% worse than optimal result from only three training instances per bin
