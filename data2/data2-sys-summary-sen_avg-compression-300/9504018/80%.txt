 It is common knowledge that a rational agent is inclined to presuppose the existence of definite references that occur in utterances They are embedded in a stratified logic framework in which quantifiers are taken under Lejewski's unrestricted interpretation The ontology is enhanced with the eight types of existence listed by Hirst , though in this paper, we will deal only with physical existence, represented as E unactualized existence, represented as , existence outside the world but with causal interaction with that world, EOW and existence in fiction, F  The study of presuppositions is primarily a study of commitment commitment to the existence of presupposed definite referents or to the truth of factive complements That definite references imply the existence of their referents constitutes another instance of defeasible inference (see examples (  This yields the following: Definition: Presuppositions are defeasible information that is derived from knowledge of language use and that is included in the most optimistic models of a theory described in terms of stratified logic under an unrestricted interpretation of the quantifiers If we know nothing about Buganda and its king, the complete theory of this utterance and the available knowledge in stratified logic is this: This theory has one optimistic model that reflects one's commitment to the king's existence The king's existence has the status of defeasible information; it is derived using knowledge of language use and is a presupposition of the utterance A complete formalization follows: For this theory, we obtain only one model schema: One can notice that the existential presupposition is now cancelled by some background knowledge Thus, the theory yields one model Asserting existence or nonexistence affects defeasible inferences due to knowledge of language use and restricts some of the models It is noteworthy that the inconsistency appears due to specific knowledge about the king's physical existence and not because of a quantification convention as in classical first-order logic Similarly, philosophers who have studied existence and nonexistence have been more concerned with providing formal tools for manipulation of nonexistent objects than tools to capture our commonsense commitment Its formalization in stratified logic follows: The optimistic model computed by our program is this: This model reflects our intuitions that Mary came to the party and all definite references exist The theory for the second sentence is this: This theory exhibits one optimistic model: Model m states that the object , being Pel, exists in a defeasible sense and this is the existential presupposition of the initial utterance As seen, it is needless to mention the existence of specific objects in the knowledge base In this way, the commitment to Pel's existence is preserved, and appears as a presupposition of the utterance Parsons's theory provides different logical forms for the above sentences, but fails to avoid the commitment to nonexistent objects From a philosophical perspective, we have quite a few theories which deal with existence and nonexistence, but they too offer no explanation for existential commitment The only difference is that this commitment is defeasible, so the model in which it is not acceptable to believe in the existence of the mountain will survive our core knowledge Among them, only one is minimal: the one that explains the commitment to both Ross's and Zeus's existence However, the optimistic model explains our commitment to Ross's existence Lejewski's unrestricted interpretation of the quantifiers, Hirst's ontology, and the notion of reasoning with stratified tableaux and model-ordering in stratified logic provide the formal tools to implement the principles This amounts to a model-theoretic definition for presuppositions that is able to offer a uniform treatment for linguistic presuppositions and an explanation for the existential commitment We first review the philosophical approaches in studying existence and nonexistence and the linguistic approaches in studying presuppositions, emphasizing their (in)ability to deal with presuppositions and nonexistence respectively150] that everything exists is not able to deal adequately with nonexistent objects Therefore, first-order logic is doomed to fail in any attempt to reflect the presuppositions of definite references Lejewski and Hintikka both propose an unrestricted interpretation of the quantifiers, which makes no commitment to the existence of the objects over which they range Under this interpretation, existence can be predicated (Lejewski or explicitly captured as (Hintikka  One can explicitly speak of nonexistence ( events and actions that do not occur ( existence at other times ( or fictional and imaginary objects (  The existential commitment is captured by a set of transparency axioms  For , this property entails the existence of its second argument in the physical world: Apparently, the commitment to Ross's existence is solved A simple ontology consisting only of existent and nonexistent objects is inadequate for dealing with fictions or objects that have unactualized existence In first-order stratified logic, a stratified interpretation consists of an universe of objects U and a function mapping Fas in first-order logic, but the relation set is partitioned according to the strength (undefeasible and defeasible relations) and polarity (positive and negative relations  Thus, the set of relations Rwill be given by the union where R[u] stands for positive undefeasible relations, for negative undefeasible relations, R[d]for positive defeasible relations, and for negative defeasible relations ) or undefeasible (e For example, a translation in stratified logic of the classical example involving Tweety (represented by the constant T) will yield three model schemata Computing the model schemata for a stratified theory can be done within the same complexity bounds as in first-order logic
