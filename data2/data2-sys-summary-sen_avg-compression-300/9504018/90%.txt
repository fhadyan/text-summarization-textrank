 The ontology is enhanced with the eight types of existence listed by Hirst , though in this paper, we will deal only with physical existence, represented as E unactualized existence, represented as , existence outside the world but with causal interaction with that world, EOW and existence in fiction, F  The study of presuppositions is primarily a study of commitment commitment to the existence of presupposed definite referents or to the truth of factive complements That definite references imply the existence of their referents constitutes another instance of defeasible inference (see examples (  If we know nothing about Buganda and its king, the complete theory of this utterance and the available knowledge in stratified logic is this: This theory has one optimistic model that reflects one's commitment to the king's existence The king's existence has the status of defeasible information; it is derived using knowledge of language use and is a presupposition of the utterance A complete formalization follows: For this theory, we obtain only one model schema: One can notice that the existential presupposition is now cancelled by some background knowledge Thus, the theory yields one model Asserting existence or nonexistence affects defeasible inferences due to knowledge of language use and restricts some of the models As seen, it is needless to mention the existence of specific objects in the knowledge base In this way, the commitment to Pel's existence is preserved, and appears as a presupposition of the utterance Parsons's theory provides different logical forms for the above sentences, but fails to avoid the commitment to nonexistent objects Among them, only one is minimal: the one that explains the commitment to both Ross's and Zeus's existence However, the optimistic model explains our commitment to Ross's existence We first review the philosophical approaches in studying existence and nonexistence and the linguistic approaches in studying presuppositions, emphasizing their (in)ability to deal with presuppositions and nonexistence respectively For , this property entails the existence of its second argument in the physical world: Apparently, the commitment to Ross's existence is solved A simple ontology consisting only of existent and nonexistent objects is inadequate for dealing with fictions or objects that have unactualized existence In first-order stratified logic, a stratified interpretation consists of an universe of objects U and a function mapping Fas in first-order logic, but the relation set is partitioned according to the strength (undefeasible and defeasible relations) and polarity (positive and negative relations  Thus, the set of relations Rwill be given by the union where R[u] stands for positive undefeasible relations, for negative undefeasible relations, R[d]for positive defeasible relations, and for negative defeasible relations ) or undefeasible (e
