 An agent constructs a referring expression plan by using the referent's most salient features Thus, referring expressions are represented as plan derivations, and an unsuccessful referring expression is an invalid plan in whose repair the agents collaborate If the recipient finds the initial referring expression plan invalid, then the agents will collaborate in its repair We take the referring expression plan itself to be the identification plan The mental actions in the plan will encode only useful descriptions If the overall confidence value exceeds some set value, the agent's confidence threshold, then the agent believes the plan is adequate So, the hierarchy is accessed during both plan construction and plan inference The agent constructs an initial referring expression plan in almost the same way as in Heeman and Hirst's system During plan inference, the salience hierarchy is used when evaluating a recognized plan Thus, judging the adequacy of a referring expression plan falls out of the regular plan evaluation process
