 To capture the fact that those primary occurrences are different from DSP's primary occurrences when dealing with ellipsis, we colour occurrences that are directly associated with focus (rather than a source parallel element in the case of ellipsis)  As before, the focus term is - and the FSV variable -coloured Second, a colour constant only unifies with itself Since -substitutions have two parts, a term- and a colour part, we need two kinds (M t]N for term equations and c c]d for colour equations  Given this, equation (1c) becomes (2a) with solutions (2b) and (2c) (primary occurrences are underlined e a term whose symbols are -coloured Given this coloured framework, the POR is directly modelled as follows: Primary occurrences are -coloured whilst free variables are -coloured ellipsis with focus phenomena (cf Given the above restriction for well-formed coloured substitutions, such a colouring ensures that any solution containing a primary occurrence is ruled out: free variables are -coloured and must be assigned a -monochrome term a -coloured symbol  In contrast to traditional (uncoloured) substitutions, a coloured substitution is a pair , where the term substitution maps coloured variables (i the pair of a variable x and the colour c) to formulae of the appropriate type and the colour substitution maps colour variables to colours If is a colour constant, then is -monochrome The second condition formalizes the fact that free variables with constant colours stand for monochrome subformulae, whereas colour variables do not constrain the substitutions
