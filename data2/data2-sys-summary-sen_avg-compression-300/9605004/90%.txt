 To capture the fact that those primary occurrences are different from DSP's primary occurrences when dealing with ellipsis, we colour occurrences that are directly associated with focus (rather than a source parallel element in the case of ellipsis)  not just source parallel elements) are taken to be primary occurrences As before, the focus term is - and the FSV variable -coloured Given these assumptions, the representation for (10) is and the corresponding FSV equation has two possible solutions In contrast, the representation for (11) is and the equation is with only one well-coloured solution Importantly, given the indicated colour constraints, no other solutions are admissible Second, a colour constant only unifies with itself Since -substitutions have two parts, a term- and a colour part, we need two kinds (M t]N for term equations and c c]d for colour equations  The variable elimination process for colour variables is very simple, it allows to transform a set of equations to , making the equation solved in the result Similarly, in the second equation, the projection binding for H[2] solves the equation, while the second projection clashes and the imitation binding is not -monochrome To remedy this shortcoming, DSP propose an informal restriction, the Primary Occurrence Restriction: Given a labeling of occurrences as either primary or secondary, the POR excludes of the set of linguistically valid solutions, any solution which contains a primary occurrence Here, a primary occurrence is an occurrence that is directly associated with a source parallel element Given this, equation (1c) becomes (2a) with solutions (2b) and (2c) (primary occurrences are underlined  This framework uses a variant of the simply typed -calculus where symbol occurrences can be annotated with so-called colours and substitutions must obey the following constraint: For any colour constant and any -coloured variable , a well-formed coloured substitution must assign to a -monochrome term ie a term whose symbols are -coloured Given this coloured framework, the POR is directly modelled as follows: Primary occurrences are -coloured whilst free variables are -coloured ellipsis with focus phenomena (cf Given the above restriction for well-formed coloured substitutions, such a colouring ensures that any solution containing a primary occurrence is ruled out: free variables are -coloured and must be assigned a -monochrome term a -coloured symbol  In contrast, (3d) is not a possible solution since it assigns to an -coloured variable, a term containing a -coloured symbol i In contrast to traditional (uncoloured) substitutions, a coloured substitution is a pair , where the term substitution maps coloured variables (i the pair of a variable x and the colour c) to formulae of the appropriate type and the colour substitution maps colour variables to colours If is a colour constant, then is -monochrome section  The second condition formalizes the fact that free variables with constant colours stand for monochrome subformulae, whereas colour variables do not constrain the substitutions Note that -reduction in the coloured -calculus is just the classical notion, since the bound variables do not carry colour information
