 To capture the fact that those primary occurrences are different from DSP's primary occurrences when dealing with ellipsis, we colour occurrences that are directly associated with focus (rather than a source parallel element in the case of ellipsis)  not just source parallel elements) are taken to be primary occurrences Given some standard assumptions about the semantics of always, the equations constraining the interpretation An of this anaphor are: Consider the first equation The HOCU algorithm is augmented with suitable rules for boolean constraint satisfaction for colour equations The equations resulting from the interpretation of (9b) are: where the first equation determines the interpretation of the ellipsis whereas the second fixes the value of the FSV Resolution of the first equation yields the value for  As required, no other solution is possible given the colour constraints; in particular is not a valid solution The value of is now so that the second equation is: Under the indicated colour constraints, three solutions are possible: The first solution yields a narrow focus reading (only SARAH is in focus) whereas the second and the third yield wide focus interpretations corresponding to a VP and an S focus respectively In essence, the main function of the POR is to ensure that some occurrence occuring in an equation appears as a bound variable in the term assigned by substitution to the free variable occurring in this equation However, there are cases where the dual constraint must be enforced: a term occurrence appearing in an equation must appear unchanged in the term assigned by substitution to the free variable occurring in this equation anaphors and ellipses) are represented by free variables whose value is determined by solving higher-order equations As before, the focus term is - and the FSV variable -coloured Furthermore, we assume that pronouns that are preceded and c-commanded by a quantified/wh/focused antecedent are variable coloured whereas other pronouns are -coloured Given these assumptions, the representation for (10) is and the corresponding FSV equation has two possible solutions In contrast, the representation for (11) is and the equation is with only one well-coloured solution Importantly, given the indicated colour constraints, no other solutions are admissible First, the definition of coloured substitutions ensures that the term assigned to is -monochrome In particular, this forces any occurrences of to appear as a bound variable in the value assigned to whereas can appear either as (a colour variable unifies with any colour constant) or as a bound variable - this in effect models the sloppy/strict ambiguity Second, a colour constant only unifies with itself Since -substitutions have two parts, a term- and a colour part, we need two kinds (M t]N for term equations and c c]d for colour equations  Furthermore equations are kept in -normal form The variable elimination process for colour variables is very simple, it allows to transform a set of equations to , making the equation solved in the result In their treatment of VP-ellipsis, DSP introduce an informal restriction to avoid over-generation: the Primary Occurrence Restriction (POR  Similarly, in the second equation, the projection binding for H[2] solves the equation, while the second projection clashes and the imitation binding is not -monochrome To remedy this shortcoming, DSP propose an informal restriction, the Primary Occurrence Restriction: Given a labeling of occurrences as either primary or secondary, the POR excludes of the set of linguistically valid solutions, any solution which contains a primary occurrence Here, a primary occurrence is an occurrence that is directly associated with a source parallel element Given this, equation (1c) becomes (2a) with solutions (2b) and (2c) (primary occurrences are underlined  Since (2c) contains a primary occurrence, it is ruled out by the POR and is thus excluded from the set of linguistically valid solutions There is a restricted form of HOU which allows for a natural modeling of DSP's Primary Occurrence Restriction: Higher-Order Coloured Unification developed independently for theorem proving  This framework uses a variant of the simply typed -calculus where symbol occurrences can be annotated with so-called colours and substitutions must obey the following constraint: For any colour constant and any -coloured variable , a well-formed coloured substitution must assign to a -monochrome term ie a term whose symbols are -coloured In this paper, we argue that Higher-Order Coloured Unification (HOCU, (cf Given this coloured framework, the POR is directly modelled as follows: Primary occurrences are -coloured whilst free variables are -coloured ellipsis with focus phenomena (cf Given the above restriction for well-formed coloured substitutions, such a colouring ensures that any solution containing a primary occurrence is ruled out: free variables are -coloured and must be assigned a -monochrome term Hence no substitution will ever contain a primary occurrence (i a -coloured symbol  In contrast, (3d) is not a possible solution since it assigns to an -coloured variable, a term containing a -coloured symbol i To be more formal, we presuppose a finite set of colour constants and a countably infinite supply of colour variables In particular we assume that free variables are coloured in all formulae occuring This observation leads to the notion of coloured substitutions, that takes the colour information of formulae into account In contrast to traditional (uncoloured) substitutions, a coloured substitution is a pair , where the term substitution maps coloured variables (i the pair of a variable x and the colour c) to formulae of the appropriate type and the colour substitution maps colour variables to colours the colour erasures have to be equal If is a colour constant, then is -monochrome section  The second condition formalizes the fact that free variables with constant colours stand for monochrome subformulae, whereas colour variables do not constrain the substitutions Note that -reduction in the coloured -calculus is just the classical notion, since the bound variables do not carry colour information In the coloured -calculus the space of (semantic) solutions is further constrained by requiring the solutions to be -substitutionst focus semantics but not wt to VP-ellipsis interpretation  Fortunately, the HOCU framework is just this: different colours can be used for different types of primary occurrences and likewise for different types of free variables
