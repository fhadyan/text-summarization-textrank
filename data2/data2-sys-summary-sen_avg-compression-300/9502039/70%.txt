 Today, the problem is quiet different Tagging sentences with the name of their language solves this problem by switching each application in function of the language Grammatical words are proper to each language and are in a whole different from one language to another So, these words can be use as discriminant of language But can we use them as discriminant of sentences? Grammatical words in sentences represent on average about 50% of words Furthermore, relying on grammatical words allows textual errors tolerance and foreign words import from other languages (usual in scientific texts  It's also important to note that foreign words import concerns nouns, verbs, adjectives but never grammatical words These rules will allow us to categorize sentences which have enough grammatical words but in short sentences (less than 10 words there are few grammatical words, and by the way, few clues We must introduce new knowledges to improve short sentences categorization We can also remark that using grammatical words is different from using most common words The number of words to hold is quiet subjective Moreover, frequency is relative to texts, not to sentences There are two levels to improve sentences categorization: a level below using words morphology and a level above using text structure Mainly two ways can be explore to improve categorization, using natural languages properties: Syllabation: the idea is to check the good syllabation of words in a language When dealing with texts, we can also use heuristical knowledge about text structure: In a same paragraph, contiguous sentences are written in the same language Titles of a paragraph are written in the same language as their body Included blocks in a sentence (via parenthesis, are written in the same language as the sentence To manage the possible points of change of language via included segments (see section the language classification procedure uses a recursive algorithm to easily handle changes of context The classification principle is the following: For each word of the sentence: Checked whether the word belongs to the grammatical words list of some languages We use dictionnaries to get the grammatical words of each language (see table ) and their alphabet They express the fact that a sentence is usually written with grammatical words and that grammatical words are totally discriminant for sentences of more than 8 words Deductions really start between 4 and 6 words Here, sentences and grammatical words appear but in few quantities to allow a perfect deduction In table , with the french corpus, the program always succeeds in isolating a single language for all the sentences containing from 8 to 125 words Isolating a single language does not mean exactly isolating the right language01% and concerns very short sentences ( e mail where e is analysed as Spanish a change of language without quotes in a sentence or an unexpected language (the Latin Orbi et Urbi
