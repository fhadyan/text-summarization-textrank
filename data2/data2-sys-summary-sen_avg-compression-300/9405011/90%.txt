 In collaborative expert-consultation dialogues, two participants (executing agent and consultant) work together to construct a plan for achieving the executing agent's domain goal The belief level captures domain-related beliefs proposed by discourse actions as well as the relationship amongst them Figure outlines the dialogue model for utterances ( ) with the additional belief level The evaluation process starts at the proposed domain level Our system can initiate subdialogues to negotiate implicitly proposed additions to the shared plan, can appropriately respond to user queries that are motivated by ill-formed or suboptimal solutions, and handles in a unified manner the negotiation of proposed domain actions, proposed problem-solving actions, and beliefs proposed by discourse actions The system is presented with the existing dialogue model and the actions proposed by the user's new utterances The domain level contains the domain plan being constructed for later execution The problem-solving level contains the agents' intentions about how to construct the domain plan, and the discourse level contains the communicative plan initiated to further their joint problem-solving intentions Each utterance by a participant constitutes a proposal intended to affect the shared model of domain, problem-solving, and discourse intentions shared plans in a collaborative planning process, we separate the dialogue model into an existing model, which consists of a shared plan agreed upon by both agents, and the proposed additions, which contain newly inferred actions A proposal consists of a chain of actions for addition to the shared plan Our system maintains a user model that includes the user's preferences The preferences are represented in the form, prefers user, _attribute object, _value _action, _strength which indicates that _user has a _strength preference that the attribute _attribute of _object be _value when performing _action Suppose that the evaluator must determine whether an action Ai (in a chain of proposed actions ) is the best way of performing its parent action Ai+1 Figure shows the relevant domain knowledge and user model information The model treats utterances as proposals open for negotiation and only incorporates a proposal into the shared plan under construction if both agents believe the proposal to be appropriate Each specialization eventually decomposes into some primitive action which modifies the proposal Figure illustrates the dialogue model that would result from the following utterances (5) Who is teaching AI? The evaluation process, which determines whether or not to accept the proposal, starts at the top-level proposed domain action, Satisfy-Seminar-Course(U,CS  The Inform action further decomposes into two actions, one which tells the user of the belief, and one which provides support for the claim
