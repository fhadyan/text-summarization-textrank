 The belief level captures domain-related beliefs proposed by discourse actions as well as the relationship amongst them The evaluation process starts at the proposed domain level Our system can initiate subdialogues to negotiate implicitly proposed additions to the shared plan, can appropriately respond to user queries that are motivated by ill-formed or suboptimal solutions, and handles in a unified manner the negotiation of proposed domain actions, proposed problem-solving actions, and beliefs proposed by discourse actions The system is presented with the existing dialogue model and the actions proposed by the user's new utterances The domain level contains the domain plan being constructed for later execution The problem-solving level contains the agents' intentions about how to construct the domain plan, and the discourse level contains the communicative plan initiated to further their joint problem-solving intentions shared plans in a collaborative planning process, we separate the dialogue model into an existing model, which consists of a shared plan agreed upon by both agents, and the proposed additions, which contain newly inferred actions A proposal consists of a chain of actions for addition to the shared plan Our system maintains a user model that includes the user's preferences Figure shows the relevant domain knowledge and user model information Each specialization eventually decomposes into some primitive action which modifies the proposal
