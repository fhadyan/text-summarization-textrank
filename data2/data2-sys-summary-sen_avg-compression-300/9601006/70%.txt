 Possessive pronouns are often used as determiners in English when no equivalent would be used in a Japanese sentence with the same meaning 657 noun phrases containing possessive pronouns were found in the translations In contrast, a possessive pronoun is generated in example ( ) where there is no definite article generated Examining the test set showed that the meanings of verbs can be used to determine whether a possessive pronoun should be generated or not for noun phrases headed by trigger-nouns In the test set, noun phrases denoting KIN or BODY PARTS are modified by possessive pronouns used deictically when they are the subject of the sentence The proposed method for appropriately generating possessive pronouns for the remaining 48% is presented in Section  All save two of the 168 noun phrases in group I,in which the original Japanese contained an explicit possessive expression, are translated correctly For the 105 noun phrases in group II, in which a possessive pronoun is required by an English expression in the human's translation but there is no possessive expression in the Japanese, ALT-J/E did not always select the same expression as the human translator There were 825 noun phrases in the test set headed by trigger-nouns The evaluation was conducted by comparing the machine generated translation of the noun phrases headed by trigger-nouns with the human translations 429 (57 of the noun phrases headed by trigger-nouns do not require a possessive pronoun to be generated by the proposed method These noun phrases are all translated correctly by the `93 version as it has no special processing for generating possessive pronouns It fails, however, to generate possessive pronouns when they are judged as necessary in the remaining 323 noun phrases (43  In the '94 version, using the proposed method, noun phrases are generated when wanted 80% of the time (the number of noun phrases with appropriate possessive pronouns generated (263) over the number of noun phrases where a possessive pronoun was judged appropriate (323  The proposed method, however, introduces a new source of errors, over-generation of possessive pronouns Possessive pronouns are inappropriately generated for 83 noun phrases headed by trigger-nouns (11% of the total number  We make it easier to correct for this during post-editing by tagging possessive pronouns generated by the proposed method as being less reliable than possessive pronouns generated from directly from possessive expressions in the source text or transfer patterns In order to examine when possessive pronouns should be generated when translating between Japanese and English 6,200 Japanese sentences with English translations were examined 657 examples of noun phrases containing possessive pronouns were found in the human translations A heuristic method for appropriately generating possessive pronouns for the remaining 54% was proposed It increased the number of noun phrases with appropriate possessive pronouns generated by 263 to 609, but at the cost of generating 83 noun phrases with inappropriate possessive pronouns We intend to increase the number of appropriate possessive pronouns generated by resolving rule conflicts and to reduce the number of inappropriate possessive pronouns generated by adding more semantic constraints The English translations of the test set contain 657 noun phrases with possessive pronouns The sentences containing these noun phrases were examined in order to determine how the possessive pronouns could be generated by a machine translation system There were 193 noun phrases (30 in the first group (I) where the original Japanese noun phrase contains a possessive expression, either a pronoun or the reflexive jibun `self' followed by the genitive postposition no `of' that indicates possession The genitive pronoun construction ( PRONOUN-no) can be directly translated into English as a possessive pronoun jibun-no is translated as POSSESSIVE PRONOUN own The second group (II with 105 noun phrases (16 consisted of those in which the possessive pronoun appeared as part of an English expression where both the use of a possessive pronoun and its antecedent could be deduced from the form of the expression, but there was no equivalent possessive construction in the Japanese original sentence An expression may be based on a verb, as in sentence ( ) where the Japanese idiom chie-o shiboru `wring knowledge' is translated into an English idiom rack POSSESSIVE PRONOUN brains in which the antecedent of the possessive pronoun is the noun phrase that is the subject of the verbal idiom The use of possessive pronouns with the nouns which head the noun phrases in group III seems to be tied to the particular words assailant, partner, subordinate) were commonly translated with possessive pronouns They headed 825 noun phrases The human translations of 355 out of the 825 noun phrases headed by trigger-nouns (43 contained possessive pronouns, even though the original Japanese did not contain a possessive construction, and the possessive pronoun was not part of an English expression in which it was obligatory The problem of generating possessive pronouns as determiners in translation where there is no equivalent in the Japanese has not previously been addressed; it requires not only contextual information such as that used to determine noun phrase referentiality, but also information about the conventional usage of possessive pronouns in English This section describes the overall process of translation in ALT-J/E, and in particular how the possessive pronouns in noun phrases from groups (I) and (II) are translated Noun phrases in group I, where the Japanese contains a possessive expression are directly translated at the beginning of the (sixth) transfer stage In this paper, we propose a method of generating possessive pronouns as determiners for noun phrases where there is no equivalent in the Japanese, based on treating information about the conventional use of possessive pronouns in English as a lexical property of nouns The translation rules for English expressions with obligatory possessive pronouns identify the antecedent within the rule This section describes the proposed method for appropriately generating possessive pronouns for noun phrases headed by trigger nouns The original version (hereafter the '93 version) does not use the proposed method for generating possessive pronouns The generation of possessive pronouns in noun phrases headed by trigger-nouns occurs at the end of the transfer phrase We shall call the pronouns generated for these noun phrases `default possessive pronouns' because they are generated as a default, not as a result of being explicitly indicated in the Japanese or in the translation pattern First, the noun phrase's referential property is determined as described in Section  If the noun phrase's determiner slot is already filled, then it cannot have a possessive pronoun In sentence ( ) the subject nose is determined by the human translator to have generic reference and no possessive pronoun is used In general, noun phrases with generic reference are not modified by possessive pronouns Similarly, noun phrases used ascriptively, to ascribe an attribute to another noun phrase, do not use possessive pronouns, e That is a big nose! Therefore, we restrict the problem of determining when possessive phrases should be used to referential noun phrases In sentence ( the '93 version does not differentiate between generic and referential noun phrases Generic noun phrases headed by countable nouns are translated as bare plurals and are not candidates for the generation of default possessive pronouns Therefore, as nose is a trigger-noun a possessive pronoun with deictic reference is generated Default possessive pronouns will not be generated if the determiner slot has been filled
