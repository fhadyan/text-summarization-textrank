 The semantic contribution of the pronoun is, then, a formula that consumes the meaning of its antecedent and then reintroduces that meaning, simultaneously assigning it to its own semantic projection: In other words, the semantic contribution of a pronoun copies the meaning X of its antecedent as the meaning of the pronoun itself LFG assumes two syntactic levels of representation: constituent structure (c-structure) represents phrasal dominance and precedence relations, while functional structure (f-structure) represents syntactic predicate-argument structure Our approach exploits the f-structure of LFG for syntactic information needed to guide semantic composition, and also exploits the resource-sensitive properties of linear logic to express the semantic composition requirements of natural language For example, the f-structure for sentence is given in  The meaning language is based on Montague's intensional higher-order logic The glue language refers to three kinds of terms: meaning terms, f-structures, and semantic or -structures The syntactic information given in lexical entries consists of equality statements about the f-structure, while the semantic information consists of assertions about how the meaning of the f-structure participates in various semantic relations The semantic information in a lexical entry, which we will call the semantic contribution of the entry, is a linear-logic formula that constrains the association between semantic structures projected from the f-structures mentioned in the lexical entry , and their semantic interpretations The semantic projection function maps an f-structure to a semantic structure encoding information about its meaning, in the same way as the functional projection function maps c-structure nodes to the associated f-structures We can now explain the semantic contributions in  Specifically, if f is the f-structure for a clause with predicate ( ) `appoint the semantic contribution asserts that if f's subject has meaning X and (linear conjunction ) f's object has meaning Y, then (linear implication ) f has meaning  F-structures provide a crosslinguistically uniform representation of syntactic information relevant to semantic interpretation that abstracts away from the details of phrase structure and linear order in particular languages The generalized quantifier meaning of a natural language determiner has the following type, a function from two properties, the quantifier's restriction and scope, to a proposition: At the semantic glue level, we can understand that type as follows Given those entries, the semantic contributions of every and voter in are From these two premises, the semantic contribution for every voter follows: The propositional part of this contribution corresponds to the standard type for noun phrase meanings,  Informally, the whole contribution can be read as follows: if by giving the arbitrary meaning x of type e to the argument position filled by the noun phrase we can derive the meaning S x of type tfor the semantic structure scope of quantification H, then S can be the property that the noun phrase meaning requires as its scope, yielding the meaning for H
