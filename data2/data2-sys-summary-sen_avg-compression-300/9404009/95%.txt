 The semantic contribution of the pronoun is, then, a formula that consumes the meaning of its antecedent and then reintroduces that meaning, simultaneously assigning it to its own semantic projection: In other words, the semantic contribution of a pronoun copies the meaning X of its antecedent as the meaning of the pronoun itself LFG assumes two syntactic levels of representation: constituent structure (c-structure) represents phrasal dominance and precedence relations, while functional structure (f-structure) represents syntactic predicate-argument structure Our approach exploits the f-structure of LFG for syntactic information needed to guide semantic composition, and also exploits the resource-sensitive properties of linear logic to express the semantic composition requirements of natural language The glue language refers to three kinds of terms: meaning terms, f-structures, and semantic or -structures The syntactic information given in lexical entries consists of equality statements about the f-structure, while the semantic information consists of assertions about how the meaning of the f-structure participates in various semantic relations The semantic information in a lexical entry, which we will call the semantic contribution of the entry, is a linear-logic formula that constrains the association between semantic structures projected from the f-structures mentioned in the lexical entry , and their semantic interpretations The semantic projection function maps an f-structure to a semantic structure encoding information about its meaning, in the same way as the functional projection function maps c-structure nodes to the associated f-structures
