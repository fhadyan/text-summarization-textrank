 The glue language refers to three kinds of terms: meaning terms, f-structures, and semantic or -structures The syntactic information given in lexical entries consists of equality statements about the f-structure, while the semantic information consists of assertions about how the meaning of the f-structure participates in various semantic relations The semantic information in a lexical entry, which we will call the semantic contribution of the entry, is a linear-logic formula that constrains the association between semantic structures projected from the f-structures mentioned in the lexical entry , and their semantic interpretations
