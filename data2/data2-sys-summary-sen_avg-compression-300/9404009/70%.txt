 This paper describes part of our ongoing investigation on the use of formal deduction in linear logic to explicate the relationship between syntactic analyses in Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) and semantic interpretations Before we look at quantifier scope ambiguity and interactions between scope and bound anaphora, we demonstrate the basic operation of our proposed representation of the semantic contribution of a determiner We use the following sentence with a single quantifier and no scope ambiguities: The premises for the derivation are the semantic contributions for Bill and convinced together with the contribution derived above for the quantified noun phrase every voter: Giving the name bill-convinced to the formula we have the derivation: No derivation of a different formula is possible The formula bill-convinced represents the semantics of the scope of the determiner `every  When a sentence contains more than one quantifier, scope ambiguities are of course possible Scope ambiguities are manifested in two different ways in our system: through the choice of different semantic structures H, corresponding to different syntactic choices for where to scope the quantifier, or through different relative orders of quantifiers that scope at the same point Intuitively, this noun phrase may not take wider scope than the quantifier every candidate, on which its restriction depends The semantic contribution of the pronoun is, then, a formula that consumes the meaning of its antecedent and then reintroduces that meaning, simultaneously assigning it to its own semantic projection: In other words, the semantic contribution of a pronoun copies the meaning X of its antecedent as the meaning of the pronoun itself Since the left-hand side of the linear implication consumes the antecedent meaning, it must be reinstated in the consequent of the implication LFG assumes two syntactic levels of representation: constituent structure (c-structure) represents phrasal dominance and precedence relations, while functional structure (f-structure) represents syntactic predicate-argument structure Our approach exploits the f-structure of LFG for syntactic information needed to guide semantic composition, and also exploits the resource-sensitive properties of linear logic to express the semantic composition requirements of natural language The use of linear logic as the glue language in a deductive semantic framework allows a natural treatment of quantification which automatically gives the right results for quantifier scope ambiguities and interactions with bound anaphora The analyses discussed here show that our linear-logic encoding of semantic compositionality captures the interpretation constraints between quantified noun phrases, their scopes and bound anaphora For example, the f-structure for sentence is given in  The meaning language is based on Montague's intensional higher-order logic Note that we allow variables in the glue language to range over meaning terms The glue language refers to three kinds of terms: meaning terms, f-structures, and semantic or -structures These two phrase structure rules do not encode semantic information; they specify only how grammatical functions such as are expressed in English The relation between the nodes of the c-structure and the f-structure for the sentence is expressed by means of arrows in (1 Unlike phrase structure rules, lexical entries specify semantic as well as syntactic information The syntactic information given in lexical entries consists of equality statements about the f-structure, while the semantic information consists of assertions about how the meaning of the f-structure participates in various semantic relations The semantic information in a lexical entry, which we will call the semantic contribution of the entry, is a linear-logic formula that constrains the association between semantic structures projected from the f-structures mentioned in the lexical entry , and their semantic interpretations The semantic projection function maps an f-structure to a semantic structure encoding information about its meaning, in the same way as the functional projection function maps c-structure nodes to the associated f-structures We will see, however, that f-structures and their semantic projections must be distinguished, because in general semantic projections carry more information than just the association to the meaning for the corresponding f-structure We can now explain the semantic contributions in  Those accounts therefore force the adoption of categorial syntactic analyses, with their strong dependence on phrase structure and linear order If a particular occurrence of `Bill' in a sentence is associated with f-structure f, the syntactic constraint in the lexical entry Bill will be instantiated as and the semantic constraint will be instantiated as , representing the association between and the constant representing its meaning The semantic contribution of the appointed entry is more complex, as it relates the meanings of the subject and object of a clause to the clause's meaning Specifically, if f is the f-structure for a clause with predicate ( ) `appoint the semantic contribution asserts that if f's subject has meaning X and (linear conjunction ) f's object has meaning Y, then (linear implication ) f has meaning  In the semantic contribution for appointed in , the linear-logic connectives of multiplicative conjunction and linear implication are used to specify how the meaning of a clause headed by the verb is composed from the meanings of the arguments of the verb In contrast, our approach uses linear logic to represent the connection between two dissimilar levels of representation, LFG f-structures and their semantic interpretations The glue language, described below, is a fragment of linear logic The semantic contribution of each lexical entry is represented by a linear-logic formula that can be understood as instructions in the glue language for combining the meanings of the lexical entry's syntactic arguments into the meaning of the f-structure headed by the entry F-structures provide a crosslinguistically uniform representation of syntactic information relevant to semantic interpretation that abstracts away from the details of phrase structure and linear order in particular languages Instead, the semantic contributions are occurrences of information which are generated and used exactly once For example, the formula can be thought of as providing one occurrence of the meaning associated to the semantic projection  That meaning must be consumed exactly once (for example, by appointed in ) in the derivation of a meaning of the entire utterance It is this resource-sensitivity of natural language semantics an expression is used exactly once in a semantic derivation that linear logic can model As notes, however, the flatter, unordered, grammatical function structure of LFG does not fit well with traditional semantic compositionality, based on functional abstraction and application, which mandates a rigid order of semantic composition This undirected version of the Lambek calculus was developed by van Benthem to account for the semantic combination possibilities of phrase meanings Those systems and related ones , , were developed as calculi of syntactic/semantic types, with propositional formulas representing syntactic categories or semantic types The extraction of meanings from derivations following the Curry-Howard isomorphism that is standard in categorial systems demands that the order of syntactic combination coincide with the order of semantic combination so that functor-argument relations at the syntactic and semantic level are properly aligned The generalized quantifier meaning of a natural language determiner has the following type, a function from two properties, the quantifier's restriction and scope, to a proposition: At the semantic glue level, we can understand that type as follows It turns out that linear logic offers exactly what is required for a calculus of semantic composition for LFG, in that it can represent directly the constraints on the creation and use of semantic units in sentence interpretation without forcing a particular hierarchical order of composition except as required by the properties of particular lexical entries Assume that we have determined the following semantic structures: for the restriction (a common noun phrase for its implicit argument, for the scope of quantification, and for the grammatical function filled by the quantified noun phrase In addition to providing a semantic type assignment for determiners, uses glue language quantification to express how the meanings of the restriction and scope of quantification are determined and combined into the meaning of the quantified clause The condition We first demonstrate how the semantic contribution of a quantified noun phrase such as every voter is derived The f-structure for the noun phrase every voter is: The semantic contributions of common nouns and determiners were described in the previous section Given those entries, the semantic contributions of every and voter in are From these two premises, the semantic contribution for every voter follows: The propositional part of this contribution corresponds to the standard type for noun phrase meanings,  Informally, the whole contribution can be read as follows: if by giving the arbitrary meaning x of type e to the argument position filled by the noun phrase we can derive the meaning S x of type tfor the semantic structure scope of quantification H, then S can be the property that the noun phrase meaning requires as its scope, yielding the meaning for H
