 The acquisition of case frame patterns normally involves the following three subproblems: 1) Extracting case frames from corpus data, 2) Generalizing case frame slots within these case frames, 3) Learning dependencies that exist between these generalized case frame slots We generalized the case slots within each of these case frames using the method proposed by to obtain class-based case slots, and then replaced the word-based case slots in the data with the obtained class-based case slots We found that no two case slots are determined as dependent in any of the case frame patterns For the slot-based model, sometimes case slots are found to be dependentIsotani of NEC Information Technology Res In this paper, we propose a method of learning dependencies between case frame slots These examples indicate that the possible values of case slots depend in general on those of the other case slots: that is, there exist `dependencies' between different case slots Since many of the random variables (case slots) in case frame patterns are essentially independent, this feature is crucial in our context, and we thus employ Suzuki's algorithm for learning our case frame patterns
