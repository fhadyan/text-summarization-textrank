 We address the problem of automatically acquiring case frame patterns (selectional patterns) from large corpus data The acquisition of case frame patterns normally involves the following three subproblems: 1) Extracting case frames from corpus data, 2) Generalizing case frame slots within these case frames, 3) Learning dependencies that exist between these generalized case frame slots (The bracketed corpus does overlap with part of the tagged corpus We acquired case frame patterns using the training data In this paper, we view the problem of learning case frame patterns as that of learning a multi-dimensional discrete joint distribution, where random variables represent case slots We then formalize the dependencies between case slots as the probabilistic dependencies between these random variables We also used the 357 verbs and their case frames used in Experiment 1 to acquire class-based case frame patterns using the proposed method We generalized the case slots within each of these case frames using the method proposed by to obtain class-based case slots, and then replaced the word-based case slots in the data with the obtained class-based case slots We found that no two case slots are determined as dependent in any of the case frame patterns For the slot-based model, sometimes case slots are found to be dependent We proposed to use dependency forests to represent case frame patterns for his comments We employ Suzuki's algorithm to learn case frame patterns as dendroid distributions In this paper, we propose a method of learning dependencies between case frame slots In this paper, we use `case slots' to mean surface case slots, and we uniformly treat obligatory cases and optional cases By `dependency' is meant the relation that exists between case slots which constrains the possible values assumed by each of those case slots Assuming that random variables (case slots) are mutually independent would drastically reduce the number of parameters These examples indicate that the possible values of case slots depend in general on those of the other case slots: that is, there exist `dependencies' between different case slots Since many of the random variables (case slots) in case frame patterns are essentially independent, this feature is crucial in our context, and we thus employ Suzuki's algorithm for learning our case frame patterns We used the case frames of all 357 verbs as our training data
