 We generalized the case slots within each of these case frames using the method proposed by to obtain class-based case slots, and then replaced the word-based case slots in the data with the obtained class-based case slots We found that no two case slots are determined as dependent in any of the case frame patterns For the slot-based model, sometimes case slots are found to be dependent We proposed to use dependency forests to represent case frame patterns
