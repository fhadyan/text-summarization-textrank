 Recognizer score + linguistic KSs 3 It is apparent that nearly all of the improvement is coming from the linguistic KSs; the difference between the lines recognizer + linguistic KSs and all available KSs is not significant Section concludes A given linguistic item L is associated with a numerical score through a discrimination function (one function for each type of linguistic item that summarizes the relative frequencies of occurrence of L in correct and incorrect hypotheses respectively We start by defining dT as a function on linguistic items The training corpus is analyzed, and each hypothesis is tagged with its set of associated linguistic items The recognizer used a class bigram language model The 1-best sentence error rate was about 34 the 5-best error rate (i The CLE normally assigns a hypothesis several different possible linguistic analyses, scoring each one with a plausibility measure Only the most plausible linguistic analysis was used2% of all hypotheses timed out during linguistic analysis; the average analysis time required per hypothesis was 2 The following knowledge sources were used in the experiments: Recognizer score: The numerical score assigned to each hypothesis by the DECIPHER (TM) recognizer In coverage: Whether or not the CLE assigned the hypothesis a linguistic analysis (1 or 0  Unlikely grammar construction: 1 if the most plausible linguistic analysis assigned to the hypothesis by the CLE was unlikely 0 otherwise Class N-gram discriminants (four distinct knowledge sources Discrimination scores for 1 2 3- and 4-grams of classes of surface linguistic items Grammar rule discriminants: Discrimination scores for the grammar rules used in the most plausible linguistic analysis of the hypothesis, if there was one Semantic triple discriminants: Discrimination scores for semantic triples in the most plausible linguistic analysis of the hypothesis, if there was one Recognizer score + class N-gram discriminant KSs 2
