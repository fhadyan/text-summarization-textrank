 The initial model of the original model merging procedure is the maximum likelihood or trivial model The first experiment compares model merging with a standard bigram model The bigram model yields a Markov model with 1,440 states Model merging starts with the maximum likelihood model for the training part 1,440  Thus, the model found by model merging can be regarded generally better than the bigram model Figure  Therefore, deriving a Markov model by model merging is O(l[4 in time
