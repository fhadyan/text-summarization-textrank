24-25  Hence so is the function  But in this paper we restrict ourselves to the mathematics of compositionality However it does work for smaller classes of functions as the following examples show Proof Hence,  Contradiction And there are many other semantics corresponding to all possible polynomials in and  The moral is that not only it is natural to restrict meaning functions to, say, polynomials, but to further restrict them IDIOMSwall, and high COORDINATION Then: (A  Proof We now prove the second part, i That is, we want semantics to encode some basic intuitions, e (A slightly less general definition, e One of the referees has pointed out two other ideas also and  The answer to this question is somewhat disturbing (Continuing the above mathematical analogy, we would say that the only mode of combination is substitution for an argument  In this paper we have shown the formal vacuity of the compositionality principlee non-arbitrary204-205 in  Furthermore, our results have implications for computational linguistics (they are briefly discussed in  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS , postulates the existence of a homomorphism from syntax to semantics  1 being a function equal to 1 for all values) and in mathematical linguisticst of S THEOREM 1 Thus, although intuitively clear, the definition is not restrictive enough Let be an arbitrary function is partial Given a class of functions F, we say that the compositional semantics is systematic if the meaning function belongs to the class F a function Proof of Corollary 2 Let enumerate S PROPOSITION 4 Proof
