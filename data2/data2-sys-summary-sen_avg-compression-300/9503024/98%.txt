24-25  Hence so is the function  However it does work for smaller classes of functions as the following examples show Proof Hence,  Contradiction The moral is that not only it is natural to restrict meaning functions to, say, polynomials, but to further restrict them IDIOMSwall, and high Then: (A  Proof We now prove the second part, i also and  The answer to this question is somewhat disturbinge non-arbitrary204-205 in  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 1 being a function equal to 1 for all values) and in mathematical linguisticst of S is partial a function Let enumerate S PROPOSITION 4 Proof
