 Compositionality is defined as the property that the meaning of a whole is a function of the meaning of its parts (cf24-25  Hence so is the function  Hence is effectively computable Also, notice that the proposition holds true for generalized computability, in the sense of  He does not define the word systematic except as being an antonym to idiosyncratic  But in this paper we restrict ourselves to the mathematics of compositionality However it does work for smaller classes of functions as the following examples show Proof 10 n+1 1 Hence,  Contradiction And there are many other semantics corresponding to all possible polynomials in and  The moral is that not only it is natural to restrict meaning functions to, say, polynomials, but to further restrict them IDIOMSwall, and high COORDINATION Then: (A  Proof a+b becomes a We now prove the second part, i That is, we want semantics to encode some basic intuitions, e type raising Other constructions can express speech acts, various kind of conflict, etc hence creating rich sets of meanings only by the  by approximating a finite language by an infinite one  (A slightly less general definition, e One of the referees has pointed out two other ideas which can be viewed as a general constraint on compositionality also and  The answer to this question is somewhat disturbing In that model there is no separate syntax, since constructions encode both form and meaning (Continuing the above mathematical analogy, we would say that the only mode of combination is substitution for an argument  In this paper we have shown the formal vacuity of the compositionality principle can be mapped into functional composition operating on functions that encode arbitrary semantics of an arbitrary languagee non-arbitrary204-205 in  Furthermore, our results have implications for computational linguistics (they are briefly discussed in  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Let M be a set of meanings, and let for any , be the meaning of s , postulates the existence of a homomorphism from syntax to semantics  Since elements of Mcan be of any type, we do not automatically have , where is some operation on the meanings 1 being a function equal to 1 for all values) and in mathematical linguisticst of S by assuring , for all s in S (Theorem 1  THEOREM 1 Thus, although intuitively clear, the definition is not restrictive enough Let be an arbitrary function is partial We illustrate the power of the theorem by showing how to assign compositional semantics to idioms and to a very counterintuitive semantics of coordination (Section 4  Similarly for (ii  Given a class of functions F, we say that the compositional semantics is systematic if the meaning function belongs to the class F a function Proof of Corollary 2 Let enumerate S We can create a big table specifying meaning values for all strings and their combinations Clearly, such a process defines the function f, but, intuitively, it is not a definition we would care much for Notice that requiring the computability of the meaning function will not do PROPOSITION 4 Proof
