 Intrasentential antecedents, ie evaluation that involves all the anaphors of the sentence when all the anaphors of the current sentence are processed Intrasentential antecedents are taken into account when applying the focusing algorithm It dealt particularly with pronouns The sentence 5 should require specific treatment, though We first present how intrasentential antecedents occur in embedded sentences Thus an embedded sentence will contain several EEs The focusing algorithm updates the state of the focus after each sentence anaphor (except the first sentence  The structure we studied is the embedded sentence structure The focusing approach always prefers the previous sentences' entities as antecedents to the current sentences In fact only previous sentence entities are present in the focus registers Thus phrases of the current sentence can not be proposed as antecedents The focusing mechanism fails in the expected focus algorithm when encountering anaphors occurring in the first sentence of a text, which we call initial anaphors, such as They in sentence (1  The basic focusing cycle is applied on each EE in turn and not sentence by sentence Second hypothesis : The initial EE of a well formed first sentence does not contain non-PRR pronouns just as an initial simple sentence cannot
