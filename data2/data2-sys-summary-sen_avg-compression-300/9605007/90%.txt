 Intrasentential antecedents, ie updating the focus registers the evaluation of the proposed antecedents for each anaphor The algorithm is based on the decomposition of the sentence into EEs and the application of the basic focusing cycle on each EE in turn and not sentence by sentencee its semantic representation, into EEs Step 3 Perform the basic focusing cycle for every anaphor of all the EEs of the current sentencee evaluation that involves all the anaphors of the sentence when all the anaphors of the current sentence are processed Step 5 Process the next sentence until all the sentences are processed: split the sentence into EEs apply Step 3 then Step 4 Intrasentential antecedents are taken into account when applying the focusing algorithm For example, to process pronouns of the sentence 6 split into two EES (see below the algorithm must consider EE2 before EE1 The sentence 5 should require specific treatment, though We first present how intrasentential antecedents occur in embedded sentences An embedded sentence contains either more than one verb or a verb and derivations of other verbs (see sentence 1 with verbs said and forming  Thus an embedded sentence will contain several EEs The remaining 18 non-PRR pronouns have intersentential antecedents Pronouns \t\t 332non-PRR \t\t 262With intrasentential antecedents \t\t 244in an embedded sentence \t\t With intrasentential in a simple \t\t 0sentence \t\t With intersentential antecedents \t\t 18 Our assumption means that, while the PRR pronouns may find their antecedents in an non embedded sentence (e The focusing algorithm updates the state of the focus after each sentence anaphor (except the first sentence  The structure we studied is the embedded sentence structure The focusing approach always prefers the previous sentences' entities as antecedents to the current sentences In fact only previous sentence entities are present in the focus registers Thus phrases of the current sentence can not be proposed as antecedents The focusing mechanism fails in the expected focus algorithm when encountering anaphors occurring in the first sentence of a text, which we call initial anaphors, such as They in sentence (1  Moreover, our assumption states that when non-PRR anaphors have intrasentential antecedents, they occur in embedded sentences The basic focusing cycle is applied on each EE in turn and not sentence by sentence Second hypothesis : The initial EE of a well formed first sentence does not contain non-PRR pronouns just as an initial simple sentence cannot
