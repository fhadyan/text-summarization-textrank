 Intrasentential antecedents, ie antecedents occurring in the same sentence as the anaphor, are a crucial issue for the anaphora resolution method The algorithm is designed for anaphors generally, even if we focus mainly on pronouns in this paper In the following, remember that what we called the basic focusing cycle is the following successive steps: applying the resolution rules, applying the focusing algorithm, ie updating the focus registers the evaluation of the proposed antecedents for each anaphor The algorithm is based on the decomposition of the sentence into EEs and the application of the basic focusing cycle on each EE in turn and not sentence by sentence The complete steps are given below (see also figure 1 Step 1 Split the sentence, ie its semantic representation, into EEs Step 2 Apply the expected focus algorithm to the first EE Step 3 Perform the basic focusing cycle for every anaphor of all the EEs of the current sentencee evaluation that involves all the anaphors of the sentence when all the anaphors of the current sentence are processed Step 5 Process the next sentence until all the sentences are processed: split the sentence into EEs apply Step 3 then Step 4 Intrasentential antecedents are taken into account when applying the focusing algorithm For example, in sentence 1, the intrasentential antecedent Bill will be taken into account, because EE1 would be processed beforehand by the expected focusing algorithm The expected focusing algorithm is applied only on the initial EE which must not contain anaphors It dealt particularly with pronounsg see , and  For example, to process pronouns of the sentence 6 split into two EES (see below the algorithm must consider EE2 before EE1 The sentence 5 should require specific treatment, though We first present how intrasentential antecedents occur in embedded sentences An embedded sentence contains either more than one verb or a verb and derivations of other verbs (see sentence 1 with verbs said and forming  The set of conceptual structures of the current sentence Si where the anaphor occurs; The set of conceptual structures of the current elementary event EEi where the anaphor occurs after the Si splitting We have proposed a methodology to resolve anaphors occurring in embedded sentences We demonstrated that anaphors with intrasentential antecedents are closely related to embedded sentences and we showed how to exploit this data to design the anaphora resolution methodology Mainly, we exploited Sidner's focusing mechanism, refining the classical unit of processing, that is the sentence, to that of the elementary event Broadly speaking embedded sentences concern more than one fact Thus an embedded sentence will contain several EEs Factors that influence embedded sentences are mainly semantic features of verbs On the basis of 120 articles, of 4 sentences on average, containing 332 pronouns altogether, we made the following assumption (1 Assumption : non-PRR pronouns can have intrasentential antecedents, only if these pronouns occur in an embedded sentence The statistics below show that of 262 non-PRR pronouns, there are 244 having intrasentential antecedents, all of which occur in embedded sentences and none in a simple sentence The remaining 18 non-PRR pronouns have intersentential antecedents Pronouns \t\t 332non-PRR \t\t 262With intrasentential antecedents \t\t 244in an embedded sentence \t\t With intrasentential in a simple \t\t 0sentence \t\t With intersentential antecedents \t\t 18 Our assumption means that, while the PRR pronouns may find their antecedents in an non embedded sentence (eg sentences 2 and 3) the non-PRR pronouns can note considering semantic parameters such as the type of verbs that introduce embedded sentences Sidner proposed a methodology, modelling the way focus of attention and anaphor resolution influence one another Using pronouns reflects what the speaker has focused on in the previous sentence, so that the focus is that phrase which the pronouns refer to The resolution is organised through the following processes: The expected focus algorithm that selects an initial focus called the expected focus  We propose to consider new kinds of criteria that combine semantic restrictions with sentence structure Each IR in the algorithm appropriate to an anaphor suggests one or several antecedents depending on the focus and on the anaphor type An evaluation of the proposed antecedents is performed using different kinds of criteria (syntactic, semantic, inferential, etc The focusing algorithm makes use of data structures, ie the focus registers that represent the state of the focus: the current focus (CF) representation, alternate focus list (AFL) that contains the other phrases of the sentence and the focus stack (FS  The focusing algorithm updates the state of the focus after each sentence anaphor (except the first sentence  One of these criteria is, for example, the way in which the verb meaning influences the sentence structure, then the way in which the sentence structure influences the anaphoric relations between intrasentential phrases After the first sentence, it confirms or rejects the predicted focus taking into account the results of anaphor interpretation The structure we studied is the embedded sentence structure We call a basic focusing cycle the cycle that includes : the focusing algorithm followed by the interpretation of anaphors, then by the evaluation of the proposed antecedents The focusing approach always prefers the previous sentences' entities as antecedents to the current sentences In fact only previous sentence entities are present in the focus registers Thus phrases of the current sentence can not be proposed as antecedents This problem has already been underlined, see in particular who proposed augmenting the focus registers with the entities of the current sentence For example in sentence 4 while the focus algorithm would propose only John as an antecedent for him in Carter's method Bill will also be proposed The focusing mechanism fails in the expected focus algorithm when encountering anaphors occurring in the first sentence of a text, which we call initial anaphors, such as They in sentence (1  The problem with initial anaphors is that the focus registers cannot be initialised or may be wrongly filled if there are anaphors inside the first sentence of the text Indeed, an important assumption we have made is that embedded sentences favour the occurrence of intrasentential antecedents It is clear that taking the sentence in its classical meaning as the unit of processing in the focusing approach, is not suitable when sentences are embedded As stated above, embedded sentences include several elementary events (EEs  Moreover, our assumption states that when non-PRR anaphors have intrasentential antecedents, they occur in embedded sentences An EE is the unit of processing in our resolution algorithm instead of the sentence The basic focusing cycle is applied on each EE in turn and not sentence by sentence Notice that a simple sentence coincides with its EE Second hypothesis : The initial EE of a well formed first sentence does not contain non-PRR pronouns just as an initial simple sentence cannot For example, in the splitting of sentence 1 into two EEs (see below EE1 does not contain non-PRR pronouns because it is the initial EE of the whole discourse PRR could refer to intrasentential antecedents in simple sentences (such as in those of sentences 3 and 4
