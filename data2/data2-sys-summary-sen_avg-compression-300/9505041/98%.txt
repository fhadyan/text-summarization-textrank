 Every set of trees that is accepted in this way is the projection of a local set Language complexity provides one of the most useful measures with which to compare languages and language formalisms Much of the value of standard language complexity classes, on the other hand, comes from results that allow one to show that a given language or class of languages is not included in a particular complexity class We thus establish that this account licenses a strongly context-free language The principles we capture include basic X-bar Theory, Theta Theory, the Case Filter, Binding Theory, Control Theory and various constraints on movement, in particular the Empty Category Principle Our approach to chains will work for any account of language that satisfies this principle With such extended characterizations one might establish upper bounds on the complexity of human language in general The fact that the formalization is possible, then, establishes a relatively strong language complexity result for the theory we capture
