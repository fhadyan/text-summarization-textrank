 Spoken language processing challenges for integration of speech recognition into natural language processing, and must deal with multi-level knowledge sources from signal level to symbol level The phoneme recognition module targets 1000 morpheme continuous speech, currently speaker dependent due to the short of standard speech database for Korean This section demonstrates the SKOPE's performance in continuous diphone recognition, morphological analysis, and syntax analysis experiments Currently, we are pursuing multi-strategic approaches to the advanced spoken language processing model, including optimizing TDNN-based phoneme recognition module, integrating HMM-based morpheme recognition module into the connectionist phoneme recognition, and incorporating probabilistic searches into the morphological analysis process as well as the syntactic analysis process 2) The linguistic characteristics of Korean are fully considered in phoneme recognition, speech and language integration, and morphological/syntactic processing The architecture consists of three different but closely interrelated modules: phoneme recognition, morphological analysis, and syntactic analysis module The morphological analysis begins the primitive language processing, and connects the speech recognition to the language processing at the phoneme-level The morphological analysis starts with the phoneme lattice Often these systems employ a pronunciation dictionary for speech recognition and independent dictionaries for natural language processing
