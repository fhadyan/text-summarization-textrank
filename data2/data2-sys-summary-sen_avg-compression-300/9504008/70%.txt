 Spoken language processing challenges for integration of speech recognition into natural language processing, and must deal with multi-level knowledge sources from signal level to symbol level The multi-level knowledge integration and handling increase the technical difficulty of both the speech and the natural language processing Unfortunately even the Japanese researchers apply degenerated morphological techniques for the spoken Japanese processing [  The phoneme recognition module targets 1000 morpheme continuous speech, currently speaker dependent due to the short of standard speech database for Korean This section demonstrates the SKOPE's performance in continuous diphone recognition, morphological analysis, and syntax analysis experiments Figure -a shows the continuous diphone recognition performance For the agglutinative languages, we need sub-word level integration which leaves rooms for general morphological processing To compare the ability of handling the continuous speech, we also tested the diphone recognition using the hand-segmented test patterns with the same 7772 target diphones Figure -b shows the segmented diphone recognition performance4 demonstrates the diphone's suitability to handling the continuous speech For the morphological analysis performance, we used the same 990 Eojeol patterns to train the phoneme recognition module, and the 2600 Eojeol patterns to test the morphological analysis performance directly from the speech input Figure shows the results This experiment shows that most of the morphological errors are propagated from the incorrect (deleted) or spurious (inserted) phoneme recognition results To see the original performance of the morphological and syntactic analysis modules assuming no speech recognition error, we artificially made the phoneme lattices by mutating the correctly recognized phoneme sequences according to the phoneme recognizer's confusion matrix Each phoneme lattice was made to contain at least one correct recognition result, so the phoneme recognition performance is assumed to be perfect except the artificially made insertion errors (mutations  The average phoneme alternatives per single correct phoneme in the lattice are 23[31] phoneme chains in each lattice Figure shows the morphological and syntactic analysis results for these artificially made phoneme lattices Recent development of connectionist speech recognition [ ] and connectionist natural language processing [ ] shed lights on the connectionist/symbolic hybrid models of spoken language processing, and some of the researches are already available for English and other Indo-European languages [  The morphological analysis was perfect as shown in the table Since the phoneme lattice was made to contain at least one correct phoneme recognition result, the morphological analysis must be perfect as long as the morpheme is enrolled in the dictionary and the connectivity information can cover all the morpheme combinations This results verify that most of the morphological analysis errors from real speech input are actually propagated from the phoneme recognition errors as discussed before This paper explains the design and implementation of spoken Korean processing engine, which is a connectionist/symbolic hybrid model of spoken language processing by utilizing the linguistic characteristics of Korean The SKOPE model demonstrates the synergetic integration of connectionist and symbolic techniques by considering the relative strength and weakness of two different techniques, and also demonstrates the phoneme level speech and language integration for general morphological processing for agglutinative languages However, current implementation of the system still suffers from excessive continuous speech recognition errors Since the large vocabulary continuous speech recognition is still an open problem, we cannot hope for the 100% correct speech recognition results in the near future Currently, we are pursuing multi-strategic approaches to the advanced spoken language processing model, including optimizing TDNN-based phoneme recognition module, integrating HMM-based morpheme recognition module into the connectionist phoneme recognition, and incorporating probabilistic searches into the morphological analysis process as well as the syntactic analysis process The SKOPE's various modules were programmed by our students: the phoneme recognition module by Kyunghee Kim Kyubong Baac, the morphological analysis module by EunChul Lee Wonil Lee, and finally the syntax analysis module by Wonil Lee 2) The linguistic characteristics of Korean are fully considered in phoneme recognition, speech and language integration, and morphological/syntactic processing In the speech recognition side, the recognition must be at phoneme-level for large vocabulary continuous speech, and the speech recognition module must provide right level of outputs to the natural language module in the form of not single solution but many alternatives of solution hypotheses 1) A Korean word, called Eojeol, consists of more than one morphemes with clear-cut morpheme boundaries The spoken morphological analysis must deal with an Eonjeol since no Eojeol boundary can be provided in the speech The architecture consists of three different but closely interrelated modules: phoneme recognition, morphological analysis, and syntactic analysis module The phoneme recognition module processes the signal-level information, and changes it to the symbol-level information (phoneme lattice  The speech recognition module can also ask the linguistic scores from the language processing module in a more tightly coupled bottom-up/top-down hybrid integration scheme [  The morphological analysis begins the primitive language processing, and connects the speech recognition to the language processing at the phoneme-level The syntactic analysis module finishes the language processing, and produces the domain independent syntactic structures for application systems Considering the signal characteristics of the Korean phonemes, we define diphones as a new sub-word recognition unit Figure shows the architecture of the component TDNNs in the phoneme recognition module The whole module consists of total 19 different TDNNs for recognition of the defined Korean diphones In the natural language side, the insertion, deletion, and substitution errors of continuous speech must be compensated by robust parsing and partial parsing techniques, e The morphological analysis starts with the phoneme lattice The phoneme lattice delivers the alternative phonetic transcriptions of input speech, which must be searched by the morphological/phonological analyzer to reconstruct the orthographic morpheme strings The central part of the morphological analysis lies in the dictionary construction Figure shows the unified dictionary both for speech and language processing (called morpheme-level phonetic dictionary) with three different morpheme entries ci-wu, l, swu Figure shows our extended table-driven morphological analysis process The example phoneme lattice was obtained from the input speech ci-wul-sswu (removable and the morphological analysis produces ci-wu+l+swu (remove+ADNOMINAL+BOUND-NOUN where is the morpheme boundary, and is the syllable boundary The extended morpheme segmentation is basically performed using the dictionary search Most of the speech and natural language systems which were developed for English and other Indo-European languages neglect the morphological processing, and integrate speech and natural language at the word level [  Often these systems employ a pronunciation dictionary for speech recognition and independent dictionaries for natural language processing The orthographic rule modeling must be integrated with the phonological rule modeling in spoken language processing The phoneme lattice-based morphological analysis produces the morphologically analyzed (segmented and stem reconstructed) morpheme sequences Since there are usually more than one analysis results due to the errors of speech recognition process, the outputs are usually organized as morpheme lattice However, for the agglutinative languages such as Korean and Japanese, the morphological processing plays a major role in the language processing since these languages have very complex morphological phenomena and relatively simple syntactic functionality For the seamless integration of the morphological analysis with the syntax analysis, we employ the same table-driven control for the syntax analysis as well as the morphological analysis Figure shows table-driven interactive relaxation parsing
