 Spoken language processing challenges for integration of speech recognition into natural language processing, and must deal with multi-level knowledge sources from signal level to symbol level The phoneme recognition module targets 1000 morpheme continuous speech, currently speaker dependent due to the short of standard speech database for Korean This section demonstrates the SKOPE's performance in continuous diphone recognition, morphological analysis, and syntax analysis experiments Figure -a shows the continuous diphone recognition performance Figure -b shows the segmented diphone recognition performance For the morphological analysis performance, we used the same 990 Eojeol patterns to train the phoneme recognition module, and the 2600 Eojeol patterns to test the morphological analysis performance directly from the speech input3[31] phoneme chains in each lattice Figure shows the morphological and syntactic analysis results for these artificially made phoneme lattices Since the phoneme lattice was made to contain at least one correct phoneme recognition result, the morphological analysis must be perfect as long as the morpheme is enrolled in the dictionary and the connectivity information can cover all the morpheme combinations This results verify that most of the morphological analysis errors from real speech input are actually propagated from the phoneme recognition errors as discussed before Currently, we are pursuing multi-strategic approaches to the advanced spoken language processing model, including optimizing TDNN-based phoneme recognition module, integrating HMM-based morpheme recognition module into the connectionist phoneme recognition, and incorporating probabilistic searches into the morphological analysis process as well as the syntactic analysis process 2) The linguistic characteristics of Korean are fully considered in phoneme recognition, speech and language integration, and morphological/syntactic processing The architecture consists of three different but closely interrelated modules: phoneme recognition, morphological analysis, and syntactic analysis module The phoneme recognition module processes the signal-level information, and changes it to the symbol-level information (phoneme lattice  The morphological analysis begins the primitive language processing, and connects the speech recognition to the language processing at the phoneme-level The morphological analysis starts with the phoneme lattice Figure shows the unified dictionary both for speech and language processing (called morpheme-level phonetic dictionary) with three different morpheme entries ci-wu, l, swu Figure shows our extended table-driven morphological analysis process Often these systems employ a pronunciation dictionary for speech recognition and independent dictionaries for natural language processing The phoneme lattice-based morphological analysis produces the morphologically analyzed (segmented and stem reconstructed) morpheme sequences
