 Moreover, n1 must be associated with an f-structure node w' which can also be reached by making a transition from the f-structure node w associated with the mother node of m Although the LFG equations discussed so far were defining equations, LFG also allows so-called constraining equations (written =c  Briefly, the up- and down-arrows in the schemata can be read as follows: denotes the value of Feature in the f-structure associated with the tree node immediately dominating the current tree node, whereas denotes the value of Feature in the f-structure associated with the current tree node For instance, in rule (1) the NP schema indicates that the f-structure associated with the NP node is the value of the subj feature in the f-structure associated with the mother node As for the VP schema, it requires that the f-structure associated with the mother node is identical with the f-structure associated with the VP node The ontology underlying LFG is a composite one, consisting of trees, feature structures and links between the two Firstly we define  This is a standard way of viewing feature structures, and is appropriate for LFG This completes our mathematical picture of LFG ontology Firstly, LFG grammars impose constraints on  Secondly, LFG grammars impose general constraints on various features in  Thirdly, LFG grammars impose constraints on zoomin
