 We specify this as follows Consider first the uniqueness principle Briefly, the up- and down-arrows in the schemata can be read as follows: denotes the value of Feature in the f-structure associated with the tree node immediately dominating the current tree node, whereas denotes the value of Feature in the f-structure associated with the current tree node This completes our mathematical picture of LFG ontology Firstly, LFG grammars impose constraints on  Secondly, LFG grammars impose general constraints on various features in  Thirdly, LFG grammars impose constraints on zoomin
