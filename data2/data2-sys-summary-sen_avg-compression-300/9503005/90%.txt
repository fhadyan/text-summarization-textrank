 Unlike most linguistic theories, LFG (see Kaplan and Bresnan (1982 treats grammatical relations as first class citizens Now for some examples Moreover, n1 must be associated with an f-structure node w' which can also be reached by making a transition from the f-structure node w associated with the mother node of m (In other words, that part of the f-structure that is associated with the NP node is re-entrant with the value of the subj feature in the f-structure associated with the S node And finally, n2 must be associated with that f-structure node w which m Although the LFG equations discussed so far were defining equations, LFG also allows so-called constraining equations (written =c  That is, they add a feature value pair to any consistent f-structure The role of these components is to assign two interrelated structures to any linguistic entity licensed by the grammar: a tree (the c-structure) and a feature structure (the f-structure  Briefly, the up- and down-arrows in the schemata can be read as follows: denotes the value of Feature in the f-structure associated with the tree node immediately dominating the current tree node, whereas denotes the value of Feature in the f-structure associated with the current tree node For instance, in rule (1) the NP schema indicates that the f-structure associated with the NP node is the value of the subj feature in the f-structure associated with the mother node As for the VP schema, it requires that the f-structure associated with the mother node is identical with the f-structure associated with the VP node Moreover, the resulting f-structure respects the LFG well formedness conditions, namely the uniqueness, completeness and coherence principles discussed in section 5 The ontology underlying LFG is a composite one, consisting of trees, feature structures and links between the two In the following section, we shall present a formal language for talking about this representation; that is, a language for specifying LFG grammars This is a standard way of viewing feature structures, and is appropriate for LFG We define a specification language in which (most of) the interactions between c- and f-structure typical of LFG grammars can be stated directly This completes our mathematical picture of LFG ontology The key idea underlying our approach is to think about LFG model theoretically Firstly, LFG grammars impose constraints on  Secondly, LFG grammars impose general constraints on various features in  Thirdly, LFG grammars impose constraints on zoomin As has already been noted, the basic entities underlying the LFG analyses are composite structures consisting of a finite tree, a finite feature structure, and a function that links the two
