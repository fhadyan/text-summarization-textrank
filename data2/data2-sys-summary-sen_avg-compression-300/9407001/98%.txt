 For generation, X2MORF expected a feature structure as input reproducing one or more word forms encode finite state automata directly in the feature formalism below  Well-typedness requirements restrict the space of valid feature structures (cf PS1 allow general implicative and negative constraints in the form of conditional feature structures Besides constraints enforcing simple structure sharing (eg the Head Feature Principle given in Fig
