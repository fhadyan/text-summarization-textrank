agents can choose whether to accept a new belief or revise old beliefs ,  The occurrence of IRU's in dialogue has many ramifications for a model of dialogue Accounting for IRU's has two direct effects on a dialogue model This paper will focus on (1) leaving (2) for future work One function of IRU's is to address the assumptions on which mutual beliefs are based Linguistic actions are different than physical actions An agent's prior beliefs, preferences and goals cannot be ascertained by direct inspection This means that it is difficult for the speaker to verify when an action has achieved its expected result, and so giving and receiving evidence is critical and the process of establishing mutual beliefs is carefully monitored by the conversants (4) The context of a discourse is an undifferentiated set of propositions with no specific relations between them Section discusses assumption (1 section shows how assumption (2) can be dropped; section discusses (3 section shows that some IRU's facilitate the inference of relations between adjacent propositions indicates to everyone in P that everyone in P has reason to believe that holds indicates to everyone in P that  The situation , used above in the mutual belief induction schema, is the context of what has been said Mutual beliefs can be inferred based on some evidence, but these beliefs may depend on underlying assumptions that are easily defeasible This model can be implemented using Gallier's theory of autonomous belief revision and the corresponding system  This ordering reflects the relative defeasibility of different assumptions Augmenting the strength of an assumption thus decreases its relative defeasibility Thus mutual beliefs depend on a defeasible inference process All inferences depend on the evidence to support them, and stronger evidence can defeat weaker evidence So a mutual belief supported as an inference can get defeated by linguistic information This section examines the assumption from the DETERMINISTIC MODEL that: (2) Propositions representing beliefs and intentions get added to the context by the unilateral action of one conversant This assumption will also be examined in section  I adopt the assumption that the participants in a dialogue are trying to achieve some purpose  Some aspects of the structure of dialogue arises from the structure of these purposes and their relation to one another Inference of mutual understanding relies upon some evidence, e the utterance that is made, and a number of underlying assumptions The assumptions are given with the inference rule below All of the assumptions start out supported by no evidence; their evidence type is therefore hypothesis It isn't until after the addressee's next action that an assumption can have its strength modified Then B's understanding of u should include B making this inference All that prompts such as uh huh do is provide evidence of attention However repetitions, paraphrases and making inferences explicit also demonstrate complete hearing a PARAPHRASE is stronger evidence of understanding than a REPEAT  Consider example 1 in section  This upgrades the evidence for the assumptions of hearing and attention associated with utterance (7) from hypothesis to linguistic
