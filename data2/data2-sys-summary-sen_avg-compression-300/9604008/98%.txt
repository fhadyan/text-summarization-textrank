 Thus, every STSG tree would be produced by the PCFG with equal probability We call the best parse tree under this criterion the Maximum Constituents Parse There are two existing ways to parse using the DOP model One could try to find the most probable parse tree For a given sentence and a given parse tree, there are many different derivations that could lead to that parse tree This parse tree is most probable Bod shows how to approximate this most probable parse using a Monte Carlo algorithm Thus every STSG tree would be produced by the PCFG with equal probability
