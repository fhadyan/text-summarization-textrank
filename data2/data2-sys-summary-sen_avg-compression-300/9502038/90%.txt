 The version of the Xerox tagger used for the implementation described here is the DDS Tagger version 1 Again, errors mainly affect the assignment of words to subclasses within one major word class Table shows the most common errors produced by the German model a definition of the tag set to be used by the HMM, 2 a set of initial transition biases, 5 a set of initial symbol biases, 6 a sufficiently large text for training the HMM, 7 a reference text with correctly assigned POS tags, 8 The tags used in the ELWIS tag set are given in table  (2) For each word form the lexicon gives the set of POS tags that can be assigned to that word (4) The model is trained using a set of initial transition biases, including both positive and negative constraints on tag sequences Although the model can be trained without initial biases, the performance of the resulting model increases significantly if appropriate initial biases are used (5) Initial symbol biases are an additional set of biases used to define preferences for tag assignment given a particular equivalence class The best results of this implementation were obtained running 20 iterations of training over the 200,000 word training text, using a total of 50 transition and 17 symbol biases The test text used to evaluate the German model described in section has an ambiguity rate of 151 tags for each word in the text French language model for the Xerox tagger The tag set used to annotate the English text is a slightly modified version of the Brown tag set, consisting of a total of 72 tags For the French text the tag set described in with 37 different tags is used noun vs
