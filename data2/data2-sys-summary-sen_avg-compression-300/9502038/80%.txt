 The version of the Xerox tagger used for the implementation described here is the DDS Tagger version 1 In German most of the effort is going into subclassification within major word classes, while in English and French a good deal of disambiguation work is devoted to separate major word classes Again, errors mainly affect the assignment of words to subclasses within one major word class Table shows the most common errors produced by the German model The first column gives the relative frequenciy and the second column lists the tag chosen by the German HMM tagger finite present tense forms While this technique helps to confine word senses for English and French, it is of little help for word sense disambiguation in German The tagger was used to annotate all of the 50 million word German corpora contained on the ECI Multilingual Corpus 1 CD-ROM a definition of the tag set to be used by the HMM, 2 a lexicon listing word forms with their equivalence classes, that is the list of POS tags that can be assigned to the word form, 3 a set of initial transition biases, 5 a set of initial symbol biases, 6 a sufficiently large text for training the HMM, 7 a reference text with correctly assigned POS tags, 8 (1) The tag set used in the implementation is the smaller version of the two tag sets developed jointly by the Universities of Stuttgart and Tbingen, referred to as the ELWIS tag set (cf The tags used in the ELWIS tag set are given in table  (2) For each word form the lexicon gives the set of POS tags that can be assigned to that word Since then the original tag set was redefined, making the tagged corpus used to train the LIKELY tagger obsolete (3) Class guessers for the Xerox tagger assign potential POS tags to unknown words according to a surface analysis of the word form (4) The model is trained using a set of initial transition biases, including both positive and negative constraints on tag sequences Although the model can be trained without initial biases, the performance of the resulting model increases significantly if appropriate initial biases are used (5) Initial symbol biases are an additional set of biases used to define preferences for tag assignment given a particular equivalence class The best results of this implementation were obtained running 20 iterations of training over the 200,000 word training text, using a total of 50 transition and 17 symbol biases With this configuration of training parameters, the resulting HMM assigned incorrect tags when run on the reference texts and compared with the manually assigned tags However, the performance of the resulting HMM is very poor if no initial biases are used to help the training process find suitable parameters For comparison, the evaluation procedure used to evaluate the implementation of the HMM tagger described in the preceding section was repeated without using any of the initial biases The test text used to evaluate the German model described in section has an ambiguity rate of 151 tags for each word in the text French language model for the Xerox tagger The tag set used to annotate the English text is a slightly modified version of the Brown tag set, consisting of a total of 72 tags For the French text the tag set described in with 37 different tags is used In terms of ambiguity rates, the English, French, and German texts are thus quite comparable
