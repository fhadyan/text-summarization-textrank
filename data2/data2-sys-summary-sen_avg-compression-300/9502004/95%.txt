 Earley deduction is based on grammars encoded as definite clauses For unit clauses, the priority is identified with the preference value The following is the algorithm for bottom-up best-first Earley deduction The set of selected clauses is called the chart In bottom-up Earley deduction, the first step towards proving a goal is perform lookup for the goal, and to add all the resulting (unit) clauses to the chart For these grammars data-driven bottom-up processing is more appropriate Whenever a unit clause is combined with a non-unit clause all goals up to the first waiting goal of the resulting clause are proved according to their goal type, and then a new clause is added whose selected goal is the first waiting goal In the following inference rule for clauses with mixed goal types, is a (possibly empty) sequence of goals without any waiting goals, and is a (possibly empty) sequence of goals starting with a waiting goal
