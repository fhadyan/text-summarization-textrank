 This gives us a means of efficiently storing the potentially unbounded feature structures associated with nodes in a derivation tree (derived feature structures  z) subtrees (these subtrees must be the full binary tree  While the tree sets of LIG and Tree Adjoining Grammars have independent branches, pltg tree sets exhibit dependent branches, where the number of dependent branches in any tree is bounded by the grammar
