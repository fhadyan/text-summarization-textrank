 This gives us a means of efficiently storing the potentially unbounded feature structures associated with nodes in a derivation tree (derived feature structures  This entry would be underspecified, for example, the value of feature would be specified to be any feature stored in the array entry for the substring whose feature fhad the value a The plpatr recognition algorithm employs a second array (called the compatibility array which encodes information about the compatibility of derived feature structures Tuples of compatible derived feature structures are stored in the compatibility array using exactly the same approach used to store feature structures in the main recognition array In naive implementations of unification grammar parsers, feature structures play the same role as nonterminals in standard context-free grammar parsers Productions now specify how the tree associated with the mother is related to the trees associated with the daughters z) subtrees (these subtrees must be the full binary tree  As a further illustration of the constraints places on shared subtrees, Figure shows a local tree that could appear in a derivation tree Having made the move from trees to feature structures, we consider the possibility of re-entrancy in plpatr Note that the feature structure at the root of a plpatr derivation tree will not involve re-entrancy In unification-based grammar, the feature structure associated with the root of the tree is often regarded as the structure that has been derived from the input (i Because feature structures associated with all nodes in the tree are available, feature information need only be passed up the tree when it is required in order to establish dependencies within the derivation tree As is the case for the tree sets of ig, LIG and Tree Adjoining Grammar, the tree sets generated by pltg have path sets that are context-free languages While the tree sets of LIG and Tree Adjoining Grammars have independent branches, pltg tree sets exhibit dependent branches, where the number of dependent branches in any tree is bounded by the grammarg they generate sets of all full binary trees
