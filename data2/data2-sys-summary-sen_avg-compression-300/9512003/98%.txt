 In the cache model, popping only occurs via displacement Thus, return pops are not problematic for the cache model 88,89 The occurrence of IRUs as in dialogue C is one way of doing this This squib has discussed the role of limited attention in a computational model of discourse processing The notion of processing effort for retrieval operations on main memory makes predictions that can be experimentally tested The CACHE represents working memory and MAIN MEMORY represents long-term memory The cache model includes specific assumptions about processing
