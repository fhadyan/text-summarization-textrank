 In the cache model, popping only occurs via displacement As a potential alternative to the stack model, the cache model appears to be unable to handle return pops since a previous state of the cache can't be popped to Thus, return pops are not problematic for the cache model 88,89 The occurrence of IRUs as in dialogue C is one way of doing this This squib has discussed the role of limited attention in a computational model of discourse processing The cache model was proposed as a computational implemention of human working memory and operations on attentional state are formulated as operations on a cache The notion of processing effort for retrieval operations on main memory makes predictions that can be experimentally tested Here, I propose an alternate model to the stack model, which I will call the CACHE MODEL, and discuss the evidence for this model The CACHE represents working memory and MAIN MEMORY represents long-term memory The cache is a limited capacity, almost instantaneously accessible, memory store There are three operations involving the cache and main memory Items in the cache can be preferentially RETAINED and items in main memory can be RETRIEVED to the cache Items in the cache can also be STORED to main memory The cache model includes specific assumptions about processing
