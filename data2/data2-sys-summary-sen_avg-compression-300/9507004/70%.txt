 The model presented is based on two basic principles: Empirical rigour: all and only correct forms are analysed and generated, whether regular or not; gaps in verb paradigms are observed; suppletive forms are considered valid, and so on The current dictionary has a considerable size: 43,000 lemma entries, including 24,400 nouns, 7,600 verbs, and 11,000 adjectives On the other hand, our goal is to generate and recognize all (and only) well-formed inflected forms, and thus we do not accept missing forms for defective verbs (see below but do accept duplicate but correct forms As an inflectional language, Spanish shows a great variety of morphological processes, particularly non-concatenative ones For simple tenses, we consider 53 inflected forms (see Table excluding the archaic Future Subjunctive, but including the duplicate Imperfect Past Subjunctive (6 forms  If we add the 45 possible forms for compound tenses, then 98 inflected forms are possible for each verb This example shows internal vowel modification triggered by different morphemes having the same external form: hag-o; hiz-o, hech-o (The first o/ is first person singular present indicative morpheme; the second o/ is third singular preterit indicative morpheme; and the third o/ is past participle morpheme - an irregular one, by the way  only one stem for all the forms as in am-ar am-o, etc In the so-called defective verbs some forms are missing or simply not used are conjugated only in third person singular Other ones are more peculiar, like abolir (to abolish) that lacks first, second and third singular and third plural present indicative forms, all present subjunctive forms, and the second singular imperative form Duplicate past participles: a number of verbs have two alternative forms, both correct, like impreso, imprimido (printed  concatenating the gender morpheme to the stem) and with inherent gender (i without gender morphemes  Some nouns and adjectives present alternative correct forms for plural -e for bamb (bamboo bamb-s and, bamb-es crisis We support the idea that unification and feature-based morphology is more adequate for languages, such as Spanish and other Latin languages, that have alternative stems triggered by specific suffixes, missing forms in the paradigm, and duplicate correct forms It is well known that morphological processes are divided into two types: processes related to the phonological and/or graphic form (morpho-graphemics and processes related to the combination of morphemes (morpho-syntax  Two-level morphology uses phonological rules and continuation classes (in the lexical component  We present some examples of dictionary entries: two verbal ending entries (allomorphs) for the past participle morphemes and two allomorph stems for imprimir, compatible with those endings The full inventory of such categories follows: w For complete inflected word forms wl For words (nouns and adjectives) that can accept a number morpheme nl For nominal -nouns and adjectives- lexemes Two-level morphology uses instead rules that match lexical representations (lemmas) with surface representations (actual spelling forms  vm For verb morphemes ng For nominal gender morphemes nn For nominal number morphemes For example, sing_1 means first person, singular number; while pres_ind means present tense, indicative mood The following examples show those contextual features both in nominal morphemes and in nominal lexeme entries: These entries allow the analysis/generation of the word forms presidente, presidenta, presidentes and presidentas for the lemma presidente; doctor, doctora, doctores and doctoras for doctor; and bamb, bambs and bambes for bamb In particular, inflected verb forms are analysed or generated by two rules Actually, only one rule is needed, but as we used the value 100 for the stt feature for regular verbs instead of a disjunction of all the possible stt values, we split the rule in two: Nominal inflection is a bit more complicated, because of the combination of two inflectional morphemes (gender and number) in some cases The first one is for singular words, when the stem has to be concatenated to a gender suffix (ni-o, ni-a the second is for plural words, where an additional number suffix is added (nio-s) ; the third builds plurals from an allomorph stem and a plural morpheme (len / leon-es and the fourth rule validates as words the singular forms (wl) obtained from the first rule without further concatenation: The predicate member included in the procedural part of the DCG rule implements disjunction in atomic contextual features, although it could have been eliminated with a different encoding of the lexical entries The grammar rules are stated using the DCG formalism included in most Prolog implementations, thus we have used the DCG interpreter both for parsing and generating word forms
