 The model presented is based on two basic principles: Empirical rigour: all and only correct forms are analysed and generated, whether regular or not; gaps in verb paradigms are observed; suppletive forms are considered valid, and so on On the other hand, our goal is to generate and recognize all (and only) well-formed inflected forms, and thus we do not accept missing forms for defective verbs (see below but do accept duplicate but correct forms A highly complex verb paradigm For simple tenses, we consider 53 inflected forms (see Table excluding the archaic Future Subjunctive, but including the duplicate Imperfect Past Subjunctive (6 forms  If we add the 45 possible forms for compound tenses, then 98 inflected forms are possible for each verb This example shows internal vowel modification triggered by different morphemes having the same external form: hag-o; hiz-o, hech-o (The first o/ is first person singular present indicative morpheme; the second o/ is third singular preterit indicative morpheme; and the third o/ is past participle morpheme - an irregular one, by the way  only one stem for all the forms as in am-ar am-o, etc In the so-called defective verbs some forms are missing or simply not used Other ones are more peculiar, like abolir (to abolish) that lacks first, second and third singular and third plural present indicative forms, all present subjunctive forms, and the second singular imperative form Duplicate past participles: a number of verbs have two alternative forms, both correct, like impreso, imprimido (printed  without gender morphemes  Some nouns and adjectives present alternative correct forms for plural -e We support the idea that unification and feature-based morphology is more adequate for languages, such as Spanish and other Latin languages, that have alternative stems triggered by specific suffixes, missing forms in the paradigm, and duplicate correct forms Two-level morphology uses phonological rules and continuation classes (in the lexical component  We present some examples of dictionary entries: two verbal ending entries (allomorphs) for the past participle morphemes and two allomorph stems for imprimir, compatible with those endings The full inventory of such categories follows: w For complete inflected word forms wl For words (nouns and adjectives) that can accept a number morpheme Two-level morphology uses instead rules that match lexical representations (lemmas) with surface representations (actual spelling forms  vm For verb morphemes ng For nominal gender morphemes nn For nominal number morphemes For example, sing_1 means first person, singular number; while pres_ind means present tense, indicative mood The following examples show those contextual features both in nominal morphemes and in nominal lexeme entries: These entries allow the analysis/generation of the word forms presidente, presidenta, presidentes and presidentas for the lemma presidente; doctor, doctora, doctores and doctoras for doctor; and bamb, bambs and bambes for bamb In particular, inflected verb forms are analysed or generated by two rules The grammar rules are stated using the DCG formalism included in most Prolog implementations, thus we have used the DCG interpreter both for parsing and generating word forms
