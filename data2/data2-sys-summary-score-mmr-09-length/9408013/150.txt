 In contrast, the other collocation functions only make use of the training score to select the best analysis of a sentence, discarding the rest.  In order to make these trees compatible with the treebank and also to make them relatively insensitive to minor changes in semantic analysis, these QLF-induced trees simply consist of nested constituents with two categories, A (argument) and P (predication corresponding to constituents induced by QLF term and form expressions respectively.  We vary the values of cj to minimize the sum, over all QLFs for all training sentences, of the squares of the errors in the approximation, Defining the error function as a sum of squares of differences in this way means that the minimum error is attained when the derivative with respect to each ck, , is zero.
