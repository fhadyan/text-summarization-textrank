 The multiple use of semantic contributions results from viewing dependencies in f-structures as resources; in this way the one-to-one correspondence between f-structure relations and meanings is maintained.  Intuitively, however, the need for the multiple use of an f-structure meaning results not from the appearance of a particular lexical item (e.g a conjunction) or a particular syntactic construction (e.g parasitic gap constructions but instead results from multiple paths to it from within the f-structure that contains it, where structure sharing is motivated on syntactic grounds.
