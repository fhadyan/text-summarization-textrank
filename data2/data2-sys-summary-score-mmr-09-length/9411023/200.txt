 An intra-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation units are sentences, and an inter-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation units are paragraphs.  , the structure candidates which contain the substructure [3 [EG] 4 [EX] 5] [SR] 6 , which says sentence six is the entailment of sentence four and five only, are penalized.  If the text is written loosely, the rhetorical structure generally contains many BothNucleus relations (e.g parallel(mata(and, also and the system cannot gradate the penalties and cannot reduce sentences smoothly.  In Fig.  To realize a domain-independent abstract generation system, a computational theory for analyzing linguistic discourse structure and its practical procedure must be established.  As for the editorial articles, The average correspondence rates of the key sentence and the most important key sentence among the subjects were 60% and 60% respectively.  As for the technical papers, the average length ratio( abstract/original ) was 24 and the coverage of the key sentence and the most important key sentence were 51% and 74% respectively.
