 Viewing the LFG ontology in such terms does no violence to intuition: indeed, as we shall see, a more direct mathematical embodiment of the LFG universe can hardly be imagined.  Firstly, we believe that there are practical reasons for interest in grammatical specification languages: formal specification seems important (perhaps essential) if robust large scale grammars are to be defined and maintained.  A lexical functional grammar consists of three main components: a set of context free rules annotated with schemata, a set of well formedness conditions on feature structures, and a lexicon.  Our language is called and its primitive symbols (with respect to a given signature ) consists of (1) all items in Cat and Atom (2) two constants, c-struct and f-struct, (3) the Boolean connectives (true, false, , , , etc (4) three tree modalities , and , (5) a modality , for each feature , (6) a synchronisation modality , (7) a path equality constructor , together with (8) the brackets ) and
