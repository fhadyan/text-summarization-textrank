 Here, although universal quantifiers are used to support the extraction of properties representing the meanings of the restriction and scope (the variables R and S in the determiner lexical entries the blocking of the unwanted reading follows from the propositional structure of the glue formulas, specifically the nested linear implications.  The semantic information in a lexical entry, which we will call the semantic contribution of the entry, is a linear-logic formula that constrains the association between semantic structures projected from the f-structures mentioned in the lexical entry , and their semantic interpretations.
