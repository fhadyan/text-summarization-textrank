 rational debate.  Since As is given, 1/P(As) is a constant which can be ignored in finding the maximum of P(Wt | As   We can thus use these sequencing parameters directly in our overall model.  Unlabeled graphs are just like our relation edge graphs except that the nodes are not labeled with words (the edges still have relation labels   To apply a derivation step we need a notion of graph matching that respects edge labels: g is an isomorphism (modulo node labels) from a graph G to a graph H if g is a one-one and onto function from the nodes of G to the nodes of H such that iff .  In particular, we preserved the notion of hierarchical phrase structure.  1992   The syntactic rules in Gsyn relate `category' predicates c0, c1, c2holding of a string and two spanning substrings (we limit the rules here to two daughters for simplicity (Here, and subsequently, variables like s0 and s1 are implicitly universally quantified Gsyn also includes lexical axioms for particular strings wconsisting of single words: c1(w
