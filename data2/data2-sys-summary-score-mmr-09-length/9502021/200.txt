 In this derivation tree, the node labelled is a distinguished descendant of the root and is the first point below at which the top symbol ( ) of the (unbounded) stack is exposed.  We have also briefly outlined the sense in which partial linearity gives rise to context-freeness in derivations and sketched how this can be exploited in order to obtain a tractable recognition algorithm.  Finally, we note that acyclic feature structures without re-entrancy can be viewed as trees with branches labelled by feature names and atomic values only found at leaf nodes (interior nodes being unlabelled   Rather than giving such prominence to the root feature structure, we suggest that the entire derivation tree should be seen as the object that is derived from the input, i.e this is what the parser returns.  Slightly more generally, pltg can generate the language for any and context-free language L.  Thus, rather than storing the whole of the potentially unbounded stack in a particular array entry, it suffices to store just a bounded portion together with a pointer to the residue.
