 Before describing how we adapt this technique to the case of plpatr we discuss the sense in which plpatr derivations exhibit a context-freeness property.  Finally, we note that acyclic feature structures without re-entrancy can be viewed as trees with branches labelled by feature names and atomic values only found at leaf nodes (interior nodes being unlabelled   Rather than giving such prominence to the root feature structure, we suggest that the entire derivation tree should be seen as the object that is derived from the input, i.e this is what the parser returns.
