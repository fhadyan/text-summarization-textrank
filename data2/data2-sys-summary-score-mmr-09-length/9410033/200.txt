 Three features of the system are basically used for repair: First, input increments are uniquely associated with objects of VM-GEN, so that input modifications can be translated into modifications of the objects' states.  Unfortunately, input information can be insufficient in two respects: If the input structure for generation is provided by another AI-system, global problems in producing sufficient input information for the generator may occur, e.g because of translation mismatches in machine translation (Kameyama, 1991   Furthermore, we discuss how default handling can be adapted to multilingual generation, as required by the speech-to-speech translation system VERBMOBIL (Block et al 1992   There are two competing goals of incremental generation for spoken output, that must be taken into account when estimating the usefulness of defaults: Fluency: Long hesitations should be avoided during the production of an utterance, in order to be acceptable to the hearer.  A default description has the following form: The set of default preconditions defines tests that are applied to the given situation in order to find out whether the corresponding default body can be activated.
