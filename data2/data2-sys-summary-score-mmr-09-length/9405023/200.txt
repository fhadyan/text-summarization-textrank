 Further analysis showed that only 2 sentences had parses that were better than those selected by our integrated parse evaluation heuristic.  Shifting an input symbol from an inactive state is equivalent to skipping the words of the input that were encountered after the parser reached the inactive state and prior to the current word that is being shifted.  Due to the beam search heuristic and the ambiguity packing scheme, this set of parses is limited to maximal or close to maximal grammatical subsets.  Furthermore, our experience has shown that in many cases, ignoring an additional one or two input words may result in a parse that is syntactically and/or semantically more coherent.  The GLR* parser has a capability for handling common word substitutions when the parser's input string is the output of a speech recognition system.  Our goal was three-fold.  The results indicate that using the GLR* parser results in a significant improvement in performance.  When using the full heuristics, the percentage of sentences, for which the parser returned a parse that matched or almost matched the correct parse increased from 50% to 75
