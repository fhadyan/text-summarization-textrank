 A subsumption ordering over QLFS, , is employed in the evaluation rules, in effect to propose possible instantiations for meta-variables (the rule fragment only allows for scope meta-variables, but describes the more general case where other kinds of meta-variable are permitted   In the ellipsis is contained within a form expression whose category is This states the syntactic tense, aspect and polarity marked on the ellipsis (underscores indicate lack of specification   Briefly, the standard view within formal semantics, which DSP inherit, identifies semantic interpretation with composition: interpretation is the process of taking the meanings of various constituents and composing them together to form the meaning of the whole.  Preserving Information: Focusing exclusively on the results of semantic composition, i.e.  The equation ex5 is solved by setting ?P to something that takes a term T as an argument and substitutes T for and the index of T for throughout the ellipsis antecedent (the RHS of ex5 Here is a form of abstraction; for now it will do no harm view it as a form of -abstraction, though this is not strictly accurate.
