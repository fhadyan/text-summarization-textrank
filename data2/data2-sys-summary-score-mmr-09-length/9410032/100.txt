 Several similar attempts can be found in previous work.  Although top-down and bottom-up presentation activities are of a conceptually different nature, the corresponding communication knowledge is uniformly encoded as presentation operators in a planning framework, similar to the plan operators in other generation systems , , , .  The top-down presentation operators are roughly divided into two categories: schemata-based operators encoding complex schemata for the presentation of proofs of a specific pattern (twelve of them are currently integrated in PROVERB general operators embodying general presentation norms, concerning splitting proofs and ordering subgoals.
