 Since top-down presentation operators embody explicit communicative norms, they are given a higher priority.  Effects of this group of PCAs include: creating new attentional units, setting up partially premises and the goal of a new unit, closing the current unit, or reallocating the attention of the reader from one attentional unit to another.  Although top-down and bottom-up presentation activities are of a conceptually different nature, the corresponding communication knowledge is uniformly encoded as presentation operators in a planning framework, similar to the plan operators in other generation systems , , , .  The top-down presentation operators are roughly divided into two categories: schemata-based operators encoding complex schemata for the presentation of proofs of a specific pattern (twelve of them are currently integrated in PROVERB general operators embodying general presentation norms, concerning splitting proofs and ordering subgoals.
