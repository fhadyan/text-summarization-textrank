 In the running example, using the weighted sum of the phrase entropies as the node entropy, if any threshold value less than 1.08 is chosen, this will yield any desired coverage, since the single test example of Figure is then covered.  This can be done in several ways; one that has been tested is to select for each rule the RHS phrase with the least entropy, and prescribe that if a node corresponding to the LHS of the rule is chosen as a cutnode, then no node corresponding to this RHS phrase may be chosen as a cutnode, and vice versa.  In practice this was accomplished by compiling an and-or graph from the and-or tree and the set of selected cutnodes, where each set of equated nodes constituted a vertex of the graph, and traversing it.
