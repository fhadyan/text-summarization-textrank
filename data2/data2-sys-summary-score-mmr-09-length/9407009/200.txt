 Even if training and test sentences formally outside the domain are excluded from consideration, some sentences will still be more typical than others in that they employ more frequently occurring words, word sequences, constructions and concepts.  Many researchers working in the field of automatic spoken language understanding have made the informal observation that utterances hard for one module in an integrated system have a greater than average chance of being hard for other modules; this effect is sometimes referred to as synergy   One likely hypothesis which we felt needed investigation is that they are a simple consequence of the known fact that accuracy in general correlates strongly with utterance length, with long utterances being difficult for all processing stages.  Grammar specialization 497 of the 531 correctly recognized utterances receiving a QLF (93.6 passed grammar specialization; 54 of the 75 relevant incorrectly recognized utterances did so (72.0   Transfer and generation 428 of the 497 utterances with no upstream error received a good translation (86.1 67 of the 109 utterances with a correctable upstream error did so (61.5   The ratio of error rates is 2.8.
