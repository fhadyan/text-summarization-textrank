 (The generalization to allow for substitution as well as adjunction as a primitive operation both in this notation and the definition of derivation should be clear A formal definition for this operation is given by Vijay-Shanker [page 15]v87 and by Shieber and Schabes [appendix]full-alt-deriv.  The issue of how to handle multiple links impinging on the same node becomes relevant here, since the right end of the remaining link in the derived tree pair impinges on a node at which adjunction has just occurred.  Had the two links been rewritten in the other order link first, yielding the pair in Figure , and then link yielding the pair in Figure the generated logical form twice(int(blink(j describes two intentional acts each of single blinkings.  Recall that the standard definition of TAG derivation, due to v87, is hierarchically structured in terms of derivation trees, trees that serve to characterize the operations required to construct a particular derived tree, and hence its yield.  This exclusion makes the definition of the derived tree for a given derivation tree determinate.
