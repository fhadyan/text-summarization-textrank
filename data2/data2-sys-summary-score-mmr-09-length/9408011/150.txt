 Methods for automatically classifying words according to their contexts of use have both scientific and practical interest.  We would like to thank Don Hindle for making available the 1988 Associated Press verb-object data set, the Fidditch parser and a verb-object structure filter, Mats Rooth for selecting the objects of fire data set and many discussions, David Yarowsky for help with his stemming and concordancing tools, and Ido Dagan for suggesting ways of testing cluster models.  Given any similarity measure d(n,c) between nouns and cluster centroids, the average cluster distortion is If we maximize the cluster membership entropy subject to normalization of p(n|c) and fixed ( we obtain the following standard exponential forms for the class and membership distributions where the normalization sums (partition functions) are and .
