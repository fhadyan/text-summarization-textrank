 Among the promising avenues that occur to us are, firstly, the postulation of LF subscripts based on the four Qualia roles (assuming that these are the lexically most relevant aspects of noun semantics) and, secondly, the application of LFs to semantic (Qualia) structures rather than monolithic lexemes; eg: the LF Bon is used in delivering evaluative qualifiers which are standard expressions of praise or approval.  We consider one case briefly.  Lexical Functions abstract away from certain nuances in meaning and from different syntactic realizations.
