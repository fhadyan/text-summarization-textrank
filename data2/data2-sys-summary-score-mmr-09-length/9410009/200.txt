 Among the promising avenues that occur to us are, firstly, the postulation of LF subscripts based on the four Qualia roles (assuming that these are the lexically most relevant aspects of noun semantics) and, secondly, the application of LFs to semantic (Qualia) structures rather than monolithic lexemes; eg: the LF Bon is used in delivering evaluative qualifiers which are standard expressions of praise or approval.  The idea that all adjective collocates and all the verb collocates share an important meaning component roughly paraphrasable as intense and do respectively and the fact that the adjectives and verbs are not interchangeable but are restricted with this meaning to the accompanying nouns, is coded in the dictionary using lexical functions (in this case Magn and Oper   This treatment of collocations rests, among others, on the assumptions that there are only a limited number of lexical functions, that lexical functions can be assigned consistently, that all (or a significant number of) collocations realise a lexical function, that lexical functions are not restricted to particular languages, etc.
