 Many researchers have attempted several techniques to deal with extragrammatical sentences such as Augmented Transition Network(ATN) , network-based semantic grammar , partial pattern matching , conceptual case frame , and multiple cooperating methods .  The experiment says that our robust parser with heuristics can recover perfectly about 23 sentences out of 100 sentences which are just failed in normal parsing, as the percentage of no-crossing sentences is about 23.28   When adding to statesets, if state (p, j, f, e) is a candidate for admission to a stateset which already has a similar member (p, j, f, e and e' e, then (p, j, f, e) is rejected.  Heuristics 1: error types The analysis on 3,538 sentences of the Penn treebank corpus WSJ shows that there are 498 sentences with phrase deletions and 224 sentences with phrase insertions.  I was a last-minute ( read interloping ) attendee at a French journalism convention We will assign less error values( ) to the insertion-error hypothesis edges of nonterminals which are embraced by comma or parenthesis.
