 As it is to be used with real data, the formalism should be able to characterize the wide range of syntactic structures found in actual language use, including those normally excluded by competence grammars as belonging to the periphery of the language or as being ungrammatical   In this class of grammars every rule has the form A a B (A,B {non-terminals a {terminals and all trees have the simple structure : Or: equivalent vertical alignment, henceforth to be used in this paper, on the right) In probabilistic terms, a finite-state grammar corresponds to a first-order Markov process, where given a sequence of states Si, Sj   should not only contain information on the structural possibilities of the general language system, but also on details of actual language use in a language community This approach entails however that a corpus has first to be pre-analyzed (ie.  Therefore, when tuned to any particular language corpus the resulting grammar will be effectively finite-state.  one or more of the transitions necessary to find a parse path was lacking, even after generalizing the transitions.
