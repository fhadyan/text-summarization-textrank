 According to the hierachical structure of Japanese sentence shown in Fig.1 , the essential part of hierarchical structure of the following sentence ( ) is shown in Fig.2 .  , where SC and MC mean `subordinate clause' and `main clause' respectively.  To apply the centering theory that is originally for a sequence of sentences, namely discourse, we regard the subordinate clause and the main clause as a segment of discourse respectively.  One of them corresponds to VP, the other corresponds to VP + a certain kind of subject which is called objective subject Gunji proposed the more detailed structure, in which starting from predicate, say, verb and adjective, objects, voice, subject, aspect, tense, modality, topic and mood are or might be sequentially added to make an informationally more fulfilled sentence component.
