 We start by using features similar to those first investigated by Biber, but we concentrate on those that are easy to compute assuming we have a part of speech tagger (Cutting et al, 1992; Church, 1988 such as such as third person pronoun occurrence rate as opposed to 'general hedges' (Biber, 1989   Most commonly they combine easily computed text measures, typically average or sampled average sentence length combined with similarly computed word length, or incidence of words not on a specified easy word list (Chall, 1948; Klare, 1963   In spite of Chall's warnings about injudicious application to writing tasks, readability measurement has naively come to be used as a prescriptive metric of good writing as a tool for writers, and has thus come into some disrepute among text researchers.  The technique shows practical promise.  The project uses categories such as query comment announcement FAQ and so forth, categorizing them using parameters such as different types of length measures, form word content, quote level, percentage quoted text and other USENET News specific parameters.
