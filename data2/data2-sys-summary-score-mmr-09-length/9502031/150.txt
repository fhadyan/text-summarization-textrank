 Common endings are shared and category information is stored on the first unique transition.  The advantages of this compression are that (1) a word/morpheme is recognised (and category affixation rules (Grover, 1993) checked) as soon as the initial letters allow uniqueness, rather than at the end of the word, and (2) there is an immense saving of space.  * - X - * * - - * With the aim of evaluating the effectiveness of shallow processing, tests will be carried out to see what proportion of different types of errors can be dealt with elegantly, adequately and/or efficiently.  Preliminary tests used generated errors, from a program that produces random Damerau slips according to an observed distribution (Pollock, 1983 using confusion matrices where appropriate (Kernighan, 1990
