 Morphological Processing Spelling Checking The word in focus is first passed through a two-level morphological analysis stage, based on an adaption of (Pulman, 1991   The advantages of this compression are that (1) a word/morpheme is recognised (and category affixation rules (Grover, 1993) checked) as soon as the initial letters allow uniqueness, rather than at the end of the word, and (2) there is an immense saving of space.  * - X - * * - - * With the aim of evaluating the effectiveness of shallow processing, tests will be carried out to see what proportion of different types of errors can be dealt with elegantly, adequately and/or efficiently.  p.b.t s.  Parameters of the system will be varied, for example the breadth of the purview, the position of the purview focus, the number of correction candidates and the timing of their generation.  Preliminary tests used generated errors, from a program that produces random Damerau slips according to an observed distribution (Pollock, 1983 using confusion matrices where appropriate (Kernighan, 1990
