 Our technique segments continuous speech into words using only distributional and phonotactic information more effectively than one might expect up to 66% recall of segmentation points with 92% accuracy on one sample, which yields 58% recall of word types with 67% accuracy (the relatively low type accuracy is mitigated by the fact that most incorrect words are meaningful concatenations of correct words e.g `thekitty   This finding confirms the idea that distribution and phonotactics are useful sources of information that infants might use in discovering words (e.g Jusczyk et al 1993b   74-75
