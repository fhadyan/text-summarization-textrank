 Two sources of information that might aid speech segmentation are: distribution the phoneme sequence in cat appears frequently in several contexts including thecat, cats and catnap, whereas the sequence in catn is rare and appears in restricted contexts; and phonotactics cat is an acceptable syllable in English, whereas pcat is not.  Our technique segments continuous speech into words using only distributional and phonotactic information more effectively than one might expect up to 66% recall of segmentation points with 92% accuracy on one sample, which yields 58% recall of word types with 67% accuracy (the relatively low type accuracy is mitigated by the fact that most incorrect words are meaningful concatenations of correct words e.g `thekitty   Since sentence boundaries provide information about word boundaries (the end of a sentence is also the end of a word our input contains sentence boundaries; several studies (Bernstein-Ratner, 1985; Hirsh-Pasek et al 1987; Kemler Nelson, Hirsh-Pasek, Jusczyk Wright Cassidy, 1989; Jusczyk et al 1992) have shown that infants can perceive sentence boundaries using prosodic cues.  74-75
