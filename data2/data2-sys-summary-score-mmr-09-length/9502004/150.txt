 Memoization and reuse of partial results Incremental processing by addition of new items Hypothetical reasoning by keeping track of dependencies between items Best-first search by means of an agenda Like Earley's algorithm, all of these approaches operate top-down (backward chaining   In this paper, we present a bottom-up variant of Earley deduction, which we find advantageous for the following reasons: Incrementality: Portions of an input string can be analysed as soon as they are produced (or generated as soon as the what-to-say component has decided to verbalize them even for grammars where one cannot assume that the left-corner has been predicted before it is scanned.  non-directional basic categorial grammars   The following specification of the lookup relation provides indexing according to string positions as in a chart parser (usable for combination schemes 2, 3, and 4
