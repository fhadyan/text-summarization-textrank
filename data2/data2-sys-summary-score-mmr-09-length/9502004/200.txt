 It remains to be seen how bottom-up Earley deduction compares with (and can be combined with) the improved top-down Earley deduction of Drre , Johnson and Neumann , and to head-driven methods with well-formed substring tables , and which methods are best suited for which kinds of problems (e.g.  Memoization and reuse of partial results Incremental processing by addition of new items Hypothetical reasoning by keeping track of dependencies between items Best-first search by means of an agenda Like Earley's algorithm, all of these approaches operate top-down (backward chaining   In this paper, we present a bottom-up variant of Earley deduction, which we find advantageous for the following reasons: Incrementality: Portions of an input string can be analysed as soon as they are produced (or generated as soon as the what-to-say component has decided to verbalize them even for grammars where one cannot assume that the left-corner has been predicted before it is scanned.  The following specification of the lookup relation provides indexing according to string positions as in a chart parser (usable for combination schemes 2, 3, and 4
