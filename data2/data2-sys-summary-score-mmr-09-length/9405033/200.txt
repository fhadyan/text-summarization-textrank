 To assess the practical performance of the three unification-based parsers described above, a series of experiments were conducted using the ANLT grammar (Grover, Carroll Briscoe, 1993 a wide-coverage grammar of English.  The grammar provides full coverage of the following constructions: declarative sentences, imperatives and questions (yes/no, tag and wh-questions all unbounded dependency types (topicalisation, relativisation, wh-questions a relatively exhaustive treatment of verb and adjective complement types; phrasal and prepositional verbs of many complement types; passivisation; verb phrase extraposition; sentence and verb phrase modification; noun phrase complements and pre- and post-modification; partitives; coordination of all major category types; and nominal and adjectival comparatives.  Moore Dowding, 1991   Additional reasons for the relatively poor performance of the CE parser are the overheads involved in maintaining a sparse representation of the chart, and the fact that with the ANLT grammar it generates less densely packed parse forests, since its parse table, with 14% more states (though fewer actions) than the LALR(1) table, encodes more contextual distinctions (Billot Lang, 1989:146
