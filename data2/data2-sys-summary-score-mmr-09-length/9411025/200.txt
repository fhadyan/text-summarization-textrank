 Our notion of typing is similar to the one adopted in the Comprehensive Unification Formalism ( CUF in that it adopts an open-world semantics, and two types are considered as consistent unless they are explicitly declared to be disjoint.  Figure shows a systemic classification network for English pronouns taken from .  For each type X at the right-hand side of a disjunctive entry condition, we introduce two new types, X' for the original type, and for its negation.  In contrast, in our type system, the Prolog term translation has at most 8 nodes in the worst case, as in the following term which encodes the subjective case masculine (third person singular) personal pronoun.  Given the need for multiple dimensions in lingistic descriptions, we believe that multi-dimensional type hierarchies will remain important even when their compilation into Prolog terms is not needed any longer because unification of typed feature terms will be built-in in future logic programming languages.  The multi-dimensional inheritance described in this paper is implemented in the system ProFIT , which translates programs containing typed feature terms to ordinary Prolog programs.
