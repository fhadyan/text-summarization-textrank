 This knowledge may be expressed at different levels of abstraction depending on the phenomena involved: selectional restrictions (SRs lexical preferences, col-locations, etc.  To estimate the probabilities of classes, not directly from the frequencies of their noun members, but correcting this evidence by the number of senses of those nouns, e.g In this way, the estimated function would be a probability distribution, and more interesting, nouns would provide evidence on the occurrence of their hyperonyms, inversely proportional to their degree of ambiguity.  An illustration of such a learning is shown in Figure , where the system, departing from the three examples of use, and knowing that prosecutor, buyer and lawmaker are nouns belonging to the semantic class SRs have been used to express semantic constraints holding in different syntactic and functional configurations.
