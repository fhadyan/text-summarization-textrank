 However, the equivalent of this kind of minimal types in untyped feature structure grammars are constants which can be used in a similar fashion for off-line optimization.  The optimal evaluation order of the right-hand side categories is found by comparing the maximal degree of nondeterminacy introduced by the evaluation of the individual categories with the degree of nondeterminacy the grammar is allowed to introduce: if the degree of nondeterminacy introduced by the evaluation of one of the right-hand side categories in a rule exceeds the admissible degree of nondeterminacy the ordering at hand is rejected.
