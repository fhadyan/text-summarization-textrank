 In view of the considerable computational overhead required to perform linguistic analysis on a large number of speech hypotheses, its worth is dubious.  This formula is a symmetric, logarithmic transform of the function (g + 1 g + b + 2 which is the expected a posteriori probability that a new (U, H1, H2, L) 4-tuple will be a good occurrence, assuming that, prior to the quantities g and b being known, this probability has a uniform a priori distribution on the interval [0,1
