 Instead of concentrating on linguistic engineering of theory-neutral, poly-theoretic, multi-applicable lexical representations combined with semi-automatic migration of lexical knowledge between different formats, we propose an approach in which a single inductive learning method is reused on different corpora representing useful linguistic mappings, acquiring the necessary lexical information automatically and implicitly.  In a broader context, the results described here argue for an empiricist approach to language acquisition, and for exemplars rather than rules in linguistic knowledge representation (see and Gillis et al.  for further discussion of these issues   Outside the linguistic mainstream, people like Skousen, Derwing, and Bybee stress that the analogical approach (as opposed to the rule-based approach) should receive more attention in the light of psycholinguistic results and new formalizations of the notion of analogy ( ; In cognitive psychology (e.g exemplar-based categorization has a long history as an alternative for probabilistic and classical rule-based classification, and finally, in statistical pattern recognition, there is a long tradition of research on nearest neighbour classification methods which has been a source of inspiration for the development of lazy learning algorithms.
