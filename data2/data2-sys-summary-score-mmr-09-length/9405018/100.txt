 Instead of concentrating on linguistic engineering of theory-neutral, poly-theoretic, multi-applicable lexical representations combined with semi-automatic migration of lexical knowledge between different formats, we propose an approach in which a single inductive learning method is reused on different corpora representing useful linguistic mappings, acquiring the necessary lexical information automatically and implicitly.  In a broader context, the results described here argue for an empiricist approach to language acquisition, and for exemplars rather than rules in linguistic knowledge representation (see and Gillis et al.  for further discussion of these issues   Consistency Heuristic.
