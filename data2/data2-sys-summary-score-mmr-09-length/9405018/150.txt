 Identification.  In a broader context, the results described here argue for an empiricist approach to language acquisition, and for exemplars rather than rules in linguistic knowledge representation (see and Gillis et al.  Another problem concerns long-distance dependencies, especially in syntax.  Outside the linguistic mainstream, people like Skousen, Derwing, and Bybee stress that the analogical approach (as opposed to the rule-based approach) should receive more attention in the light of psycholinguistic results and new formalizations of the notion of analogy ( ; In cognitive psychology (e.g exemplar-based categorization has a long history as an alternative for probabilistic and classical rule-based classification, and finally, in statistical pattern recognition, there is a long tradition of research on nearest neighbour classification methods which has been a source of inspiration for the development of lazy learning algorithms.
