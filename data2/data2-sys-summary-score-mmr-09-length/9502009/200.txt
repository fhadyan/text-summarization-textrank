 Finally, it seems that precision and abstraction ratios are in inverse co-relation (as precision grows, abstraction decreases   However, although the technique still seems far from practical application to NLP tasks, it may be most useful for providing experimental insight to lexicographers.  Using the WordNet hierarchy as a source of backing-off knowledge, in such a way that if n-grams composed by c aren't enough to decide the best sense (are equal to zero the tri-grams of ancestor classes could be used instead.  The second advantage is that as long as the prior probabilities, p(c involve simpler events than those used in Assoc, p(c|s the estimation is easier and more accurate (ameliorating data sparseness   A subsequent modification would be to estimate the prior, p(c from the counts of all the nouns appearing in the corpus independently of their syntactic positions (not restricted to be heads of verbal complements   Besides the intrinsic difficulties of this approach, it does not seem appropriate when comparing across different techniques for learning SRs, because of its qualitative flavor.
