 However, although the technique still seems far from practical application to NLP tasks, it may be most useful for providing experimental insight to lexicographers.  Using the WordNet hierarchy as a source of backing-off knowledge, in such a way that if n-grams composed by c aren't enough to decide the best sense (are equal to zero the tri-grams of ancestor classes could be used instead.  The second advantage is that as long as the prior probabilities, p(c involve simpler events than those used in Assoc, p(c|s the estimation is easier and more accurate (ameliorating data sparseness   Besides the intrinsic difficulties of this approach, it does not seem appropriate when comparing across different techniques for learning SRs, because of its qualitative flavor.  The NLP tasks where SRs utility could be evaluated are diverse.
