 In order to achieve tight integration, we adopt a relational view of X2MORF and encode the relation between surface string and lexical string directly without using finite state automata (for arguments supporting this approach cf.  is obtained.  Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG, PS1, PS2) can be viewed as a mono-level but multi-stratal theory of grammar, where different strata relate to different aspects of linguistic information, but are represented uniformly in feature logics.  Besides constraints enforcing simple structure sharing (e.g the Head Feature Principle given in Fig.
