 Furthermore, the conditional constraint syntax is not restricted to unary licensing principles but can also be used to express relations, such as fs_append/3 needed for implementing the Subcat Principle which appends two feature structure lists (Fig.  In order to achieve tight integration, we adopt a relational view of X2MORF and encode the relation between surface string and lexical string directly without using finite state automata (for arguments supporting this approach cf.  Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG, PS1, PS2) can be viewed as a mono-level but multi-stratal theory of grammar, where different strata relate to different aspects of linguistic information, but are represented uniformly in feature logics.  This is certainly linguistically appealing.  below   The second approach is taken by DMCAI CLP , a Prolog system whose unification mechanism is extended in such a way that the user may introduce interpreted terms and specify their meaning with regard to unification through Prolog predicates.  Well-typed unification of two feature structures is implemented via the constraint solving clauses mentioned above, taking into account type hierarchy and feature appropriateness (for a detailed description cf.
