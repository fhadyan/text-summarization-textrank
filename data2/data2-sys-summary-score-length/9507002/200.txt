Deleting a branch is done by specifying an incomplete copy: in the right hand side of an equation, after a subtree specification, a sequence of paths to eliminate is written into parenthesis, preceding each one with a minus sign..

Patterns in the left hand side of the rule are a sequence of characters and variables -that represent a regular-expression pattern declared in a rule header..
