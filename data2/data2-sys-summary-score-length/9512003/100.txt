 In the cache model, there are at least three possibilities for how the context is created so that pronouns in RETURN POPS can be interpreted: (1) The pronoun alone functions as a retrieval cue ; or (2) The content of the first utterance in a return indicates what information to retrieve from main memory to the cache, which implies that the interpretation of the pronoun is delayed; (3) The shared knowledge of the conversants creates expectations that determines what is in the cache, e.g..  88,89..
