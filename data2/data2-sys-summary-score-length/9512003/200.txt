 In computational theories of discourse, there are at least three processes presumed to operate under a LIMITED ATTENTION CONSTRAINT of some type: (1) ellipsis interpretation; (2) pronominal anaphora interpretation; and (3) inference of discourse relations between representations A and B of utterances in a discourse, e.g..  In the cache model, there are at least three possibilities for how the context is created so that pronouns in RETURN POPS can be interpreted: (1) The pronoun alone functions as a retrieval cue ; or (2) The content of the first utterance in a return indicates what information to retrieve from main memory to the cache, which implies that the interpretation of the pronoun is delayed; (3) The shared knowledge of the conversants creates expectations that determines what is in the cache, e.g..  88,89..  Using linear recency as a model of the limited attention constraint would mean that an antecedent for an anaphor is determined by a linear backward search of the text, or of a discourse model representation of the text inter alia..
