 Each word is (perhaps ambiguously) assigned a category and LF, and when the syntactical operations assign a new category to a constituent, the corresponding semantic operations produce a new LF for that constituent as well..  This technique is also used in the -reducer briefly mentioned at the end of the previous section, and a similar technique will be used here to implement coordination by recursively descending through the two arguments to be coordinated..  Before describing the implementation of coordination, it is first necessary to mention how CCG categories are represented in the Prolog We have shown how higher-order logic programming can be used to elegantly implement the semantic theory of CCG, including the previously difficult case of its handling of coordination constructs..  The CCG rules shown in Figure 1 are implemented in the system described in this paper..
