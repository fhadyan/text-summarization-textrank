 Each word is (perhaps ambiguously) assigned a category and LF, and when the syntactical operations assign a new category to a constituent, the corresponding semantic operations produce a new LF for that constituent as well..  Before describing the implementation of coordination, it is first necessary to mention how CCG categories are represented in the Prolog We have shown how higher-order logic programming can be used to elegantly implement the semantic theory of CCG, including the previously difficult case of its handling of coordination constructs..
