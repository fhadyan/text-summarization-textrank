 Many theories of semantic interpretation use -term CCG is a grammatical formalism in which there is a one-to-one correspondence between the rules of composition at the level of syntax and logical form..  Each word is (perhaps ambiguously) assigned a category and LF, and when the syntactical operations assign a new category to a constituent, the corresponding semantic operations produce a new LF for that constituent as well..  This technique is also used in the -reducer briefly mentioned at the end of the previous section, and a similar technique will be used here to implement coordination by recursively descending through the two arguments to be coordinated..  Before describing the implementation of coordination, it is first necessary to mention how CCG categories are represented in the Prolog We have shown how higher-order logic programming can be used to elegantly implement the semantic theory of CCG, including the previously difficult case of its handling of coordination constructs..  For example, it is a straightforward matter to transform the Prolog This work is supported by ARO grant DAAL03-89-0031, DARPA grant N00014-90-J-1863, and ARO grant DAAH04-94-G-0426..
