 The outline of procedures to acquire the collocational information is as follows: extract collocations of nouns from a corpus of four kanzi character words replace each noun in the collocations with thesaurus categories, to obtain the collocations of thesaurus categories count occurrence frequencies for each collocational pattern of thesaurus categories For each possible structure of a compound noun, the preference is calculated based on this collocational information and the structure with the highest score wins..  The structure of this paper is as follows: Section explains the knowledge for structure analysis of compound nouns and the procedures to acquire it from a corpus, Section describes the analysis algorithm, and Section describes the experiments that are conducted to evaluate the performance of our method, and Section summarizes the paper and discusses future research directions..  The reasons are as follows: In Japanese, kanzi character sequences longer than three are usually compound nouns, This tendency is confirmed by comparing the occurrence frequencies of kanzi character words in texts and those headwords in dictionaries..  There is a fairly large corpus of four kanzi character words created by Prof..
