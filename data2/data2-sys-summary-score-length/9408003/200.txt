 I call a finite sequence of attributes a path, and write for the set of paths..  [ Definition P is the path interpretation function under I iff [ I is an interpretation , P is a total function from to the set of partial functions from U to U, and for each , [ is the functional composition of ..  [ Definition F is a feature structure iff [ F is a quadruple , Q is a finite subset of , , is a finite partial function from the Cartesian product of Q and to Q, is a total function from Q to , and for each , [ for some , runs to q' in F, ] ] where runs to q' in F iff [ , , and for some , [ q=q0, for each i[n, [ is defined, and , and ] qn=q .  Thus, though is computationally expensive, Troll uses only during compilation, never during run time..  A signature provides the symbols from which to construct typed feature structures, and an interpretation gives those symbols meaning..
