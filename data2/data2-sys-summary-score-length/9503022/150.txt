 ProofBy induction on the length of a cycle..  In the next section we will present a fixed regular grammar..  Because S derives w, the feature structure associated with S does not contain contradicting information: 3) follows..  Lemma proves that this reduction f is computable in polynomial time..  The previous section shows the complexity of a feature theory does not provide an upper bound for the complexity of a unification grammar that uses this feature theory..  In general, it seems that the complexity of the combination of two problems is at least as hard as the complexity of these two problems in isolation..  This happens when the unification grammar formalism restricts the unification..  Thus the complexity results that have been achieved in the formalisms of feature theories are not immediately relevant for unification grammars used in computational linguistics..
