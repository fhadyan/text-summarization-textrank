 Once we start allowing discourse interpretation processes like those just discussed, the Underspecification Hypothesis is not sufficient to explain the Combinatorial Explosion Puzzle anymore..  First of all, the semantics of expressions such as that, for historical reasons, I call logical forms can be computed in a completely classical fashion using the storage mechanism , with the result that syntactic constraints on the available readings, such as the Scope Constraint , can play a role in determining the semantics of these objects, without the need for additional constraints such as the label ordering constraints used in UDRS ..  For example, the sentence The Santa Maria is a fast ship containing the degree adjective fast can be `made precise' (and assigned a definite truth value) either with respect to a context in which `fast' is interpreted as `fast for a modern ship in which case the sentence is false; or with respect to a context in which `fast' is interpreted as `fast for a ship of her age in which case the sentence can be true or false, depending on the class of comparison..  86-87 .
