 As in that work, a discrimination net of root forms would be required; however, this could be augmented independently of spelling pattern creation, so that the flexibility resulting from not composing the lexicon with the spelling rules would not be lost..  stripping off possible (surface) affix characters in the word and locating a spelling pattern that they index; matching the remaining characters in the word against the surface part of the spelling pattern, thereby, through shared variables, instantiating the characters for the lexical part to provide a possible root spelling; checking any orthographic feature constraints on that root; finding a lexical entry for the root, by any of a range of mechanisms including lookup in the system's own lexicon, querying an external lexical database, or attempting to guess an entry for an undefined word; and unifying the root lexical entry with the root category in the spelling pattern, thereby, through variable sharing with the other category in the pattern, creating a fully specified category for the inflected form that can be used in parsing..
