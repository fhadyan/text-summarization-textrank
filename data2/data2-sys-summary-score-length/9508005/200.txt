 In practice, EBMT systems that operate at sub-sentence level involve the dynamic derivation of the optimum length of segments of the input sentence by analysing the available parallel corpora..  There are three key issues which pertain to example-based translation: establishment of correspondence between units in a bi/multi-lingual text at sentence, phrase or word level a mechanism for retrieving from the database the unit that best matches the input exploit the retrieved translation example to produce the actual translation of the input sentence [Brown 91] and [Gale 91] have proposed methods for establishing correspondence between sentences in bilingual corpora..  In this way, fws can serve the retrieval procedure with respect to the following two levels of contribution towards the similarity score of two sentences : Identity of fws of retrieved example and input (I) fws of retrieved example and input not identical but belonging to the same group (G) To obtain the lemmas and pos tags of the remaining words in a sentence, we use a part-of-speech Tagger with no disambiguation module, since this would be time consuming and not 100% accurate..
