 The performance of such assignment can be measured in: recall - the percentage of POSs which were assigned correctly by the guesser to a word; precision - the percentage of POSs the guesser assigned correctly over the total number of POSs it assigned to the word; coverage - the proportion of words which the guesser was able to classify, but not necessarily correctly; In our experiments we measured word precision and word recall (micro-average .  Not surprisingly, the coverage of morphological rules is much lower than that of the ending-guessing ones - for the suffix rules it is less than 40% and for the prefix rules about 5-6 .  For example: [booked (JJ VBD VBN [book (NN VB A[s [ed (NN VB) (JJ VBD VBN [undeveloped (JJ [developed (VBD VBN A[p [un (VBD VBN) (JJ The operator is applied to all possible lexicon-entry pairs and if a rule produced by such an application has already been extracted from another pair, its frequency count (f) is incremented..
