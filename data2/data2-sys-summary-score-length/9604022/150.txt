 The performance of such assignment can be measured in: recall - the percentage of POSs which were assigned correctly by the guesser to a word; precision - the percentage of POSs the guesser assigned correctly over the total number of POSs it assigned to the word; coverage - the proportion of words which the guesser was able to classify, but not necessarily correctly; In our experiments we measured word precision and word recall (micro-average .  The best thresholds were detected: for ending rules - 75 points, for suffix rules - 60, and for prefix rules - 80..  Evaluation of tagging accuracy on unknown words using texts unseen by the guessers and the taggers at the training phase showed that tagging with the automatically induced cascading guesser was consistently more accurate than previously quoted results known to the author (85 .
