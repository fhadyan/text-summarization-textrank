 The performance of such assignment can be measured in: recall - the percentage of POSs which were assigned correctly by the guesser to a word; precision - the percentage of POSs the guesser assigned correctly over the total number of POSs it assigned to the word; coverage - the proportion of words which the guesser was able to classify, but not necessarily correctly; In our experiments we measured word precision and word recall (micro-average .  So our next goal is to extract morphological rules with one letter mutations at the end..
