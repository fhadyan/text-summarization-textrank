The result of analysis is a list of lexical signs with translationally relevant relationships expressed by shared constants (indicated by integers in our notation 11 love12,1,3 mary13The transfer step uses the source side of the bilexicon (possibly expanded by bilingual lexical rules as described below) to derive a total cover of the SL list [221]gareyetal79 (a total cover is a division of a set into a number of allowed subsets such that every element in the set is a member of exactly one subset; we extend the term here to apply it to lists .  These rules may be seen as expanding the bilexicon in order to increase its coverage; under this view, they are somewhat analogous to lexical rules in that they reduce the number of bilexical entries that need to be explicitly listed..
