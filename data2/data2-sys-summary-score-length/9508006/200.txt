 The result of analysis is a list of lexical signs with translationally relevant relationships expressed by shared constants (indicated by integers in our notation 11 love12,1,3 mary13The transfer step uses the source side of the bilexicon (possibly expanded by bilingual lexical rules as described below) to derive a total cover of the SL list [221]gareyetal79 (a total cover is a division of a set into a number of allowed subsets such that every element in the set is a member of exactly one subset; we extend the term here to apply it to lists .  Other phenomena which may be loosely labelled multi-lexeme translations include: lexical gaps such as `piece of advice' - consejo ( support verb and category differences such as `to be thirsty' - tener sed (to have thirst) ( lexicalization patterns like `swim across the river Dee' - cruzar el ro Dee nadando ( conflational divergences as in `to stab someone' - darle pualadas a alguien ( .  Bi-lexical rules also serve to capture lexical, syntactic and semantic regularities in the translation between two languages by relating equivalent lexical processes cross-linguistically..
