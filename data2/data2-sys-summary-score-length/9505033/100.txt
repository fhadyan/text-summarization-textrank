 In the syntax used in this paper the constraint that a particular grammar rule can only be used for passive verbs would be expressed as below: This would result in the nonmonotonic sort: As seen by the definition of =c, the explanation for this nonmonotonic sort is postponed and is assumed to be computed after finding a parse for some sentence..  One could, for example, imagine cases where one would want different nonmonotonic rules to be explained after a completed parse, a generation, or after resolving discourse referents..
