 In the syntax used in this paper the constraint that a particular grammar rule can only be used for passive verbs would be expressed as below: This would result in the nonmonotonic sort: As seen by the definition of =c, the explanation for this nonmonotonic sort is postponed and is assumed to be computed after finding a parse for some sentence..  This alternate definition is useful for applications where the simplification of nonmonotonic sorts by each unification is expected to be more expensive than the extra work needed to explain a sort whose nonmonotonic part is not simplified..  However, this generalization is outside default logic..  Note that although the when slot in the definition of a nonmonotonic rule allows the user to define when his rule is going to be applied we will still have an order independent nonmonotonic unification operator..
