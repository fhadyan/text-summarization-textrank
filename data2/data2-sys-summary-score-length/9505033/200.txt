 In the syntax used in this paper the constraint that a particular grammar rule can only be used for passive verbs would be expressed as below: This would result in the nonmonotonic sort: As seen by the definition of =c, the explanation for this nonmonotonic sort is postponed and is assumed to be computed after finding a parse for some sentence..  One difference is that nonmonotonic sorts allow that the application of a nonmonotonic rule leads to fail, i.e..  This alternate definition is useful for applications where the simplification of nonmonotonic sorts by each unification is expected to be more expensive than the extra work needed to explain a sort whose nonmonotonic part is not simplified..  Immediate means that the nonmonotonic rule is going to be applied each time a full unification task has been solved or whenever all information about an object in the defined inheritance hierarchy has been retrieved..  Note that although the when slot in the definition of a nonmonotonic rule allows the user to define when his rule is going to be applied we will still have an order independent nonmonotonic unification operator..
