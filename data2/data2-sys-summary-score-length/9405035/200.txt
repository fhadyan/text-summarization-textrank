 The bilingual dual-coding theory proposes an architecture in which a common imagery system is connected to two verbal systems, and the two verbal systems are interconnected to each other via associative connections [Figure .  It depicts the verbal representations for two different languages as two separate but connected logogen systems, characterizes the translation process as the activation along the connections between the logogen systems, and attributes the acquisition of the representation to some unspecified statistical processes..  It can incrementally adapt to new experiences simply by adding new data to the training samples and modifying the associations according to the changed statistics..  There is a well-known debate in psycholinguistics concerning the bilingual mental representation: independence position assumes that bilingual memory is represented by two functionally independent storage and retrieval systems, whereas interdependence position hypothesizes that all information of languages exists in a common memory store..  The following example illustrates how the system selects the head anmelden for the German XCOMP sub-structure when it does the transfer from I] would I] like I] register for the conference to Ich] werde Ich] gerne] anmelden fuer der Konferenz .
