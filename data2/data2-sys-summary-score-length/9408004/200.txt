 The objections that linguists once held against statistical methods are disappearing slowly, partly due to results in corpora analysis that show the inadequacy of linguistic theory when applied to naturally occurring data..  Each proper branch is a binary branching structure, and so all grammatical constraints will need to be encoded locally..  These symbolic and statistical approaches are beginning to draw together as it becomes clear that one cannot exist entirely without the other: the knowledge of language posited over the years by theoretical linguists has been useful in constraining and guiding statistical approaches, and the corpora now available to linguists have resurrected the desire to account for real language data in a more principled way than had previously been attempted..  the main verbs were all from the set for which theta role data was obtained the examples were manually parsed by the authors..  the X-bar, theta, etc..  was kept constant..  While this is not an absolute limitation, in that it is theoretically possible to extract this information manually or semi-automatically from a corpus, time constraints entailed the rejection of this approach..
