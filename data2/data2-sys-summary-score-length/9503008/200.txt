 The parallel elements are `Bill' and `his wife the ellipsis equation is On the reading under discussion, the strict option is chosen; the property Q applied to the interpretation of `his wife' is: The resulting interpretation for the third conjunct is: Although we have described the derivation of the meaning for this example in terms of temporal ordering (we resolve the first ellipsis, using its result to resolve the second it is important to note that the analysis is truly order-free..  In the following example (due to parallelism of the heads of the main clause subjects forces a parallelism of arguments of the modifying relative clauses; John, the object of the relative clause in the source sentence, is parallel to Bill, the subject of the relative clause in the target sentence: The policeman who arrested John failed to read him his rights, and so, for that matter, did the one Bill got collared by..
