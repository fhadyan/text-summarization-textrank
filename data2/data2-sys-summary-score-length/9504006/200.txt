 We identified topic shifts in the following way: Five judges were presented with the four dialogues and in each of the dialogues we had marked where control shifts occurred..  Another focus of current research has been the modelling of speaker and listener goals (1, 3) but there has been little research on real dialogues investigating how goals are communicated and inferred..  In the cue words approach, Reichman (10) has claimed that phrases like because so and but offer explicit information to listeners about how the speaker's current contribution to the discourse relates to what has gone previously..  Each of these rules related control to utterance type: (a) For questions, the speaker was defined as being in control unless the question directly followed a question or command by the other conversant..  We also investigated whether there were occasions when prompts, repetitions and summaries failed to elicit the control shifts we predicted..  We considered two possible types of failure: either the speaker could give a cue and continue or the speaker could give a cue and the listener fail to respond..
