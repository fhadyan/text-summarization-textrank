 No one has yet shown that any robust parser is practical and useful for some NLP task..  Several robust parsing systems exploit the comparative success of part-of-speech (PoS) taggers, such as Fidditch (Hindle, 1989) or MITFP (de Marcken, 1990 by reducing the input to a determinate sequence of extended PoS labels of the type which can be practically disambiguated in context using a (H)MM PoS tagger (e.g..  The integration of text and PoS sequence grammars is straightforward and remains modular, in that the text grammar is `folded into' the PoS sequence grammar, by treating text and syntactic categories as overlapping and dealing with the properties of each using disjoint sets of features, principles of feature propagation, and so forth..  For example, the simplified rule for combining NP appositional or parenthetical text adjuncts is N2 ta] H2 Ta bal] The integrated grammar has been used to parse Susanne and the quite distinct SEC Corpus (Taylor Knowles, 1988 a 50K word treebanked corpus of transcribed British radio programmes punctuated by the corpus compilers..
