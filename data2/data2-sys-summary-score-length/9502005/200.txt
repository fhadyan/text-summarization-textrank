 The approach allows efficient bidirectional processing with similar generation and parsing times..  (1990 .  Empty or displaced heads present the principal goal-directedness problem for any head-driven generation approach (Shieber et al 1990; Knig, 1994; Gerdemann and Hinrichs, in press where empty head refers not just to a construction in which the head has an empty phonology, but to any construction in which the head is partially unspecified..  Though Gerdemann (1991) showed how to modify the restriction function to make top-down information available for the bottom-up completion step, Earley generation with top-down prediction still has a problem in that generating the subparts of a construction in the wrong order might lead to massive nondeterminacy or even nontermination..  The optimal evaluation order of the right-hand side categories is found by comparing the maximal degree of nondeterminacy introduced by the evaluation of the individual categories with the degree of nondeterminacy the grammar is allowed to introduce: if the degree of nondeterminacy introduced by the evaluation of one of the right-hand side categories in a rule exceeds the admissible degree of nondeterminacy the ordering at hand is rejected..
