 The system TAKTAG can provide the following two unique properties for desirable Korean tagging: 1) The system can provide accurate results even with the morpheme tagging which usually results in very poor performance, and 2) The system can be flexibly tuned to the new tag-sets without massive retraining..  The performance of the two-phase learning for tagging is determined how well the error-corrector can compensate the deficiencies of the statistical tagging, and in that sense, our TAKTAG is much successful since it increased the overall tagging results more than 10 .  Our POS tags, which are originally designed for morphotactics modeling in CYK-based Korean morphological analysis [ consists of the hierarchically organized 200 symbols that are refined from the seven major grammatical categories of Korean, which are nominal, predicate, modifier, particle, ending, symbol, interjection..  For single morpheme, a path name in the POS symbol hierarchy (e.g..  In these languages, a word consists of single stem morpheme plus several functional morphemes, and the POS tags should be assigned to each morpheme to best exploit the complex morphological structures..
