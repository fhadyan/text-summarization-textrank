 The system TAKTAG can provide the following two unique properties for desirable Korean tagging: 1) The system can provide accurate results even with the morpheme tagging which usually results in very poor performance, and 2) The system can be flexibly tuned to the new tag-sets without massive retraining..  The performance of the two-phase learning for tagging is determined how well the error-corrector can compensate the deficiencies of the statistical tagging, and in that sense, our TAKTAG is much successful since it increased the overall tagging results more than 10 .
