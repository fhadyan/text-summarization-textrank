 The process can be successfully applied to the problem-solving level because both the domain and problem-solving levels represent actions that the agents propose to do (at a later point in time for the domain level and at the current time for the problem-solving level however, the discourse level actions are actions that are currently being executed, instead of proposed for execution..  Notice that this model is essentially a recursive one: the Modify action in itself contains a full collaborative process an agent's proposal of a modification, the other agent's evaluation of the proposal, and potential modification to the modification! We capture this theory in a plan-based system for response generation in collaborative task-oriented interactions..  The domain level contains the domain plan being constructed for later execution..  For example, a consultant in a collaborative interaction must help the executing agent find the best strategy for constructing the domain plan, may initiate additions to the domain plan, and must negotiate with the executing agent when the latter's suggestions are not accepted (rather than merely agreeing to what the executing agent wants to do .
