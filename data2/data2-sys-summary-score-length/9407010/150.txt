 There were two main subclasses: either some important content word was substituted by an equally plausible alternative (e.g..  Coverage problem: The correct hypothesis was not in implemented linguistic coverage, but would probably have been chosen if it had been; alternately, the selected hypothesis was incorrectly classed as being in linguistic coverage, but would probably not have been chosen if it had been correctly classified as ungrammatical..  This formula is a symmetric, logarithmic transform of the function (g + 1 g + b + 2 which is the expected a posteriori probability that a new (U, H1, H2, L) 4-tuple will be a good occurrence, assuming that, prior to the quantities g and b being known, this probability has a uniform a priori distribution on the interval [0,1 .
