 Coverage problem: The correct hypothesis was not in implemented linguistic coverage, but would probably have been chosen if it had been; alternately, the selected hypothesis was incorrectly classed as being in linguistic coverage, but would probably not have been chosen if it had been correctly classified as ungrammatical..  Clear preference failure: The information needed to make the correct choice appeared intuitively to be present, but had not been exploited..  This formula is a symmetric, logarithmic transform of the function (g + 1 g + b + 2 which is the expected a posteriori probability that a new (U, H1, H2, L) 4-tuple will be a good occurrence, assuming that, prior to the quantities g and b being known, this probability has a uniform a priori distribution on the interval [0,1 .  The general CLE grammar was specialized to the domain using the Explanation-Based Learning (EBL) algorithm and the resulting grammar parsed using an LR parser , giving a decrease in analysis time, compared to the normal CLE left-corner parser, of about an order of magnitude..
