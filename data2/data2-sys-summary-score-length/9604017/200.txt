 The basic question attacked in this paper is the following one: can such a grammar be concretely useful if we want to process input from a specific domain? In particular, how can a parser that uses a general grammar achieve a level of efficiency that is practically acceptable? The central problem is simple to state..  The most immediate consequence is that much larger training corpora can be used before the specialized grammars produced become too large to be handled by the LR table compiler..  Table 2 indicates that EBL and pruning each make processing about three times faster; the combination of both gives a factor of about nine..  (The slight improvement in coverage with EBL on is not statistically significant .  Our interpretation of these results is that the technical loss of grammar coverage due to the specialization and pruning processes is more than counterbalanced by two positive effects..  The rules in the original, general, grammar are divided into two sets, called phrasal and non-phrasal respectively..  The resulting specialized grammars are forced to be non-recursive, with derivations being a maximum of six levels deep..
