 The basic question attacked in this paper is the following one: can such a grammar be concretely useful if we want to process input from a specific domain? In particular, how can a parser that uses a general grammar achieve a level of efficiency that is practically acceptable? The central problem is simple to state..  Our interpretation of these results is that the technical loss of grammar coverage due to the specialization and pruning processes is more than counterbalanced by two positive effects..  All the results presented above pertain to English only..
