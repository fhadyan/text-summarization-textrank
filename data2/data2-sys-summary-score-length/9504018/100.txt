 In our approach, similar syntactic translations give different semantic models when interpreted against different knowledge bases..  We achieve this using the following: a set of methodological principles that unify Meinong's philosophy with Grice's conversational principles; a rich ontology in the style of Hirst , which provides the possibility of having consistent models that contain objects belonging to different ontological spaces; an extension of stratified logic where the quantifiers are read under Lejewski's unrestricted interpretation which provides us the formal tool for expressing the above layers..
