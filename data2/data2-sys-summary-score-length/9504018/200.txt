 The ontology is enhanced with the eight types of existence listed by Hirst , though in this paper, we will deal only with physical existence, represented as E unactualized existence, represented as , existence outside the world but with causal interaction with that world, EOW and existence in fiction, F .  Russell does not say explicitly how this is supposed to happen..  We achieve this using the following: a set of methodological principles that unify Meinong's philosophy with Grice's conversational principles; a rich ontology in the style of Hirst , which provides the possibility of having consistent models that contain objects belonging to different ontological spaces; an extension of stratified logic where the quantifiers are read under Lejewski's unrestricted interpretation which provides us the formal tool for expressing the above layers..  One can see that this definition of satisfiability has two major advantages: on one hand, the relation provides a high degree of liberty in satisfying sets of formulas that contain positive and negative information of different strengths; on the other hand the relation is able to signal when such a contradiction occurs..
