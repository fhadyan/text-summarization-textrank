 Note that the mutation operation in the genetic search program treats each bit in the parameter encodings equally, while the perturbation operation in the annealing search program is sensitive to the distinction between more significant vs..  less significant bits..  The performance results were encouraging and demonstrate the promise of automated tone transcription..  My hypothesis is that this technique produces more consistent volume (and hence, pitch scaling) over long utterances and may make informants less self-conscious about speaking loudly than simply asking them to imagine speaking to subjects at various distances away..
