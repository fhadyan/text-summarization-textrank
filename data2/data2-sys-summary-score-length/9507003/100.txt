 In several types of parsers, rule applications create rather than discard ambiguities: the more processing, the less unambiguous information Parsing as disambiguation can well be extended to deal with fully specified dependency structures without loosing its promising characteristics..  Since structural disambiguation by constraint satisfaction likewise lends itself to the creation of time sensitive parsing procedures , in the long run it might provide a unifying foundation to build language processing systems upon which embody aspects of robustness against such different disruptive factors as syntactically ill-formed input, metaphorical use and dynamic time constraints..
