 It is determined which trees are auxiliary trees, and then the relationships between the SFs associated with the root and foot in these auxiliary trees are recorded..  Ditransitive Verb From this lexical entry, we can derive in the first phase a fully saturated initial tree by applying first the lexical slash-termination rule, and then the head-complement head-subject and filler-head-rule..  Therefore, a procedure that compiles HPSG to TAG can be seen as performing significant portions of an HPSG derivation at compile-time, so that the structures projected from lexical items do not need to be derived at run-time..  We do not assume atomic labelling of nodes, unlike traditional TAG, where the root and foot nodes of an auxiliary tree are assumed to be labelled identically..  Our translation process yields a lexicalized feature-based TAG in which feature structures are associated with nodes in the frontier of trees and two feature structures (top and bottom) with nodes in the interior..  A tree is an auxiliary tree if the root and some frontier node (which becomes the foot node) have some non-empty SF value in common..
