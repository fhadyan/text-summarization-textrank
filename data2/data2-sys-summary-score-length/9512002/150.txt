 As a general principle, it is advantageous to add a word to the grammar when its characters appear more often than can be explained given other knowledge, though the cost of actually representing the word acts as a buffer against words that occur only marginally more often than expected, or that have unlikely (long) descriptions..  Perhaps more importantly, because the algorithm constructs dictionaries from observed data, its entries are optimized for the application at hand; these sorts of dictionaries should be significantly better for speech recognition applications than manually constructed ones that do not necessarily reflect common usage, and do not adapt themselves across word boundaries (i.e..  The use of compression and prediction frameworks for language induction is quite common; Chomsky discussed them long ago and notable early advocates include Solomonoff ..
