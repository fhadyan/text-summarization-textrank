 Each of these evaluation efforts provided a corpus of news articles about a domain, a specification of the relevant information that was to be extracted from each article, the output representation of that information, and a set of key templates representing the information extracted from each article by human readers..  The last four features focus on the pair of references..  For example, if a text contains four relevant items (represented by {A, B, C, D} in an answer key and a system correctly extracts the three items {A, B, C} but incorrectly extracts the two additional items {E, F} (represented by {A, B, C, E, F} in a system response then its recall would be 75% and its precision would be 60 .
