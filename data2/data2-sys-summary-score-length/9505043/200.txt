 Each of these systems used a set of manually engineered rules to resolve some obvious types of coreference, but they tended to be very conservative, i.e they only considered phrases to be coreferent if there was overwhelming evidence in support of that hypothesis..  Until we can ascertain the relative importance of high recall vs..

For example, if a text contains four relevant items (represented by {A, B, C, D} in an answer key and a system correctly extracts the three items {A, B, C} but incorrectly extracts the two additional items {E, F} (represented by {A, B, C, E, F} in a system response then its recall would be 75% and its precision would be 60 .
