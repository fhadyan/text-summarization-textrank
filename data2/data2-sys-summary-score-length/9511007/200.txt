 (Recall that s(w) denotes the set of concepts in the taxonomy that represent senses of word w Note that the conversion from a distance to a similarity can be viewed as an expository convenience, and does not affect the evaluation: although the sign of the correlation coefficient changes from positive to negative, its magnitude turns out to be just the same regardless of whether or not the minimum path length is subtracted from ..  The third point of comparison is a measure that simply uses the probability of a concept, rather than the information content: mbox rm sim rm p c c_1, c_2) = raisebox 1.5ex shortstack rm max small$c in S(c_1,c_2 left[ 1 rm p c) right] mbox rm sim rm p c w_1, w_2) = raisebox 1.5ex shortstack rm max small$c_1,c_2$ left[ mbox rm sim rm p c c_1,c_2) right end{eqnarray} gt; where c1 ranges over s(w1) and c2 ranges over s(w2)in ( .
