 This results in the following new rule which uses the seed for filtering directly without the need for an intermediate filtering step: s(P0,P,finite,SSem t\t\t\tmagic_sentence(decl(SSem t\t\t\tvp(P1,P,finite CSem SSem t\t\t\tnp(P0,P1,CSem .  Furthermore, the grammar is required to obey what I refer to as the dependency constraint: When a particular right-hand side literal can not be evaluated deterministically, the results of its evaluation must uniquely determine the remainder of the right-hand side of the rule in which it appears..  The facts, i.e passive edges/items, in figure resulted from semi-naive bottom-up evaluation which constitutes a dynamic bottom-up evaluation, where repeated derivation of facts from the same earlier derived facts (as in naive evaluation; Bancilhon, 1985) is blocked..
