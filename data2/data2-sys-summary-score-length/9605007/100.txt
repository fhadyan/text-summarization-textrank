 However improving our algorithm to process classical cases of cataphors, such as those in sentence 6, should not require major modifications, only change in the order in which the EEs are searched through..  For example, we saw that a solution to processing cataphors could be to reconsider the order in which the conceptual structures (elementary events beforehand) are searched..  For example, in the splitting of sentence 1 into two EEs (see below EE1 does not contain non-PRR pronouns because it is the initial EE of the whole discourse..
