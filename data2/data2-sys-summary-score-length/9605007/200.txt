 In the conceptual analyser, the general disambiguation module (GDM) deals with other ambiguities, like prepositional phrase attachment..  The state of the focus (content of the registers SFi The main assumption is that the anaphora resolution algorithm always applies to a single state, (Ri, Si , EEi, SFi) when resolving a given anaphor (Step 3) : a If several antecedents are still possible after the individual evaluation of the anaphor, Ri is then duplicated, in Rij, as many times as there are possibilities..  For example, we saw that a solution to processing cataphors could be to reconsider the order in which the conceptual structures (elementary events beforehand) are searched..  An evaluation of the proposed antecedents is performed using different kinds of criteria (syntactic, semantic, inferential, etc The focusing algorithm makes use of data structures, i.e the focus registers that represent the state of the focus: the current focus (CF) representation, alternate focus list (AFL) that contains the other phrases of the sentence and the focus stack (FS .
