 However improving our algorithm to process classical cases of cataphors, such as those in sentence 6, should not require major modifications, only change in the order in which the EEs are searched through..  The sentence 5 should require specific treatment, though..  For example, we saw that a solution to processing cataphors could be to reconsider the order in which the conceptual structures (elementary events beforehand) are searched..  An evaluation of the proposed antecedents is performed using different kinds of criteria (syntactic, semantic, inferential, etc The focusing algorithm makes use of data structures, i.e the focus registers that represent the state of the focus: the current focus (CF) representation, alternate focus list (AFL) that contains the other phrases of the sentence and the focus stack (FS .
