 The test set relative entropy decreases to a minimum at 206 clusters, and then starts increasing, suggesting that larger models are overtrained..  Moving further in the direction of class-based language models, we plan to consider additional distributional relations (for instance, adjective-noun) and apply the results of clustering to the grouping of lexical associations in lexicalized grammar frameworks such as stochastic lexicalized tree-adjoining grammars ..  We would like to thank Don Hindle for making available the 1988 Associated Press verb-object data set, the Fidditch parser and a verb-object structure filter, Mats Rooth for selecting the objects of fire data set and many discussions, David Yarowsky for help with his stemming and concordancing tools, and Ido Dagan for suggesting ways of testing cluster models..  Given any similarity measure d(n,c) between nouns and cluster centroids, the average cluster distortion is If we maximize the cluster membership entropy subject to normalization of p(n|c) and fixed ( we obtain the following standard exponential forms for the class and membership distributions where the normalization sums (partition functions) are and ..
