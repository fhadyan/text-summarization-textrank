 The evaluation described below was performed on the largest data set we have worked with so far, extracted from 44 million words of 1988 Associated Press newswire with the pattern matching techniques mentioned earlier..  We would like to thank Don Hindle for making available the 1988 Associated Press verb-object data set, the Fidditch parser and a verb-object structure filter, Mats Rooth for selecting the objects of fire data set and many discussions, David Yarowsky for help with his stemming and concordancing tools, and Ido Dagan for suggesting ways of testing cluster models..
