 We introduce the heuristic costs , considering the parallelism between syntactic cases and semantic roles, as follows: where represents a unifier of two DAG's: one's syntactic case is x and the other's semantic role is y..  There were four lexical items in the set, and they are duly organized to a sentence and s1 becomes a singleton..  Introducing free-ordered typed lambda-calculus, together with the notion of unification costs in types, we have shown the structuring of natural language syntax, by distributively represented types in random orders..
