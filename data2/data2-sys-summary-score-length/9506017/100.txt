 In this paper, I combine their account of pitch accent semantics with Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein's (1989) account of centering to yield insights into the phenomenon of pitch accented pronominals, and the attentional consequences of pitch accents in general..  It is a quantitative feature..  By combining Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg's (1990) analysis of intonational meaning with Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein's (1989) theory of centering in discourse, the attentional affect of pitch accents becomes evident, and the paradox of pitch accented pronominals unravels..
