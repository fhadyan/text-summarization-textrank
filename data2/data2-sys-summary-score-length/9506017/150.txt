 In this paper, I combine their account of pitch accent semantics with Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein's (1989) account of centering to yield insights into the phenomenon of pitch accented pronominals, and the attentional consequences of pitch accents in general..  As points out, failure to predicate has contradictory sources: the proposition has already been predicated as mutually believed; or, the speaker, but not the hearer, is prevented from predication (perhaps by social constraints or the speaker actively believes the salient proposition to be false..
