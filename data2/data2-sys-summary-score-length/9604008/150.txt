 However, unlike in the HMM case where the algorithm produces a simple state sequence, in the PCFG case a parse tree is produced, resulting in additional constraints..  For this paper, we conducted two sets of experiments: one using a minimally cleaned set of data, making our results comparable to previous results; the other using the ATIS data prepared by Bod, which contained much more significant revisions..  In the lower right corner we give Bod the absolute maximum benefit of the doubt: we assume he used a parser capable of parsing unary branching productions, that he used a very overgenerating grammar, and that he used a loose definition of Exact Match Even in this case, there is only about a 1.5% chance of getting the test set Bod describes..
