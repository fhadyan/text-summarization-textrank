 For this paper, we conducted two sets of experiments: one using a minimally cleaned set of data, making our results comparable to previous results; the other using the ATIS data prepared by Bod, which contained much more significant revisions..  The table is arranged from least generous to most generous: in the upper left hand corner is a technique Bod might reasonably have used; in that case, the probability of getting the test set he described is less than one in a million..  In the lower right corner we give Bod the absolute maximum benefit of the doubt: we assume he used a parser capable of parsing unary branching productions, that he used a very overgenerating grammar, and that he used a loose definition of Exact Match Even in this case, there is only about a 1.5% chance of getting the test set Bod describes..  We have also shown that previous results were partially due to an unlikely choice of test data, and partially due to the heavy cleaning of the data, which reduced the difficulty of the task..
