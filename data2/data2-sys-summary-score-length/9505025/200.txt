 Many have argued that discourse has a global structure above the level of individual utterances, and that linguistic phenomena like prosody, cue phrases, and nominal reference are partly conditioned by and reflect this structure (cf..  To quantify algorithm performance, we use the information retrieval metrics shown in Fig..  This suggests that hand tuning is a useful method for understanding how to best code the data, while machine learning provides an effective (and automatic) way to produce an algorithm given a good feature representation..  Initial phrase position was correlated with discourse signaling uses of cue words in ; a potential correlation between discourse signaling uses of cue words and adjacency patterns between cue words was also suggested..  As noted in , the NP features largely reflect Passonneau's hypotheses that adjacent utterances are more likely to contain expressions that corefer, or that are inferentially linked, if they occur within the same segment; and that a definite pronoun is more likely than a full NP to refer to an entity that was mentioned in the current segment, if not in the previous utterance..
