 Government and Binding Theory analyzes sentences with four distinct syntactic representations which are related by the general transformation move- ..  There is a formulation of ECP, due to Rizzi and based on his notion of Relativized Minimality , in which the role of indexation is largely eliminated..  With such extended characterizations one might establish upper bounds on the complexity of human language in general..  The possibility that such results might be obtainable is suggested by the fact that we find numerous cases in which the issues arising in our studies for definability reasons, and ultimately for language complexity reasons, have parallels that arise in the GB literature motivated by more purely linguistic concerns..  It includes binary predicates for the usual structural relationships between the nodes in the trees parent (immediate domination domination (reflexive proper domination (irreflexive left-of (linear precedence) and equality..  A tree domain is the set of node addresses generated by giving the address to the root and giving the children of the node at address w addresses (in order, left to right) , where the centered dot denotes concatenation..
