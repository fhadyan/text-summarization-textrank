 Government and Binding Theory analyzes sentences with four distinct syntactic representations which are related by the general transformation move- ..  Details of such an account are given in ..  With such extended characterizations one might establish upper bounds on the complexity of human language in general..  The possibility that such results might be obtainable is suggested by the fact that we find numerous cases in which the issues arising in our studies for definability reasons, and ultimately for language complexity reasons, have parallels that arise in the GB literature motivated by more purely linguistic concerns..
