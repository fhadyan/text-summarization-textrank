 Current researchers often assume that the Poisson distribution is close to the actual empirical distribution describing a given set of term frequencies and, despite the fact that term frequency data is not exactly Poisson distributed, the Poisson distribution of term frequencies is a useful approximation..  Scientific disciplines may exhibit a greater degree of variation between the rate of terms most likely to be used in an SL sense for those terms that are expected to be most characteristic of the SL vs..  None of the Sociology and History terms were marked, and 4.2% of the economics terms were marked, yielding an average number of marked terms for the humanities and social sciences of 1.4 .  If we accept these dictionary definitions as capturing the true meanings of the terms, then disciplines such as Physics do have more distinctive SLs than do disciplines such as Sociology and the hypothesis that SLs have the same degree of specialization is wrong..  The list of SL terms used in a discipline may include words that are not used (or are used very infrequently) in general language, such as the Physics term dipole .
