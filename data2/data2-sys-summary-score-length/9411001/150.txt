 Current researchers often assume that the Poisson distribution is close to the actual empirical distribution describing a given set of term frequencies and, despite the fact that term frequency data is not exactly Poisson distributed, the Poisson distribution of term frequencies is a useful approximation..  For example, it may include syntactic constructions that would be considered ungrammatical in general language, such as omitting verbs [ .  Scientific disciplines may exhibit a greater degree of variation between the rate of terms most likely to be used in an SL sense for those terms that are expected to be most characteristic of the SL vs..  New York: Routledge..  The list of SL terms used in a discipline may include words that are not used (or are used very infrequently) in general language, such as the Physics term dipole .  1986..
