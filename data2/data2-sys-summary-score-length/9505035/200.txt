 As a consequence of this combination of techniques, present excelent results tagging an English corpus with the Xerox Tagger and the constraint-based system ENGCG HREF 9505035.html#Karlsson94 gt;Karlsson et al 1994 .  Segmentation of the text into tokens is performed by means of graphic information like space characters and other delimiters..  These tagset size may be excesive, specially for a probabilistic tagger, but results obtained with our corpus show similar accuracy, with the value-added benefit for the tagged corpus of having the whole variety of morphosyntactic categories and subcategories reflected in it..  If we establish an open class including all nominal, adjectival, and verbal tags, the classes file will contain, along with this open class, the list of individual tags of the tagset, the default ambiguity class, several ambiguity classes formed by 2-tuples, 3-tuples, 4-tuples and a few 5-tuples and 6-tuples..  Words ending in a can, usually, be singular feminine adjectives or nouns, subjunctive present first and third person singular verbs, and indicative present third person singular verbs ADJGFS :NCFS :VLPI3S :VLPS1S :VLPS3S .
