 basic discourse constructions (cf..  In our construction grammar the representation of constructions is closely coupled with a semantic taxonomy..  We have validated this model by building prototypes of natural language interfaces..  At each step of the dialog, the semantic engine extracts information from the results of parsing to yield (at the end of the dialog At the end of the processing, another component of the program changes the format of this data, and schedules the meeting in an on-line calendar, xdiary..  In this paper, our aim is not to come with linguistic generalizations about universal structural properties of sentences (although, of course, we have nothing against them but to come with an effective method for natural language understanding, which in addition to computational effectiveness would also have some linguistic and psychological plausibility..
