 The model gives us a better handle on phenomena of real language than the standard approaches, such as syntax + semantics a la Montague..  We have validated this model by building prototypes of natural language interfaces..  At each step of the dialog, the semantic engine extracts information from the results of parsing to yield (at the end of the dialog At the end of the processing, another component of the program changes the format of this data, and schedules the meeting in an on-line calendar, xdiary..  In this paper, our aim is not to come with linguistic generalizations about universal structural properties of sentences (although, of course, we have nothing against them but to come with an effective method for natural language understanding, which in addition to computational effectiveness would also have some linguistic and psychological plausibility..  The first argument for the linking of forms, meanings and contexts is that it has been the experience of of many people working in the field of computational linguistics that combining syntactic and semantic information increases the efficiency and effectiveness of processing; e.g..
