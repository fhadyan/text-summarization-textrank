 Apart from the already mentioned work, related work includes investigations about membership constraints (e.g type analysis for untyped languages (Soft Typing) , , , constraint-based program analysis and the derivation of recursive sets from programs ..  This paper is structured as follows..  On the other hand it establishes yet another correspondence between unification problems arising from polymorphic type inference and unification based grammar formalisms: The most prominent one is the equivalence of type checking polymorphic recursion , with semi-unification , both of which are undecidable in general..
