 The extension of our algorithm towards feature trees is easily possible (see .  Apart from the already mentioned work, related work includes investigations about membership constraints (e.g type analysis for untyped languages (Soft Typing) , , , constraint-based program analysis and the derivation of recursive sets from programs ..  On the other hand it establishes yet another correspondence between unification problems arising from polymorphic type inference and unification based grammar formalisms: The most prominent one is the equivalence of type checking polymorphic recursion , with semi-unification , both of which are undecidable in general..  Note that some form of descending is necessary in order to derive the clash from the inconsistent constraint To consider trees with free variables as set of instances means that we need to compute intersections of such sets and to decide their emptiness..
