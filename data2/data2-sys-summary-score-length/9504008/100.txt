 Figure -b shows the segmented diphone recognition performance..  The SKOPE's various modules were programmed by our students: the phoneme recognition module by Kyunghee Kim Kyubong Baac, the morphological analysis module by EunChul Lee Wonil Lee, and finally the syntax analysis module by Wonil Lee..  In the speech recognition side, the recognition must be at phoneme-level for large vocabulary continuous speech, and the speech recognition module must provide right level of outputs to the natural language module in the form of not single solution but many alternatives of solution hypotheses..
