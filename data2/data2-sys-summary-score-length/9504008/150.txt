 This section demonstrates the SKOPE's performance in continuous diphone recognition, morphological analysis, and syntax analysis experiments..  To see the original performance of the morphological and syntactic analysis modules assuming no speech recognition error, we artificially made the phoneme lattices by mutating the correctly recognized phoneme sequences according to the phoneme recognizer's confusion matrix..  The SKOPE's various modules were programmed by our students: the phoneme recognition module by Kyunghee Kim Kyubong Baac, the morphological analysis module by EunChul Lee Wonil Lee, and finally the syntax analysis module by Wonil Lee..  In the speech recognition side, the recognition must be at phoneme-level for large vocabulary continuous speech, and the speech recognition module must provide right level of outputs to the natural language module in the form of not single solution but many alternatives of solution hypotheses..
