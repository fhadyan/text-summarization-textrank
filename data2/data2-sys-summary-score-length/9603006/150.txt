 Collocations present an area that is important both for lexicography to improve their coverage in modern dictionaries as well as for lexical acquisition in computational linguistics, where the goal is to build either large reusable lexical databases (LDBs) or specific lexica for specialized NLP-applications..  sg pl..  Brundage et al..  MI is a function well suited for the statistical characterization of collocations because it compares the joint probability p(w1,w2) that two words occur together within a predefined distance with the independent probabilities p(w1) and p(w2) that the two words occur at all in the corpus: MI(x,y) = log2( p(x,y) / (p(x)p(y) ) (for a more detailed description see Church et al..
