 Make does, however, occur more frequently in constructions which I will call LIGHT CONSTRUCTIONS, such as make a decision; they are mentioned under one name or another by linguists and style guide authors, and what characterises them is that the light constituent can be deleted (with some rewriting of the remaining text to retain grammaticality .  A consequence of this is to be able to choose the light verb that corresponds to a nominalisation in a light verb-NP complement construction the nominalisation's support verb (SV .  The more productive verbs (like make) rank higher on the list than less productive verbs (like bear this is combined with the local information so that the more productive verbs, for a particular nominal, are subsequently ranked more highly than by the local information alone..  However, if the relative frequency hypothesis is true, and the global information is an accurate reflection of the innate lightness of a verb, this will elevate the light verb over the `heavier' ones, which will be more likely to be associated with the concretised forms..
