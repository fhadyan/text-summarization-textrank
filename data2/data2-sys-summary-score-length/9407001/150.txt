 Furthermore, the conditional constraint syntax is not restricted to unary licensing principles but can also be used to express relations, such as fs_append/3 needed for implementing the Subcat Principle which appends two feature structure lists (Fig..  In order to achieve tight integration, we adopt a relational view of X2MORF and encode the relation between surface string and lexical string directly without using finite state automata (for arguments supporting this approach cf..  ) mediating between lexical string, surface string (with inserted null elements the pure (denullified) surface string and the feature structure of the morphological sign..  Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG, PS1, PS2) can be viewed as a mono-level but multi-stratal theory of grammar, where different strata relate to different aspects of linguistic information, but are represented uniformly in feature logics..
