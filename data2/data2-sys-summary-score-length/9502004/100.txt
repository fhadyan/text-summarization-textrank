 We have proposed bottom-up Earley deduction as a useful alternative to the top-down methods which require subsumption checking and restriction to avoid prediction loops..  In this paper, we present a bottom-up variant of Earley deduction, which we find advantageous for the following reasons: Incrementality: Portions of an input string can be analysed as soon as they are produced (or generated as soon as the what-to-say component has decided to verbalize them even for grammars where one cannot assume that the left-corner has been predicted before it is scanned..
