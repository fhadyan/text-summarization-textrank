 Table shows the results of our pp-attachment disambiguation experiment in terms of `coverage' and `accuracy Here `coverage' refers to the proportion (in percentage) of the test patterns on which the disambiguation method could make a decision..  Labs..  Labs..  MDL stipulates that the best probability model for given data is that model which requires the least code length for encoding of the model itself, as well as the given data relative to it..  (The algorithm used for MLE was the same as that shown in Figure , except the `data description length' replaces the (total) description length' in Step 2 Figure (a) plots the relation between the number of obtained noun clusters (leaf nodes in the obtained thesaurus tree) versus the input data size, averaged over 10 trials..
