 Okay..  Speaker A replies with an elaboration of the initial expression, and B finds that he is now confident, and so accepts the reference..  First, an agent must communicate that she has not understood a plan..  The system repeats the process until it can find no more goals to adopt, at which time it switches back to being the hearer and waits for a response from the other copy..  The agent constructs an initial referring expression plan in almost the same way as in Heeman and Hirst's system..
