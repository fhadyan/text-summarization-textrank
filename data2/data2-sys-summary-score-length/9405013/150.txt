 One particular situation in which this arises is in giving directions..  Speaker A replies with an elaboration of the initial expression, and B finds that he is now confident, and so accepts the reference..  One subject was required to get the other subject to rearrange his set to match the ordering of her set, and to do so through conversation alone..  First, an agent must communicate that she has not understood a plan..  The system repeats the process until it can find no more goals to adopt, at which time it switches back to being the hearer and waits for a response from the other copy..  The mental actions in the plan will encode only useful descriptions..  The agent constructs an initial referring expression plan in almost the same way as in Heeman and Hirst's system..
