 Okay..  Speaker A replies with an elaboration of the initial expression, and B finds that he is now confident, and so accepts the reference..  One subject was required to get the other subject to rearrange his set to match the ordering of her set, and to do so through conversation alone..  If the recipient finds the initial referring expression plan invalid, then the agents will collaborate in its repair..  First, an agent must communicate that she has not understood a plan..  The system repeats the process until it can find no more goals to adopt, at which time it switches back to being the hearer and waits for a response from the other copy..  The mental actions in the plan will encode only useful descriptions..  But, ideally, salience should depend on the context surrounding the referent..  For example, the height of a tall building would normally be salient, but not if it were surrounded by other tall buildings..  The agent constructs an initial referring expression plan in almost the same way as in Heeman and Hirst's system..
