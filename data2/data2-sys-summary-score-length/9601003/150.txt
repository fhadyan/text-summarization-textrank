 The trigger papers, and one reaction paper, are Sparck Jones Crouch: General Technology Assessment Netter: Technology Assessment for Written NL Applications Steeneken: Speech Technology Assessment Adriaens: User-Centered Assessment for RTD in Language Engineering King: Reactions to G..  The fifth and final question asked about the implementation of comparative assessment, attempting to see whether researchers supported a bottom-up scenario, where the evaluation exercise(s) would evolve out of the actual pilot applications funded under the first Language Engineering call in the Fourth Framework, or whether they supported a top-down scenario where an evaluation exercise would be defined in consultation with the community but independently of particular funded pilots..  Projects whose task structure includes a particular evaluation point are expected to employ the annotation relevant to that point as part of their internal assessment regime..
