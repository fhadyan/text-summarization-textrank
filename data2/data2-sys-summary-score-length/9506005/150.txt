 Unfortunately, what we usually find in the mapping business is a mixture of two more problematic cases: The physical tagset cannot support a distinction intended by the specification language, e.g..  , the correspondence specified by the dashed arrow introduces a hierarchical inconsistency, as it assigns a physical tag (VBN) to a class (con) that cannot be terminal because its daughters ( past and pres) already are..  Information input are tagging guidelines, if the source annotation scheme comes with a comprehensive description of the intended class semantics, or corpus queries otherwise, which is more time consuming..  A typical query (content verbs in infinitive or primary auxiliaries in past tense) to a specific corpus (here: UPenn) looks like this: Query] vtype=con vform=inf) | (vtype=prim tense=past .
