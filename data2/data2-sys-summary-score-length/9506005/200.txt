 Of course, there are limits: proposals for standard tagsets should be regarded as approaches towards a neutral platform between projects and different theories, rather than as ready-made tagsets that will never be changed..  Example: [pos = v (vform = fin | case gen is a syntactically correct, but ill-typed specification, as the Types v (Verb) and gen (Genitive) are not type compatible..  Specific lexical items can be reclassified, i.e..  , the correspondence specified by the dashed arrow introduces a hierarchical inconsistency, as it assigns a physical tag (VBN) to a class (con) that cannot be terminal because its daughters ( past and pres) already are..  Information input are tagging guidelines, if the source annotation scheme comes with a comprehensive description of the intended class semantics, or corpus queries otherwise, which is more time consuming..  A typical query (content verbs in infinitive or primary auxiliaries in past tense) to a specific corpus (here: UPenn) looks like this: Query] vtype=con vform=inf) | (vtype=prim tense=past .
