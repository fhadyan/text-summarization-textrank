 Second, to introduce explicit semantic constraints (e.g only generate a possessive pronoun for trigger-nouns that denote CLOTHING in the object position if the subject denotes a HUMAN these would stop pronouns from being generated unnecessarily..  We make it easier to correct for this during post-editing by tagging possessive pronouns generated by the proposed method as being less reliable than possessive pronouns generated from directly from possessive expressions in the source text or transfer patterns..  The accuracies and precisions achieved by the '93 version (which does not use the proposed method) and the '94 method (which uses the proposed method) for the generation of possessive pronouns in noun phrases headed by trigger-nouns are summarized in Table ..  The similar problem of determining article usage and noun phrase number has recently been approached in three ways: using expert-system-like rules to determine the referential property and number of nouns ; using heuristic rules based on the meaning of the Japanese sentence and the properties of the generated English to determine the referentiality and number of English noun phrases and using a Context Monitor to maintain contextual information dynamically ..
