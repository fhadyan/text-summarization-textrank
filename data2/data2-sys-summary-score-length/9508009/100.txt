 Some examples: (a) it could be assumed that all the bracketing for the strings is to the right thus favouring an incremental approach; (b) type reuse could be blocked at the level of the formulae, reducing the the computational cost of searches for label closure, since most of the calculi in the family covered by the system are resource sensitive; (c) priority could be given to juxtaposed strings for -rule application, etc..  However, non-determinism due to splitting in the proof structure still remains..
