 Each state transition from si to si+1 is an event; the history is made up of the answers to all of the questions at state si and the future is the value of the action taken from state si to state si+1.Each event is used as a training example for the decision-tree growing process for the appropriate feature's tree (e.g..  The SPATTER parser illustrates how large amounts of contextual information can be incorporated into a statistical model for parsing by applying decision-tree learning algorithms to a large annotated corpus..
