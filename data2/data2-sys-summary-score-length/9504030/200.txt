 For each parsed sentence in the tree growing corpus, the correct state sequence is traversed..  Each state transition from si to si+1 is an event; the history is made up of the answers to all of the questions at state si and the future is the value of the action taken from state si to state si+1.Each event is used as a training example for the decision-tree growing process for the appropriate feature's tree (e.g..  Regardless of what techniques are used for parsing disambiguation, one thing is clear: if a particular piece of information is necessary for solving a disambiguation problem, it must be made available to the disambiguation mechanism..  The SPATTER parser illustrates how large amounts of contextual information can be incorporated into a statistical model for parsing by applying decision-tree learning algorithms to a large annotated corpus..  By assigning a probability distribution to the possible choices, decision trees provide a ranking system which not only specifies the order of preference for the possible choices, but also gives a measure of the relative likelihood that each choice is the one which should be selected..
