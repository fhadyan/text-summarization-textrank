 Each state transition from si to si+1 is an event; the history is made up of the answers to all of the questions at state si and the future is the value of the action taken from state si to state si+1.Each event is used as a training example for the decision-tree growing process for the appropriate feature's tree (e.g..  each tagging event is used for growing the tagging tree, etc .  Regardless of what techniques are used for parsing disambiguation, one thing is clear: if a particular piece of information is necessary for solving a disambiguation problem, it must be made available to the disambiguation mechanism..  The SPATTER parser illustrates how large amounts of contextual information can be incorporated into a statistical model for parsing by applying decision-tree learning algorithms to a large annotated corpus..
