 In particular, TG/2 can be smoothly integrated with 'deep' generation processes, integrates canned text, templates, and context-free rules into a single formalism, allows for both textual and tabular output, efficiently reuses generated substrings for additional solutions, and can be parameterized according to linguistic properties (regarding style, grammar, fine-grained rhetorics etc .  For instance, suitable fragments of context-free grammars translated into TGL could be augmented by the domain and task specific properties needed..  A production rule may involve a direct mapping to surface forms (canned text require to fill in some missing portion from a surface text (template or induce the application of other rules (classical grammar rules) Early template-based generation methods have correctly been criticized for beeing too inflexible to account adequately for the communicative and rhetorical demands of many applications..
