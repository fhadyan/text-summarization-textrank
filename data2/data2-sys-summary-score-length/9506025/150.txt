 The 3-tuple (direction, morpheme type, process type) indicates direction (left, right, unspecified morpheme type (free, bound and the type of morphological or syntactic attachment (e.g affixation, syntactic concatenation, reduplication, clitic .  If syntactic composition is performed after morphological composition, we would get compositions such as [iyi [okumus ocuk or iyi okumus] ocuk which yield ill-formed semantics for this utterance..  Semantic composition is also affected by the interplay of morphology and syntax, for instance the change in the scope of modifiers and genitive suffixes, or valency and thematic role change in causatives..  As a computational counterpart of this idea, rather than treating morphology, syntax and semantics in a cascaded manner, we integrate the process models of morphology and syntax, providing semantic composition in parallel..
