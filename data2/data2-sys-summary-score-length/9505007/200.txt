 Definite Clause Grammar, DCG, (Pereira Warren 1980 with their CF-style rules, are not modular (in the sense above so will have to specify explicitly each ordering of constituents in a separate rule, which results in an intolerably great number of rules in parsing a free WO language (e..  Dahl 1984 where a rule with a gap may be viewed as a meta-rule, standing for a set of CF rules, free WO is more economically expressed, however, due the unnaturalness of expressing permutations by gaps, GGs generally are clumsy for expressing flexible WO, WO is not declaratively and modularly expressed, and GGs cannot be used for generation (being besides not efficiently implementable .  It is important to note that in GPSG the linear precedence rules stated for a pair of sibling constituents should be valid for the whole set of grammar rules in which these constituents occur, and not just for some specific rule (this "global" empirical constraint on WO is called the Exhaustive Constant Partial Ordering (ECPO) property .  Position constraints: is positioned first/last (e..
