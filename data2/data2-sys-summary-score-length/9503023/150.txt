 The underlying principle employed at each step is to take a sentence, or part of a sentence, and generate strings with the boundary markers of the syntactic constituent in question placed in all possible positions..  The highest output marks the winning node..  The theoretical ground for incorporating negative examples in a language learning process originates with the work of gold1, developed by angluin2..  He showed that, for languages at least as high in the Chomsky hierarchy as CFGs, inference from positive data alone is strictly less powerful than inference from both positive and negative data together..  If both positive and negative data is used, counter examples will reduce the postulated grammar so that it is nearer the real grammar..  In order to do this a number of subsidiary tasks will be addressed..  (3.2) .
