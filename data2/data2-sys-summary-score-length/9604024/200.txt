 Bag generation is a form of natural language generation in which the input is a bag (also known as a multiset: a set in which repeated elements are significant) of lexical elements and the output is a grammatical sentence or a statistically most probable permutation with respect to some language model..  Two assumptions are made regarding lexical-semantic indexing..  To show this, consider the test-rewrite sequence for Example : Test: dog barked the brown big Rewrite: barked the dog brown big Test: barked (the dog) brown big Rewrite: (the dog) barked brown big Test: the dog) barked) brown big Rewrite: the brown dog barked big Test: the (brown dog barked) big Rewrite: the big (brown dog) barked Test: the (big (brown dog barked) (terminate) In this sequence double underscore indicates the starting position of a moved constituent; the moved constituent itself is given in bold face; the bracketing indicates analysed constituents (for expository purposes the algorithm has been oversimplified, but the general idea remains the same .
