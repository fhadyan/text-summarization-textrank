 Compilation of the outer domains for these rules took approximately 37 minutes, and the resulting set occupies 40K of memory..  The following definition specifies how outer domains are used: Definition 4 A lexical sign Lex' is in the outer domain of Sign' iff there is a triple (Sign,Lex,Binds) in outer domains such that Sign and Lex unify with Sign' and Lex' respectively, and there is at least one pair [PathS,PathL] Binds such that Sign PathS unifies with Lex PathL..
