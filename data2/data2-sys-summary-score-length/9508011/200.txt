 Litman and Allen provide operators for the following discourse plans: INTRODUCE-PLAN: introduce a new plan for discussion CONTINUE-PLAN: execute the next action in a plan TRACK-PLAN: talk about the execution of an action MODIFY-PLAN: introduce a new plan by modifying a previous one CORRECT-PLAN: correct a plan IDENTIFY-PARAMETER: identify a parameter of an action in a plan Under our approach, the recognition of discourse plans is unnecessary..  Grice .  For example, although the constraints of Litman and Allen's IDENTIFY-PARAMETER discourse plan force the plan to be related to another plan that involves the parameter to be identified, IDENTIFY-PARAMETER does not explain why this information is desired; it does not capture that agents need to know parameters to be able to perform acts involving them..  It is formalized as follows: (1) [ (2) (2a) \t\t (2a1) \t\t (2a2) \t\t\t\t Clause (1) of the definition models Morgenstern's second observation, namely that agents do not need a recipe to perform a basic-level action, i.e one executable at will ..
