 Litman and Allen provide operators for the following discourse plans: INTRODUCE-PLAN: introduce a new plan for discussion CONTINUE-PLAN: execute the next action in a plan TRACK-PLAN: talk about the execution of an action MODIFY-PLAN: introduce a new plan by modifying a previous one CORRECT-PLAN: correct a plan IDENTIFY-PARAMETER: identify a parameter of an action in a plan Under our approach, the recognition of discourse plans is unnecessary..  For example, although the constraints of Litman and Allen's IDENTIFY-PARAMETER discourse plan force the plan to be related to another plan that involves the parameter to be identified, IDENTIFY-PARAMETER does not explain why this information is desired; it does not capture that agents need to know parameters to be able to perform acts involving them..  Moore and Paris have shown that a similar need exists in generation..
