 I also discussed some of the effects of resource bounds, ie..  Evidence of acceptance may be given explicitly, but acceptance can be inferred in some dialogue situations via the operation of a simple principle of cooperative dialogue: COLLABORATIVE PRINCIPLE: Conversants must provide evidence of a detected discrepancy in belief as soon as possible..  Harry's assertion in (9) simply paraphrases what was said in (7) and (8) and so it cannot be adding beliefs to the common ground..  This means that it is difficult for the speaker to verify when an action has achieved its expected result, and so giving and receiving evidence is critical and the process of establishing mutual beliefs is carefully monitored by the conversants..  So a mutual belief supported as an inference can get defeated by linguistic information..
