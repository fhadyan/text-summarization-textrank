 In this class of grammars every rule has the form A a B (A,B {non-terminals a {terminals and all trees have the simple structure : Or: equivalent vertical alignment, henceforth to be used in this paper, on the right) In probabilistic terms, a finite-state grammar corresponds to a first-order Markov process, where given a sequence of states Si, Sj .  \t\t .  Therefore, when tuned to any particular language corpus the resulting grammar will be effectively finite-state..  27 were parsed correctly, ie..
