 [S [NP1 John] [VP [V knows] [S2 [NP2the truth] [VP2 hurts Since the description before the processing of the disambiguating word hurts is a subset of the final tree description, the monotonicity requirement is satisfied..  Although Gorrell proposes a general principle to guide initial attachment decisions (Simplicity: No vacuous structure building and specifies the conditions under which unconscious reanalysis may occur, the model leaves unspecified the problem of how the system may be implemented..  For this, we intuitively require some means of inserting one tree description inside another..  Intuitively, the operation finds a node on the current tree description which matches the left attachment site of the projection of the new word, and attaches it, while inserting the root of the new projection in its place..
