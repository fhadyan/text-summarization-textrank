 N N(Smid 4..  This can be done in several ways; one that has been tested is to select for each rule the RHS phrase with the least entropy, and prescribe that if a node corresponding to the LHS of the rule is chosen as a cutnode, then no node corresponding to this RHS phrase may be chosen as a cutnode, and vice versa..  The nodes of the and-or tree must be partitioned into equivalence classes dependent on the choice of cutnodes in order to avoid redundant derivations at parse time..
