 presents a Bayesian grammar induction framework that includes such a factor in a motivated manner..  The goal of grammar induction is taken to be finding the grammar with the largest a posteriori probability given the training data, that is, finding the grammar G' where and where we denote the training data as O, for observations..  Our move set includes the following moves: Move 1: Create a rule of the form Move 2: Create a rule of the form For any context-free grammar, it is possible to express a weakly equivalent grammar using only rules of these forms..  We repeat this process, parsing the next sentence using the best grammar found on the previous sentences and then searching for the best grammar taking into account this new sentence, until the entire training corpus is covered..
