 All parameters are initialized randomly..  The goal of grammar induction is taken to be finding the grammar with the largest a posteriori probability given the training data, that is, finding the grammar G' where and where we denote the training data as O, for observations..  Our move set includes the following moves: Move 1: Create a rule of the form Move 2: Create a rule of the form For any context-free grammar, it is possible to express a weakly equivalent grammar using only rules of these forms..
