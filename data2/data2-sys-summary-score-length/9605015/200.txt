The syntactic rule-set for French covers nearly all the basic constructions of the language, including the following: declarative, interrogative and imperative clauses; formation of YN and WH-questions using inversion, complex inversion and est-ce que clitic pronouns; adverbial modification; negation; nominal and verbal PPs; complements to `tre and il y a relative clauses, including those with dont partitives, including use of en passives; pre- and post-nominal adjectival modification, including comparative and superlative; code expressions; sentential complements and embedded questions; complex determiners; numerical expressions; date and time expressions; conjunction of most major constituents; and a wide variety of verb types, including modals and reflexives..
