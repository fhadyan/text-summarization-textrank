 Of course, during unification nodes can become more specific and a chain of REF cells is added to the count, but the length of such a chain is bounded by the depth of the type hierarchy and path compression during dereferencing cuts it occasionally..  When designing the control module, three parameters have to be set: the order of searching chart entries that can combine with a complete edge e; the order of searching active edges within this chart entry; and the search strategy: are all the edges that can combine with ecomputed first, and then their consequences (BFS or rather all the consequences of the first such edge, then the next etc..  (DFS .  Part of the work described herein was done while the first author was visiting the Seminar fr Sprachwiessenschaft in Tbingen, Germany..  Given a type t and a feature f, the position of the arc corresponding to f (f-arc) in any TFS of type t can be statically determined; the subgraph that is the value of f can be accessed in one step..
