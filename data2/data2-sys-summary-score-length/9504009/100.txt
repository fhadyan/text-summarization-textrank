 When designing the control module, three parameters have to be set: the order of searching chart entries that can combine with a complete edge e; the order of searching active edges within this chart entry; and the search strategy: are all the edges that can combine with ecomputed first, and then their consequences (BFS or rather all the consequences of the first such edge, then the next etc..  (DFS .  The use of abstract machine techniques is expected to result in highly efficient processing..  See for the details..
