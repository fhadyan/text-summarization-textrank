 The behaviour of presuppositions of sentences of this form has traditionally been studied as part of the projection problem for presuppositions, which is concerned with describing the presuppositions of a sentence in terms of the presuppositions of its subordinate clauses..  The traditional definition of expansion rules is not suitable for presupposition because it specifies the alternatives in the minimal form that preserves soundness and completeness of the logical calculus..  Two issues need to be dealt with: 1) how the presuppositions of a branch are ascertained from the presuppositions of the atomic propositions in it, and 2) how the presuppositions of branches of the same tableau interact..  By the Coverage Property, different branches wil have the same atomic propositions and they will differ only in that each atomic proposition may appear negated in one branch and appear unnegated in another..
