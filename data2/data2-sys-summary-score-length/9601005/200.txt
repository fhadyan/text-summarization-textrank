 The following examples suggest the feature of the similarity : \t\t (cat, \t\t pet) \t\t = \t\t 0.133722 , (cat, \t\t hat) \t\t = \t\t 0.001784 , (waiter, \t\t restaurant) \t\t = \t\t 0.175699 , (painter, \t\t restaurant) \t\t = \t\t 0.006260 ..  The following examples show the relationship between the word significance and the similarity: \t\t (waiter, \t\t waiter) \t\t = \t\t 0.596803 , (red, \t\t blood) \t\t = \t\t 0.111443 , (of, \t\t blood) \t\t = \t\t 0.001041 ..  Si is the word list which can be seen through a fixed-width window centered on the i-th word of T: \t\t Si= , \t\t \t\t l = (if , then \t\t \t\t r = (if , then .  Figure 2..  For example, the clear valley at exactly corresponds to the dominant segment boundary (and also to the paragraph boundary shown as a dotted line .  Text segmentation described here provides basic information for text understanding: Resolving anaphora and ellipsis: Segment boundaries provide valuable restriction for determination of the referents..
