 N N N .  The paper demonstrates that research in this area will have to rely on empirical data until complexity theory is developed to a point where it is sufficiently fine-grained and accurate to predict how the properties of individual unification-based grammars will interact with particular parsing algorithms to determine practical performance..  Dynamic storage minimisation, deferring structure copying e.g..  The grammar provides full coverage of the following constructions: declarative sentences, imperatives and questions (yes/no, tag and wh-questions all unbounded dependency types (topicalisation, relativisation, wh-questions a relatively exhaustive treatment of verb and adjective complement types; phrasal and prepositional verbs of many complement types; passivisation; verb phrase extraposition; sentence and verb phrase modification; noun phrase complements and pre- and post-modification; partitives; coordination of all major category types; and nominal and adjectival comparatives..
