 Bottom-up presentation operators are devised to simulate the unplanned aspect, where the next intermediate conclusion to be presented is chosen under the guidance of the local focus mechanism in a more spontaneous way..  Effects of this group of PCAs include: creating new attentional units, setting up partially premises and the goal of a new unit, closing the current unit, or reallocating the attention of the reader from one attentional unit to another..  Although top-down and bottom-up presentation activities are of a conceptually different nature, the corresponding communication knowledge is uniformly encoded as presentation operators in a planning framework, similar to the plan operators in other generation systems , , , ..  All of them have the following four slots: Proof: a proof schema, which characterizes the syntactical structure of a proof segment for which this operator is designed..  The top-down presentation operators are roughly divided into two categories: schemata-based operators encoding complex schemata for the presentation of proofs of a specific pattern (twelve of them are currently integrated in PROVERB general operators embodying general presentation norms, concerning splitting proofs and ordering subgoals..
