 However, it is worth noting that, in common with other DATR specifications, the lexical rules presented here are rule instances which can only be applied once to any given lexeme - multiple application could be supported, by making multiple instances inherit from some common rule specification, but in our current treatment such instances would require different rule names..  The key differences between our account and his are (i) that we have been able to use an existing lexical knowledge representation language, rather than designing a formal system that is specific to LTAG, and (ii) that we have expressed our lexical rules in exactly the same language as that we have used to define the hierarchy, rather than invoking two quite different formal systems..  which metarules are applicable for this entry (1993,126 .  The principal unit of (syntactic) information associated with an LTAG entry is a tree structure in which the tree nodes are labeled with syntactic categories and feature information and there is at least one leaf node labeled with a lexical category (such lexical leaf nodes are known as anchors .
