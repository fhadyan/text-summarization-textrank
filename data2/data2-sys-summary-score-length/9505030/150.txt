 The key differences between our account and his are (i) that we have been able to use an existing lexical knowledge representation language, rather than designing a formal system that is specific to LTAG, and (ii) that we have expressed our lexical rules in exactly the same language as that we have used to define the hierarchy, rather than invoking two quite different formal systems..  However, he does suggest a way in which the hierarchy could be completely replaced by metarules but argues against adopting it (1993,136 .  The principal unit of (syntactic) information associated with an LTAG entry is a tree structure in which the tree nodes are labeled with syntactic categories and feature information and there is at least one leaf node labeled with a lexical category (such lexical leaf nodes are known as anchors .
