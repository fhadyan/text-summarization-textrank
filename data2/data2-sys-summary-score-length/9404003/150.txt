 (The generalization to allow for substitution as well as adjunction as a primitive operation both in this notation and the definition of derivation should be clear A formal definition for this operation is given by Vijay-Shanker [page 15]v87 and by Shieber and Schabes [appendix]full-alt-deriv..  Had the two links been rewritten in the other order link first, yielding the pair in Figure , and then link yielding the pair in Figure the generated logical form twice(int(blink(j describes two intentional acts each of single blinkings..  Recall that the standard definition of TAG derivation, due to v87, is hierarchically structured in terms of derivation trees, trees that serve to characterize the operations required to construct a particular derived tree, and hence its yield..  Several aspects of this definition are noteworthy..
