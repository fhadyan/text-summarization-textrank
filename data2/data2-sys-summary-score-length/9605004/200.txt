 It is well known that Higher-Order Unification (HOU) can be used to construct the semantics of Natural Language: - henceforth, DSP - show that it allows a treatment of VP-Ellipsis which successfully captures the interaction of VPE with quantification and nominal anaphora; , use HOU to model the interpretation of focus and its interaction with focus sensitive operators, adverbial quantifiers and second occurrence expressions; shows that HOU yields a simple but precise treatment of corrections; Finally, uses linear HOU to reconstruct under-specified semantic representations..  More specifically, given (part of) an utterance U with semantic representation Sem and foci , we require that the following equation, the FSV equation, be solved: On the basis of the Gd value, we then define the FSV, written , as follows: This yields a focus semantic value which is in essence Kratzer's presupposition skeleton..  We then show that the POR can be extended to capture linguistic restrictions on other phenomena (focus, second occurrence expressions and adverbial quantification) provided that the notion of primary occurrence is suitably adjusted (cf..
