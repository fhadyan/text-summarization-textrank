 It is well known that Higher-Order Unification (HOU) can be used to construct the semantics of Natural Language: - henceforth, DSP - show that it allows a treatment of VP-Ellipsis which successfully captures the interaction of VPE with quantification and nominal anaphora; , use HOU to model the interpretation of focus and its interaction with focus sensitive operators, adverbial quantifiers and second occurrence expressions; shows that HOU yields a simple but precise treatment of corrections; Finally, uses linear HOU to reconstruct under-specified semantic representations..  Given these assumptions, the representation for (10) is and the corresponding FSV equation has two possible solutions In contrast, the representation for (11) is and the equation is with only one well-coloured solution Importantly, given the indicated colour constraints, no other solutions are admissible..  section .  section .
