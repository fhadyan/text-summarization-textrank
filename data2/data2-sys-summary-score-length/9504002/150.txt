 For confirmation, the list of French unknown words was given to a French grammarian, who predicted that it would be possible to make a good guess at the correct tag from the morphology for around 70% of the words, and could narrow down the possible tags to two or three for about a further 25 .  The problem of tagset design becomes particularly important for highly inflected languages, such as Greek or Hungarian..  The tests were run using Good-Turing correction to the probability estimates; that is, rather than estimating the probability of the transition from a tag i to a tag j as the count of transition from i to j in the training corpus divided by the total frequency of tag i, one was added to the count of all transitions, and the total tag frequencies adjusted correspondingly..
