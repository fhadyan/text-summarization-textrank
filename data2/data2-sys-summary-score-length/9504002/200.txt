 For example, in a variant of the English tagger which was not used in these experiments, a module which reduces the range of possible tags based on testing for only seven surface characteristics such as capitalisation and word endings improved the unknown word accuracy by 15-20 .  For confirmation, the list of French unknown words was given to a French grammarian, who predicted that it would be possible to make a good guess at the correct tag from the morphology for around 70% of the words, and could narrow down the possible tags to two or three for about a further 25 .  A smaller tagset may also mean that more words have only one possible tag and so can be handled trivially..  The tests were run using Good-Turing correction to the probability estimates; that is, rather than estimating the probability of the transition from a tag i to a tag j as the count of transition from i to j in the training corpus divided by the total frequency of tag i, one was added to the count of all transitions, and the total tag frequencies adjusted correspondingly..
