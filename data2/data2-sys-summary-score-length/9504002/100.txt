 For Swedish, 96% of the unknown words came from inflected classes, and had a single tag; for French the figure was about 60 .  The tests were run using Good-Turing correction to the probability estimates; that is, rather than estimating the probability of the transition from a tag i to a tag j as the count of transition from i to j in the training corpus divided by the total frequency of tag i, one was added to the count of all transitions, and the total tag frequencies adjusted correspondingly..
