 The experiments reported in the current article continue a line of research in the field of part-of-speech tagging using self-organizing models that was presented at the previous (9th) Scandinavian Conference on Computational Linguistics..  The Xerox tagger performs lexical generalizations by clustering words based on their distributional patterns, while the latter two utilize the morphological information present in Swedish by generalizing over word suffixes..  Some more numbers: in the running text, 54.5 64.2% of the words in the Teleman corpus are ambiguous, and only 44.3 48.9% in the Susanne corpus (small/large tagset, resp see Table for further details .  HMM approaches to part-of-speech tagging make the well-known assumption that the current category or part-of-speech of a word depends only on the previous (n-1) categories (Markov assumption thus they assume that natural language is a Markov process of order (n-1 which of course is not true, but a successful approximation..  The Teleman corpus is a corpus of contemporary Swedish, representing a mixture of different text genres like information brochures on military service and medical care, novels, etc..
