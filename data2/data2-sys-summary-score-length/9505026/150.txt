 These effects mainly arise from the higher morphological variation of Swedish which calls for additional strategies to be applied..  The Xerox tagger performs lexical generalizations by clustering words based on their distributional patterns, while the latter two utilize the morphological information present in Swedish by generalizing over word suffixes..  Some more numbers: in the running text, 54.5 64.2% of the words in the Teleman corpus are ambiguous, and only 44.3 48.9% in the Susanne corpus (small/large tagset, resp see Table for further details .  HMM approaches to part-of-speech tagging make the well-known assumption that the current category or part-of-speech of a word depends only on the previous (n-1) categories (Markov assumption thus they assume that natural language is a Markov process of order (n-1 which of course is not true, but a successful approximation..
