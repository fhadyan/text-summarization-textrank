 Among the criteria that were found to be most useful are the following: size of a DATR theory, measured by the absolute or average number of sentences per object (useful only for default theories) homogeneity of RHSs, measured by the number of different RHSs complexity of RHSs (length of paths and sequences) capturing of particular relationships such as relationships between objects (relative number of node references) relationships within objects (relative number of path references) An implementation of the approach has been applied to a number of different learning tasks, including the acquisition of German noun inflection (cf..  For an acquired DATR theory to be regarded as adequately characterizing a given set of observations it has to meet at least the following criteria (in addition to the general syntactic wellformedness conditions that hold for every DATR theory consistency with respect to the input data completeness with respect to the input data structuring of the observed data by inheritance relationships structuring of the observed data by generalizing them The first two of these criteria constitute minimal, formal requirements that can be verified easily..
