 The following paper presents an approach for automatic acquisition of linguistic knowledge from observations within a given domain; it thus addresses a topic from the field of machine learning (cf..  Among the criteria that were found to be most useful are the following: size of a DATR theory, measured by the absolute or average number of sentences per object (useful only for default theories) homogeneity of RHSs, measured by the number of different RHSs complexity of RHSs (length of paths and sequences) capturing of particular relationships such as relationships between objects (relative number of node references) relationships within objects (relative number of path references) An implementation of the approach has been applied to a number of different learning tasks, including the acquisition of German noun inflection (cf..  KL-ONE, cf..
