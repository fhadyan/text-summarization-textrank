 The language lacks many of the constructs found in general purpose, knowledge representation formalisms, yet it has sufficient expressive power to capture concisely the structure of lexical information at a variety of levels of linguistic description..  The provision of a formal semantics for DATR is important for several reasons..  The theory is said to be definitional if it consists solely of definitional sentences and it is said to be functional if it meets the following condition: There is a pragmatic distinction between definitional and extensional sentences akin to that drawn between the language used to define a database and that used to query it..  However, DATR's default mechanism permits any definitional sentence to be applicable not only to the path specified in its left-hand-side, but also for any rightward extension of that path for which no more specific definitional sentences exist..  Finally, the definition of in the theory of figure illustrates a use of the `evaluable path' construct: This states that the value of at is inherited globally from the path , where the dots represent the result of evaluating the global path (i.e..
