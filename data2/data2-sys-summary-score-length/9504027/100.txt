 For example, employs a chart to avoid recalculating the same combinations of signs more than once during testing, and proposes a more general technique for storing which rule applications have been attempted; avoids certain pathological cases by employing global constraints on the solution space; researchers such as and provide a system for bag generation that is heuristically guided by probabilities..  Average case complexity is dependent on the quality of the first guess, how rapidly the TNCB structure is actually improved, and to what extent the TNCB must be re-evaluated after rewriting..
