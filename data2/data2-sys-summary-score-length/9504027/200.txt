 For example, employs a chart to avoid recalculating the same combinations of signs more than once during testing, and proposes a more general technique for storing which rule applications have been attempted; avoids certain pathological cases by employing global constraints on the solution space; researchers such as and provide a system for bag generation that is heuristically guided by probabilities..  Average case complexity is dependent on the quality of the first guess, how rapidly the TNCB structure is actually improved, and to what extent the TNCB must be re-evaluated after rewriting..  The reason why we believe such improvement is possible is that, given adequate information from the previous stages, two target signs cannot combine by accident; they must do so because the underlying semantics within the signs licenses it..  The Shake-and-Bake generation algorithm of combines target language signs using the technique known as generate-and-test..  If we were continuing in the spirit of the original Shake-and-Bake generation process, we would now form some arbitrary mutation of the TNCB and retest, repeating this test-rewrite cycle until we either found a well-formed TNCB or failed..
