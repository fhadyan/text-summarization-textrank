 First, a particular intonational feature at the (e.g phrase-final lowering, phrase-initial pitch range expansion) can felicitously indicate more than one focusing operation; second, the intonation at a phrase boundary often indicates stack primitives (push, pop, null) more reliably than the composite focusing operations from which discourse structure is deduced..  These tokens are: The unfilled pause; The filled pause; A cue phrase; An acknowledgment form: Ok, Sure, Uh-huh, etc Or the unmarked case: any other sentence-initial grammatical constituent, e.g a noun phrase, auxiliary verb, complementizer or adverb..  A correlation of pause duration and the depth of embedding in the linguistic structure (or equivalently, the number of focus spaces still on the stack) showed no significant effect on pause duration (F(1,98) = 0.1861, p 7 .  Lines for helpful comments..  In the linguistic structure, the linear sequence of utterances becomes hierarchical utterances aggregate into discourse segments, and the discourse segments are organized hierarchically according to the relations among the purposes or discourse intentions that each satisfies..
