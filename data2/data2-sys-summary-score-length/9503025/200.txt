 This suggests, though further investigation is required, that distance vectors contain some different semantic information from co-occurrence vectors..  The actual definition for link length will be given later..  (There is a variety of neighborhood definitions such as 100 surrounding words and within a distance of no more than 3 words ignoring function words The logarithm with is defined to be 0 for an argument less than 1..  Since then, there have been some promising results from using co-occurrence vectors, such as word sense disambiguation , and word clustering ..  For example, Vronis and Ide used reference networks as neural networks, Hearst used (shallow) syntactic similarity between contexts, Cowie et al..  The results using distance vectors are shown by dots ( and using co-occurrence vectors from the 1987 WSJ (20M words) by circles ( .  show that the precision by using co-occurrence vectors are higher than that by using distance vectors except two cases, interest and customs..  The precision by using distance vectors increased to about 80% and then leveled off, while the precision by using co-occurrence vectors stayed around 60 .
