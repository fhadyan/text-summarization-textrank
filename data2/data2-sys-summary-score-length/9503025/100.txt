 using co-occurrence statistics..  (There is a variety of neighborhood definitions such as 100 surrounding words and within a distance of no more than 3 words ignoring function words The logarithm with is defined to be 0 for an argument less than 1..  Co-occurrence Vector..  The results using distance vectors are shown by dots ( and using co-occurrence vectors from the 1987 WSJ (20M words) by circles ( .  The precision by using distance vectors increased to about 80% and then leveled off, while the precision by using co-occurrence vectors stayed around 60 .
