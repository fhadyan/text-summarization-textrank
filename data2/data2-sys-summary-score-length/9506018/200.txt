 The PVI system is a fully-implemented system, although as yet limited to a small semantic domain..  This binary relation may be: mere inclusion, if the semantic constraint expressed by the case features is mandatory: C(a,b) is 1 if all features in a are present in b and have the same value, 0 otherwise, (this means that a good candidate must have all the semantic features expected from the functor a scaled product between the two sets if more or less acceptable solutions may be found, for example: C(a,b) is the number of features of a which are present and have the same value in b, divided by the total number of features in a, (this means that approximate solutions are allowed .  agent, object and recipient in the tree figure adjunction, for the optional functors (like, for example, if we had a locative complement in the example above or for a new predicative sememe for which an already generated sememe acts as functor (like, for example, a qualifying adjective .
