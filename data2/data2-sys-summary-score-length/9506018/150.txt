 Some potential users of the PVI system have neuromotor troubles which make the use of classical, widespread interfaces difficult for them..  This binary relation may be: mere inclusion, if the semantic constraint expressed by the case features is mandatory: C(a,b) is 1 if all features in a are present in b and have the same value, 0 otherwise, (this means that a good candidate must have all the semantic features expected from the functor a scaled product between the two sets if more or less acceptable solutions may be found, for example: C(a,b) is the number of features of a which are present and have the same value in b, divided by the total number of features in a, (this means that approximate solutions are allowed .
