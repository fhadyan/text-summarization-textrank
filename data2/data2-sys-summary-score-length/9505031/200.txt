 Let our first formal language L1consist of all sequences of SV (subject-verb SVO (subject-verb-object SVOO (subject-verb-object-indirect object of English taken from some very large corpus..  In contrast to the lexicalized grammar, in a grammar of constructions we can write a structural rule This rule defines a production saying that a new structure is obtained by adding a digit D to a previously defined structure DS1..  In this case the grammar production (phrase structure rule) reads: It can be easily checked that the resulting construction grammar is always an order of magnitude more compact than its lexicalized counterpart..  Moving to relevant work in computational linguistics, first let us notice that in some cases the strategy of describing language structure using only syntactic markers produces impressive results (e.g..  For instance PEG, a broad coverage grammar of English, , , used about 400 markers, including MONEY, DATE, PHONE, ANIMATE, HUMAN, RELIGIOUS/SMALL&gt NAME, TIME, TITLE, VERB/SMALL&gt OF/SMALL&gt COGNITION, VERB/SMALL&gt OF/SMALL&gt ASKING, DEROGATORY, EMPHATIC etc..
