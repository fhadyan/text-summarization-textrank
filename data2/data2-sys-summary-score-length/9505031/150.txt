 In contrast to the lexicalized grammar, in a grammar of constructions we can write a structural rule This rule defines a production saying that a new structure is obtained by adding a digit D to a previously defined structure DS1..  Also note that the latter must additionally refer to the function pos and exponentiation..  Moving to relevant work in computational linguistics, first let us notice that in some cases the strategy of describing language structure using only syntactic markers produces impressive results (e.g..  For instance PEG, a broad coverage grammar of English, , , used about 400 markers, including MONEY, DATE, PHONE, ANIMATE, HUMAN, RELIGIOUS/SMALL&gt NAME, TIME, TITLE, VERB/SMALL&gt OF/SMALL&gt COGNITION, VERB/SMALL&gt OF/SMALL&gt ASKING, DEROGATORY, EMPHATIC etc..
