 np(you, 2@agr .  Since the output of ProFIT compilation are Prolog programs, all the techniques developed for the optimisation of logic programs (partial evaluation, tabulation, indexing, program transformation techniques etc can be applied straightforwardly to improve the performance of sorted feature grammars..  A ProFIT program consists of: Declarations for sorts Declarations for features Declarations for templates Declarations for finite domains Definite clauses In addition to unsorted Prolog terms, ProFIT allows sorted feature terms, for which the sorts and features must be declared in advance..
