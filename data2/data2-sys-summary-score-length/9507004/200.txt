 The model presented is based on two basic principles: Empirical rigour: all and only correct forms are analysed and generated, whether regular or not; gaps in verb paradigms are observed; suppletive forms are considered valid, and so on..  The model could be used for derivative morphology and compounds as well, but this has not been done yet, since further linguistic analysis must be done to specify the features needed to permit derivatives and compounds..  crisis..  matemticas, (mathematics .  In contrast with verb morphology, nominal processes do not produce internal change in the stem caused by the addition of a gender or plural suffix, although there can be many allomorphs produced by spelling changes: luz, luc-es (light, lights .  With the combination of both features, and the addition of a third feature conj (conjugation we can state unequivocally which is the correct sequence of stem and ending for each case (see examples above, where imprim only matches ido for all features, and impres matches o, thus preventing ill-formed concatenations -for these morphemes- such as imprim-o or impres-ido .
