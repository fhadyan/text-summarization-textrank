 The addition of extra operations also means that, for any given reading of a sentence there will generally be many different possible derivations (so-called `spurious' ambiguity making simple parsing strategies such as shift-reduce highly inefficient..  The limitations of the parsing approaches become evident when we consider grammars with left recursion..  To represent a function which requires an np on the left, and an np and a pp to the right, there is a choice of the following three types using Curried notation: np s/pp np) (np (s/pp np np s pp np Most CGs either choose the third of these (to give a vp structure or include a rule of Associativity which means that the types are interchangeable (in the Lambek Calculus, Associativity is a consequence of the calculus, rather than being specified separately .
