 The addition of extra operations also means that, for any given reading of a sentence there will generally be many different possible derivations (so-called `spurious' ambiguity making simple parsing strategies such as shift-reduce highly inefficient..  Once the full set of possible lexical entries for a sentence is collected, they can, if required, then be converted back into a set of phrase structure rules (which should correspond to a small subset of the rule based formalism equivalent to the whole lexicalised grammar before being parsing with a standard algorithm such as Earley's (Earley 1970 .  1990 .  To represent a function which requires an np on the left, and an np and a pp to the right, there is a choice of the following three types using Curried notation: np s/pp np) (np (s/pp np np s pp np Most CGs either choose the third of these (to give a vp structure or include a rule of Associativity which means that the types are interchangeable (in the Lambek Calculus, Associativity is a consequence of the calculus, rather than being specified separately .  1990 .
