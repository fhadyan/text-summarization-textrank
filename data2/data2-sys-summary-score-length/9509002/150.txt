 If different techniques require different amounts of data to achieve a given accuracy, the architect would like to know what these requirements are in advance in order to make an informed choice..  The following argument leads to a fairly tight lower bound to G for suitably chosen values of kj (see below The first step rearranges the order of addition..  Since we can use the following relation: Letting we can simplify as follows: The last step introduces g and holds for all This is because in practice only the first few terms of the outer sum are significant..  The assumption that bin probabilities are uniform is problematic..  If commercial NLP systems are to be developed from the current batch of research prototypes for SLL, then a predictive theory of the data requirements of such systems is necessary..
