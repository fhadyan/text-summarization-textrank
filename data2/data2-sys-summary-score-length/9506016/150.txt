 Would there be a potential fit with the dynamic semantic theories in linguistics (e.g Kamp, 1981; Heim, 1982; Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1991) in a way that forms a basis for an integrated logical model of discourse semantics and pragmatics? In this paper, I propose a pronoun interpretation model taking ideas from both computational and linguistic traditions, and present it in such a way that it becomes tractable for logical implementation..  What additional kinds of conflict resolution inferences do we have then? There are two additional conflict resolution patterns observed in the present examples, which I will call the Indefeasible Override and the Defeasible Override, defined below: Indefeasible Override An indefeasible principle overrides a defeasible one: Defeasible Override Given an explicit overriding relation, one defeasible principle defeats another (even when ..
