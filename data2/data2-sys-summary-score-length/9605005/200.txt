 For instance in (2a-b the focus operator only associates with focus so that the difference in focus between (2a) and (2b) induces a difference in meaning between the two utterances: in a world where Jon introduced Paul to Mary and Sarah, and no other introduction takes place, (2a) is necessarily false whilst (2b) is true..  For data which is generally viewed as a test-bed for focus theory (utterances with multiple focus operators and second occurrence expressions we show that contrary to Rooth's and Krifka's theories, the HOU treatment yields a transparent analysis while avoiding under- and over-generation..  Utterances with multiple focus operators are known pathological cases of focus theory: In the given context, the preferred reading of (3b) can be glossed as follows: it is also the case for SUE2, that Jon only1 read the letters she sent to PAUL1 - i.e..  Peter..  Recall that in the Structured Meanings approach, the right-sibling of a focus operator must contain all and only the focus this operator associates with (cf..  section .
