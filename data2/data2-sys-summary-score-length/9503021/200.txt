 From a computational point of view it is of course most desirable to restrict oneself to a formalism that on the one hand gives enough expressibility to describe a large fragment of the (natural) language, and on the other hand is restrictive enough to preserve feasibility..  Definition thedefctr: A constituent structure tree (CST) is a labeled tree in which the internal nodes are labeled with elements of Cat and the leaves are labeled with elements of Lex..  Definition thedefctr: 1..  , p .150] A class of sets is recursively presentable iff there is an effective enumeration of deterministic Turing machines which halt on all their inputs, and such that 2..  Proof nIf L is a context free language, then there exists a context free grammar G' in Greibach normal form such that L=L(G .  Does there exist a tight relation between time bounded machines and R-AVGs as e.g between LBAs and CSLs? The answer is that the off-line parsability constraint that forces the R-AVG to have no chain- or -rules is just too restrictive to allow such a connection..
