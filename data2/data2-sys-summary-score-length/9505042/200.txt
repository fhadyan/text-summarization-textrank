 For example, to obtain data for the case in which the size of a discourse was 20 sentences, we examined 32 areas each consisting of 20 sentences, such as the 1st sentence to the 20th, the 51st to the 70th, and the 701st to the 720th..  On the assumption that this feature of words in a discourse provides a clue to improving the accuracy of sentence analysis, we conducted an experiment on sentences for which a syntactic parser generated more than one parse tree, owing to the presence of words that can be assigned to more than one part of speech, or to the presence of complicated coordinate structures, or for various other reasons..  After all the sentences except the ill-formed sentences that caused incomplete parses have provided data for use as discourse information, the parse completion procedure begins..  3 and 12..  (151st sentence) (3.3) Fig..  Two partial parses are joined if the root (head node) of either parse tree can modify a node in the other parse without crossing the modification of other nodes..
