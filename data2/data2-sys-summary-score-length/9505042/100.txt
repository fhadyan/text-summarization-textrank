 On the assumption that this feature of words in a discourse provides a clue to improving the accuracy of sentence analysis, we conducted an experiment on sentences for which a syntactic parser generated more than one parse tree, owing to the presence of words that can be assigned to more than one part of speech, or to the presence of complicated coordinate structures, or for various other reasons..  These matching conditions at different levels are applied in such a manner that partial parses are joined through the most preferable nodes..
