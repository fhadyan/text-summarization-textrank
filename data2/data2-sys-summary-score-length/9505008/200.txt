 It also activated DSS-DLC for CSA 3208 in 1994 Q3 Fig..  Because PLANDoc can produce many paraphrases for a single message, aggregation during the syntactic phase of generation would be difficult; semantically similar messages would already have different surface forms..  Based on the ranking, the system reorders the messages by sorting, which puts the messages that have the same attribute right next to each other..  2, equipment has rank 1 because it has 3 distinct equipment values - ALL-DLC, DLC, and DSS-DLC; date has rank 2 because it has two distinct date values - 1994 Q1 and 1994 Q3; site has rank 0..  Comparing the third message (E3 S4 D2) to (E1 S3 D2 they have different equipment and site, but not date, so a sentence break will take place between them..  Because of the parallel structure created between the first 2 messages, readers are expecting a different date when reading the third clause..  Extending the current aggregation algorithm to be more general is currently being investigated, such as combining related messages with different actions..
