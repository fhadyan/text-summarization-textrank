 Because PLANDoc can produce many paraphrases for a single message, aggregation during the syntactic phase of generation would be difficult; semantically similar messages would already have different surface forms..  This reduces the problem size from tens of messages into much smaller sizes..  2, equipment has rank 1 because it has 3 distinct equipment values - ALL-DLC, DLC, and DSS-DLC; date has rank 2 because it has two distinct date values - 1994 Q1 and 1994 Q3; site has rank 0..  Comparing the third message (E3 S4 D2) to (E1 S3 D2 they have different equipment and site, but not date, so a sentence break will take place between them..  Because of the parallel structure created between the first 2 messages, readers are expecting a different date when reading the third clause..
