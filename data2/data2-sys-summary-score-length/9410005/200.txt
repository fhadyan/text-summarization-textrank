 The interaction of centering with global focusing mechanisms and with other factors such as intentional structure, semantic selectional restrictions, verb tense and aspect, modality, intonation and pitch accent are topics for further research..  We rank the items in Cf by obliqueness of grammatical relation of the subcategorized functions of the main verb: that is, first the subject, object, and object2, followed by other subcategorized functions, and finally, adjuncts..  Friedman races her on weekends..  Of course the local approach described here does not provide all the necessary information for interpreting pronouns; constraints are also imposed by world knowledge, pragmatics, semantics and phonology..  How should the centering algorithm interact with an inferencing mechanism? Should it make choices when there is more than one proposed anchor with the same ranking? In a database query system, how should answers be incorporated into the discourse model? How does centering interact with a treatment of definite/indefinite NP's and quantifiers? We are exploring ideas for these and other extensions to the centering approach for modeling reference in local discourse..
