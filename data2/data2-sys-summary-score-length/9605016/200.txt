 The most outstanding of these benefits is probably the fact that the specific way, how the complete grammar is encoded, namely in terms of `combinatory potentials' of its words, gives us at the same time recipes for the construction of meanings, once the words have been combined with others to form larger linguistic entities..  Note that the fact, that this problematic case doesn't show up in the correct analysis of normal NL sentences, doesn't mean that a parser wouldn't have to try it, unless some arbitrary bound to that number is assumed..  These ingredient systems are obtained by varying the Lambek calculus along two dimensions: adding the permutation rule (P) and/or dropping the assumption that the type combinator (which forms the sequences the systems talk about) is associative (N for non-associative .  Furthermore, due to the Subformula Property we know that in a cut-free proof of , the main formula in abstractions (right rules) may only be either or , where , since all other implication types have primitive antecedents..  We consider each direction in turn..
