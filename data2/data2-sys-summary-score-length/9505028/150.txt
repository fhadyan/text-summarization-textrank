 A SIC is a finite set of elementary node addresses (ENAs .  In the case of the to adore tree, the situation is the inverse: the functional subject requires a finite verb to agree with, which is signaled by the fact that its component's root and frontier nodes are labelled S and VP, respectively, but the verb itself is not finite and therefore only projects to VP fin .  In many frameworks, complementation and modification are in fact made explicit: LFG provides a separate functional (f structure, and dependency grammars (see e.g..  While this might provide a satisfactory treatment of modification at the derivation level, there are now three types of operations (two adjunctions and substitution) for two types of dependencies (arguments and modifiers and the directionality problem for embedded clauses remains unsolved..
