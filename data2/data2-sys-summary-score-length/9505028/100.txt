 In the case of the to adore tree, the situation is the inverse: the functional subject requires a finite verb to agree with, which is signaled by the fact that its component's root and frontier nodes are labelled S and VP, respectively, but the verb itself is not finite and therefore only projects to VP fin .  In many frameworks, complementation and modification are in fact made explicit: LFG provides a separate functional (f structure, and dependency grammars (see e.g..
