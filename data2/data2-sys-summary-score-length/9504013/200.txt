 What principles govern the creation of good examples, and how can a system generate examples that not only communicate the target information, but also are consistent with the user's general world knowledge? Knowledge acquisition: This is not really an `NLG' topic, but it is very important to the success of NLG systems, which usually are knowledge intensive..  In other words, if a text-generation system has to be able to generate texts that are appropriate for many different kinds of situations, it may be difficult to use as well as build; and there may be a strong argument for building a system which uses knowledge-based techniques to represent the desired content of the output, and then generates an appropriate textual presentation of this context..  The house is large..  The house is on Sullivan Street..  PLANDOC summarizes the history of an engineer using a simulation package, and generates text such as This refinement activated DLC for CSA 2111 in 1995 Q3, for CSAs 2112 and 2113 in 1995 Q4, and for CSAs 2114, 2115, and 2116 in 1996 Q1..
