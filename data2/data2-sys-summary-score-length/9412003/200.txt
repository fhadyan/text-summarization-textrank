 If the suitability of a target cluster is determined by a small number of very frequently co-occurring clusters, then increasing h could make the heuristic perform worse, because the effect of the most important clusters is perturbed by a large number of less important clusters (the heuristic only counts the number of clusters in both lists and does not weigh them .  What is a suitable function F, also called optimisation criterion? Given a classification function G, the probabilities pG(w|v) of equation can be estimated using the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, e.g..  First pG,Ti(wi|wi-1) is rewritten as usual (see equation p G,T i w|v) = p G,T i G(w G(v p G, T i w|G(w = frac{p G,T i g 1 g 2 p G,T i g 1 * frac{p G,T i g 2 w p G,T i g 2 end{eqnarray} gt; where g1=G(v) and g2=G(w .
