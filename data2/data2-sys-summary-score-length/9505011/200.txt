 In the absence of an evaluation scheme, the only way to decide if the semantic classes produced by a system are reasonable or not is by having an expert analyze them by inspection..  One of the reasons for the lack of portability is the need for domain-specific semantic features that such systems often use for lexical, syntactic, and semantic disambiguation..  For example, suppose that Class A is generated by the system and Class B is provided by an expert (as shown in Table 1 .  For every pairwise mapping found for the classes in these two clusterings, populate the YES-YES, YES-NO, and NO-YES cells of the contingency table appropriately (see Table 2 .  The results obtained by comparing these noun classes to the clusterings provided by three different experts are shown in Table 3..  It has been our experience that, as semantic clustering is a highly subjective task, evaluating a given clustering against different experts may yield numbers that vary considerably..  A prime example of the latter is WordNet which has been used to provide such semantic classes , to assist in text understanding..
