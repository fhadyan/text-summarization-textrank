 Each row shows: the type of diagnostic, the number and percentage of classes that accomplish it, and the number and percentage of noun occurrences contained by these classes in the testing sample and ) we draw some positive (a, e) and some negative conclusions (b, c, d and f a..  Since different verb senses occur in the corpus, the SRs acquired appear mixed..  To estimate the probabilities of classes, not directly from the frequencies of their noun members, but correcting this evidence by the number of senses of those nouns, e.g In this way, the estimated function would be a probability distribution, and more interesting, nouns would provide evidence on the occurrence of their hyperonyms, inversely proportional to their degree of ambiguity..  An illustration of such a learning is shown in Figure , where the system, departing from the three examples of use, and knowing that prosecutor, buyer and lawmaker are nouns belonging to the semantic class SRs have been used to express semantic constraints holding in different syntactic and functional configurations..
