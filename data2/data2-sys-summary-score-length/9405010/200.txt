 First, it no longer needs to be posited that syntactic representations disappear when integrated into the discourse model; instead, syntactic and semantic representations co-exist..  With Prst utilizing a mixed representation (called syntactic/semantic structures) and Asher utilizing Discourse Representation Theory constructs, each defines mechanisms for determining relations such as parallelism and contrast, and gives constraints on resolving VP-ellipsis and related forms within their more general frameworks..  I would like to thank Stuart Shieber, Barbara Grosz, Fernando Pereira, Mary Dalrymple, Candy Sidner, Gregory Ward, Arild Hestvik, Shalom Lappin, Christine Nakatani, Stanley Chen, Karen Lochbaum, and two anonymous reviewers for valuable discussions and comments on earlier drafts..  Evidence was given that VP-ellipsis copies syntactic representations in what was termed parallel constructions (predicting the unacceptability of the voice mismatch in example ( ) and nominalized source in example ( but copies semantic representations in non-parallel constructions (predicting the acceptability of the voice mismatch in example ( ) and the nominalized source in example ( # The decision was reversed by the FBI, and the ICC did too..
