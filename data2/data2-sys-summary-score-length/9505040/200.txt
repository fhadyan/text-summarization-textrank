 In Brill's tagger , an initial calculation in each pass computes the confusion matrix for the current tag assignments and sorts the entries of that [old-tag new-tag] matrix, so that candidate rules can then be processed in decreasing order of the maximum possible benefit for any rule changing, say, old tag I to new tag J..  (The dummy tag Z and word ZZZ indicate that the locations one to the left are beyond the sentence boundaries Rule 3 changes N to BN after a comma (which is tagged P and in Rule 4, locations tagged BN are switched to BV if the following location is tagged V and has the part-of-speech tag VB..  A rough hand categorization of a sample of the errors from a baseNP run indicates that many fall into classes that are understandably difficult for any process using only local word and part-of-speech patterns to resolve..  We would like to thank Eric Brill for making his system widely available, and Ted Briscoe and David Yarowsky for helpful comments, including the suggestion to test the system's performance without lexical rule templates..
