 In Brill's tagger , an initial calculation in each pass computes the confusion matrix for the current tag assignments and sorts the entries of that [old-tag new-tag] matrix, so that candidate rules can then be processed in decreasing order of the maximum possible benefit for any rule changing, say, old tag I to new tag J..  (The dummy tag Z and word ZZZ indicate that the locations one to the left are beyond the sentence boundaries Rule 3 changes N to BN after a comma (which is tagged P and in Rule 4, locations tagged BN are switched to BV if the following location is tagged V and has the part-of-speech tag VB..  In addition, some variations in the transformation-based learning algorithm are suggested by this application that may also be useful in other settings..
