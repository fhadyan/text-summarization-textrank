 Since neither Cf U107 nor the most accessible focus space (FS21) contains a representation of e2, the context argument will be reset until e2 is in a focus space on the focus stack..  In Fig..  In contrast to Dale Reiter dalereiter94, distinguishing descriptions are evaluated using the current utterance context as a filter, and by instantiating the discourse context successively to the Cf list of the preceding utterance, then the current focus space, then other focus spaces, until a solution is found..  When neither the Cf list nor the current focus space is the appropriate context for understanding or generating a discourse anaphoric NP, I have assumed that either an earlier focus space or a more inclusive one must be accessed..  But the object NP expresses attributes last mentioned in segment 17, thus relating U108 to the earlier focus space FS17..  I first sorted the discourse anaphoric NPs in the corpus (N=1,233) into the three categories of phrasal NPs (PhrNPs; N=563 explicit pronouns (PROs: definite, indefinite, demonstrative; N=544 and zero pronominals (ZPs; N=126 .
