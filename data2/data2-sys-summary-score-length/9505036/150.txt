 Dale dale89 generates anaphoric pronouns and phrasal NPs by distinct means..  In contrast to Dale Reiter dalereiter94, distinguishing descriptions are evaluated using the current utterance context as a filter, and by instantiating the discourse context successively to the Cf list of the preceding utterance, then the current focus space, then other focus spaces, until a solution is found..  When neither the Cf list nor the current focus space is the appropriate context for understanding or generating a discourse anaphoric NP, I have assumed that either an earlier focus space or a more inclusive one must be accessed..  I first sorted the discourse anaphoric NPs in the corpus (N=1,233) into the three categories of phrasal NPs (PhrNPs; N=563 explicit pronouns (PROs: definite, indefinite, demonstrative; N=544 and zero pronominals (ZPs; N=126 .
