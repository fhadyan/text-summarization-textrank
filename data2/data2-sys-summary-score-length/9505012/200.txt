 The following meta-rule (4) denotes an insertion of one word inside a two-word term : (4) The resulting structure is ambiguous depending on whether the leftmost word of the term is still an argument of the head noun in the variation (e.g..  sunflower seed] oil .  Due to the finite corpus, due to the finite length of terms and due to the non circularity of the definition, the incremental acquisition reaches a fixed point after a finite number of iterations..  These applications take advantage of the specific statistical behavior of words composing terms : words which are lexically related tend to be found simultaneously more frequently than they would be just by chance..  Is it realistic to suppose that lists of terms exist for technical domains ? The ever-growing mass of electronic documents calls for tools for accessing these data which have to make extensive use of term lists as sources of indexes..  In our experiment we have used the [Pascal] terminological list composed of 71,623 multi-domain terms without conceptual links, provided by the documentation center INIST/CNRS..  They both denote a surgical act..
