 But this might introduce unpleasant dependencies of the probabilities of feature structures on the order in which the stochastic procedure chooses to expand nodes, because the normalisation is carried out before we have full knowledge of the equivalence classes with which the current node might become associated..  We plan to follow up the current work by training and testing a suitable instantiation of our framework against manually annotated corpora..  It is going to turn out that an exactly analogous system of accessibility relations is present in the probabilistic type hierarchies which we define later..
