 But this might introduce unpleasant dependencies of the probabilities of feature structures on the order in which the stochastic procedure chooses to expand nodes, because the normalisation is carried out before we have full knowledge of the equivalence classes with which the current node might become associated..  We plan to follow up the current work by training and testing a suitable instantiation of our framework against manually annotated corpora..  A PCFG is a four-tuple [ W, N, N1, R ] , where W is a set of terminal symbols , N is a set of non-terminal symbols , N1 is the starting symbol and R is a set of rules of the form , where is a string of terminals and non-terminals..  On the basis of the usefulness of probabilistic context-free grammars , ch..  The inheritance information tells us that a sign is a forced choice between a sentence and a phrase, that a phrase is a forced choice between a noun-phrase (np) and a verb-phrase (vp) and that number values (num) are partitioned into singular (sing) and plural (pl .
