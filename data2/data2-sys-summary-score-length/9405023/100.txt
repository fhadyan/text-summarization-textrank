 Shifting an input symbol from an inactive state is equivalent to skipping the words of the input that were encountered after the parser reached the inactive state and prior to the current word that is being shifted..  The GLR* parser has a capability for handling common word substitutions when the parser's input string is the output of a speech recognition system..  When using the full heuristics, the percentage of sentences, for which the parser returned a parse that matched or almost matched the correct parse increased from 50% to 75 .
