 Max slipped because he spilt a bucket of water..  For instance, in Hinrichs's proposal, accomplishments and achievements introduce a new reference point that is temporally ordered after the time of the event itself, ensuring that two consecutive accomplishments or achievements in a discourse are always ordered in a temporal sequence On the other hand, Lascarides and Asher take the view that temporal relations are resolved purely as a by-product of reasoning about coherence relations holding between utterances, and in doing so, argue that treating simple and complex tenses as anaphoric is unnecessary..  He had entered the room..  in arguing that the past perfect should not be treated as anaphoric: Theories that analyse the distinction between the simple past and pluperfect purely in terms of different relations between reference times and event times, rather than in terms of event-connections, fail to explain why is acceptable but is awkward..  This constraint is imposed only to require that the second clause contain the past perfect instead of the simple past..  This work is being expanded to address issues pertaining to discourse structure and inter-segment coherence..
