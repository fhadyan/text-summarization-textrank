 Here, although universal quantifiers are used to support the extraction of properties representing the meanings of the restriction and scope (the variables R and S in the determiner lexical entries the blocking of the unwanted reading follows from the propositional structure of the glue formulas, specifically the nested linear implications..  We do this by first putting appointed in the equivalent form After universal instantiation of Z with X, this can be used to rewrite the first conjunct in the consequent of an-admirer-of-his to derive Universal instantiation of H and S together with modus ponens with the two conjuncts in the consequent as premises yield Finally, this formula can be combined with every-candidate to give the meaning of the whole sentence: In fact, this is the only derivable conclusion, showing that our analysis blocks those putative scopings in which variables occur outside the scope of their binders..  For readability, we will often uncurry as ..  Glue-language formulas are built up using linear connectives from atomic formulas of the form , whose intended interpretation is that the meaning associated with -structure S is denoted by term M of type ..
