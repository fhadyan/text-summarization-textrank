 Then the bigram estimate derived by cooccurrence smoothing is given by Notice that this formula has the same form as our similarity model ( except that it uses confusion probabilities where we use normalized weights..  Finally, while we have used our similarity model only for missing bigrams in a back-off scheme, used linear interpolation for all bigrams to combine the cooccurrence smoothing model with MLE models of bigrams and unigrams..  We thank Slava Katz for discussions on the topic of this paper, Doug McIlroy for detailed comments, Doug Paul for help with his baseline back-off model, and Andre Ljolje and Michael Riley for providing the word lattices for our experiments..  The back-off model of provides a clear separation between frequent events, for which observed frequencies are reliable probability estimators, and low-frequency events, whose prediction must involve additional information sources..  We evaluated our method by comparing its perplexity and effect on speech-recognition accuracy with the baseline bigram back-off model developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratories for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) text and dictation corpora provided by ARPA's HLT program ..
