 Finally, while we have used our similarity model only for missing bigrams in a back-off scheme, used linear interpolation for all bigrams to combine the cooccurrence smoothing model with MLE models of bigrams and unigrams..  We thank Slava Katz for discussions on the topic of this paper, Doug McIlroy for detailed comments, Doug Paul for help with his baseline back-off model, and Andre Ljolje and Michael Riley for providing the word lattices for our experiments..  The similarity model was correct in 64 cases, and the back-off model in 32..
