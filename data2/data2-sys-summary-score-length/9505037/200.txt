 The English corpus consists of the Brown Corpus, texts from the Wall Street Journal, Grolier's Electronic Encyclopedia and scientific abstracts from different fields..  Co-occurrence studies like that conducted by Wettler Rapp (1993) have shown that for many purposes it is desirable to reduce the influence of word frequency on the co-occurrence counts..  This similarity measure leads to a value of zero for identical matrices, and to a value of 20 000 in the case that a non-zero entry in one of the 100 * 100 matrices always corresponds to a zero-value in the other..  best discriminating characteristic..  Ambiguities in word translations can be taken into account by working with continuous probabilities to judge whether a word translation is correct instead of making a binary decision..  Thereby, different sizes of the two matrices could be allowed for..  However, despite serious efforts in the compilation of corpora (Church Mercer, 1993; Armstrong Thompson, 1995) the availability of a large enough parallel corpus in a specific field and for a given pair of languages will always be the exception, not the rule..
