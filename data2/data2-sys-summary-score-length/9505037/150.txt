 This similarity measure leads to a value of zero for identical matrices, and to a value of 20 000 in the case that a non-zero entry in one of the 100 * 100 matrices always corresponds to a zero-value in the other..  An algorithm currently under construction therefore searches for many local minima, and tries to find out what word correspondences are the most reliable ones..  Ambiguities in word translations can be taken into account by working with continuous probabilities to judge whether a word translation is correct instead of making a binary decision..  However, despite serious efforts in the compilation of corpora (Church Mercer, 1993; Armstrong Thompson, 1995) the availability of a large enough parallel corpus in a specific field and for a given pair of languages will always be the exception, not the rule..
