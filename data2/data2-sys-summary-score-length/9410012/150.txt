 The step forward taken in the work here is to show that there are three patterns of re-estimation behaviour, with differing guidelines for how to use BW effectively, and that to obtain a good starting point when a hand-tagged corpus is not available or is too small, either the lexicon or the transitions must be biased..  In the end it may turn out there is simply no way of making the prediction without a source of information extrinsic to both model and corpus..  (1990 .  The model is defined by two collections of parameters: the transition probabilities, which express the probability that a tag follows the preceding one (or two for a second order model and the lexical probabilities, giving the probability that a word has a given tag without regard to words on either side of it..
