 It seems likely that what is going on is that the model is converging to towards something of similar quality in each case, but when the pattern is classical, the convergence starts from a lower quality model and improves, and in the other cases, it starts from a higher quality one and deteriorates..  The step forward taken in the work here is to show that there are three patterns of re-estimation behaviour, with differing guidelines for how to use BW effectively, and that to obtain a good starting point when a hand-tagged corpus is not available or is too small, either the lexicon or the transitions must be biased..  (1990 .  The model is defined by two collections of parameters: the transition probabilities, which express the probability that a tag follows the preceding one (or two for a second order model and the lexical probabilities, giving the probability that a word has a given tag without regard to words on either side of it..  During the first experiment, it became apparent that Baum-Welch re-estimation sometimes decreases the accuracy as the iteration progresses..
