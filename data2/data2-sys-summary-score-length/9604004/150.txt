 Briscoe Carroll (1993) describe a probablistic parser using a wide-coverage unification-based grammar of English written in the Alvey Natural Language Tools (ANLT) metagrammatical formalism (Briscoe et al 1987 generating around 800 rules in a syntactic variant of the Definite Clause Grammar formalism (DCG, Pereira Warren, 1980) extended with iterative (Kleene) operators..  Integrating the text and the PoS sequence grammars is straightforward and the result remains modular, in that the text grammar is `folded into' the PoS sequence grammar, by treating text and syntactic categories as overlapping and dealing with the properties of each using disjoint sets of features, principles of feature propagation, and so forth..  The probabilistic model is a refinement of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) conditioning CF `backbone' rule application on LR state and lookahead item..
