 The training and test data were both the unprocessed, original data sets..  A maximum likelihood method would use the training data to give the following estimation for the conditional probability: Unfortunately sparse data problems make this estimate useless..  It is defined recursively as follows: If f(w1,w2 wn-1 c1 Else if f(w2,w3 wn-1 c2 Else if f(w3,w4 wn-1 c3 Else backing-off continues in the same way..  There is no such sequence in the PP-attachment problem, and because of this there are four possible triples when backing off from quadruples v,n1,p (v,p,n2 (n1,p,n2) and (v,n1,n2 and six possible pairs when backing off from triples v,p (n1,p (p,n2 (v,n1 (v,n2) and (n1,n2 .  In an effort to reduce sparse data problems the following processing was run over both test and training data: All 4-digit numbers were replaced with the string `YEAR .
