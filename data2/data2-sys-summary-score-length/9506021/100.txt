 A maximum likelihood method would use the training data to give the following estimation for the conditional probability: Unfortunately sparse data problems make this estimate useless..  It is defined recursively as follows: If f(w1,w2 wn-1 c1 Else if f(w2,w3 wn-1 c2 Else if f(w3,w4 wn-1 c3 Else backing-off continues in the same way..  In an effort to reduce sparse data problems the following processing was run over both test and training data: All 4-digit numbers were replaced with the string `YEAR .
