 See figure ..  We showed that warrants are useful when the task requires agreement on the warrant, when the warrant is not currently salient, when retrieval of the warrant is indeterminate, or when retrieval has some associated cost, and that warrants hinder performance if communication is costly and if the warrant can displace information that is needed to complete the task, e.g..  Elsewhere we show that (1) some IRU strategies are only beneficial when inferential complexity is higher than in the Standard Task , ; (2) IRUs that make inferences explicit can help inference limited agents perform as well as logically omniscient ones ..  Future work should extend these results, showing that a `cooperative strategy' need not always be `cooperative and investigate additional factors that determine when strategies are effective..  For example, 1-1 is a WARRANT for the proposal in 1-2: The names of agents who use the Explicit-Warrant strategy are a numbered version of the string IEI to help the experimenter keep track of the simulation data files; IEI stands for Implicit acceptance, Explicit warrant, Implicit opening and closing..
