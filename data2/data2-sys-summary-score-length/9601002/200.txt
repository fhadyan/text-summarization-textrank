 The reduce rule that takes account of the interaction of a generic rule with a context-free grammar is The interaction with the generic rule is expressed in the term ..  That makes impossible to pre-attach an effective partial rule to each context-free rule at compilation time, such that the binding process could be performed off-line..  Though this behaviour introduces and additional complexity factor in generic rule parsing, it allows the specification of semantic and syntactic processes as independent mechanisms that interact modularly..  The reduce rule that takes account of syntactic parsing with a generic rule can be described as follows: The expression , with both arguments repeated, may seem confusing..  This reformulation is intended to a) keep the binary rules arrangement to allow easy formulation of the generic rule, and b) take into account the asymmetry between the formation process for the right and the left coordinated conjuncts ..  We need two partial rules to establish both type specifications..  On one side, it provides a declarative and modular way to reduce the search space of parsing processes without altering parsing algorithms with heuristic recipes..
