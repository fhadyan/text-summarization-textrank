 The reduce rule that takes account of the interaction of a generic rule with a context-free grammar is The interaction with the generic rule is expressed in the term ..  Though this behaviour introduces and additional complexity factor in generic rule parsing, it allows the specification of semantic and syntactic processes as independent mechanisms that interact modularly..  The reduce rule that takes account of syntactic parsing with a generic rule can be described as follows: The expression , with both arguments repeated, may seem confusing..  In this case the conjunction scheme type would substitute a sequence product by the variable x..  This reformulation is intended to a) keep the binary rules arrangement to allow easy formulation of the generic rule, and b) take into account the asymmetry between the formation process for the right and the left coordinated conjuncts ..
