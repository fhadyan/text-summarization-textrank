There are two current methods for implementing two-level rules (both implemented in SemHe (1) compiling rules into finite-state automata (multi-tape transducers in our case and (2) interpreting rules directly..  The past decade has seen a number of proposals for handling non-linear morphology; however, none (apart from Beesley's work) seem to have been implemented over large descriptions, nor have they provided means by which the grammarian can develop non-linear descriptions using higher level notation..  (SemHe makes use of an earlier implementation by In order to minimise accumulator-passing arguments, we assume the following initially-empty stacks: ParseStack accumulates the category structures of the morphemes identified, and FeatureStack maintains the rule features encountered so far..
