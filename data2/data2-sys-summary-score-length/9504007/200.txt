 Many researchers have noted that the absence of mixed-initiative gives rise to two problems with expert systems: They don't allow users to participate in the reasoning process, or to ask the questions they want answered , , ..  These principles indirectly provide a means to ensure mutual belief..  Thus this work highlights aspects of collaboration in discourse, but should be formally integrated with research on collaborative planning , , particularly with respect to the relation between control shifts and the coordination of plans..
