 If parsing is taken to be the first step in taming the natural language understanding task, then broad coverage NLP remains a jungle inhabited by wild beasts..  For instance, parsing noun compounds appears to require detailed world knowledge that is unavailable outside a limited domain (Sparck Jones, 1983 .  Conceptual association outperforms lexical association, presumably because of its ability to generalise..  In all experiments the dependency model provides a substantial advantage over the adjacency model, even though the latter is more prevalent in proposals within the literature..  The model also has the further commendation that it predicts correctly the observed proportion of left-branching compounds found in two independently extracted test sets..  Given the high frequency of occurrence of noun compounds in many texts, this suggests that the use of these techniques in probabilistic parsers will result in higher performance in broad coverage natural language processing..  The task is illustrated in example : (a) [woman [aid worker (b) hydrogen ion ] exchange ] The parses assigned to these two compounds differ, even though the sequence of parts of speech are identical..
