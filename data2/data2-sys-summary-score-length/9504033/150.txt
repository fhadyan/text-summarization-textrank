 If parsing is taken to be the first step in taming the natural language understanding task, then broad coverage NLP remains a jungle inhabited by wild beasts..  Figure shows the resulting accuracy, with accuracy values from figure displayed with dotted lines..  The model also has the further commendation that it predicts correctly the observed proportion of left-branching compounds found in two independently extracted test sets..  Given the high frequency of occurrence of noun compounds in many texts, this suggests that the use of these techniques in probabilistic parsers will result in higher performance in broad coverage natural language processing..  The task is illustrated in example : (a) [woman [aid worker (b) hydrogen ion ] exchange ] The parses assigned to these two compounds differ, even though the sequence of parts of speech are identical..
