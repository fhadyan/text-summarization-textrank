 Caswey et al..  Smith is teaching AI next semester..  Our model 1) detects conflicts in beliefs and initiates a negotiation subdialogue only when the conflict is relevant to the current task, 2) selects the most effective aspect to address in its pursuit of conflict resolution when multiple conflicts exist, 3) selects appropriate evidence to justify the system's proposed modification of the user's beliefs, and 4) captures the negotiation process in a recursive Propose-Evaluate-Modify cycle of actions, thus enabling the system to handle embedded negotiation subdialogues..
