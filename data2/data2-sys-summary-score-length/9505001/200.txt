 Caswey et al..  Smith is teaching AI next semester..  Our model 1) detects conflicts in beliefs and initiates a negotiation subdialogue only when the conflict is relevant to the current task, 2) selects the most effective aspect to address in its pursuit of conflict resolution when multiple conflicts exist, 3) selects appropriate evidence to justify the system's proposed modification of the user's beliefs, and 4) captures the negotiation process in a recursive Propose-Evaluate-Modify cycle of actions, thus enabling the system to handle embedded negotiation subdialogues..  Given an unaccepted belief bel) and the beliefs proposed to support it, Select-Focus-Modification will annotate _bel with 1) its focus of modification bel.focus which contains a set of beliefs bel and/or its descendents) which, if disbelieved by the user, are predicted to cause him to disbelieve _bel, and 2) the system's evidence against _bel itself bel.s-attack .  In this recursive process, the algorithm annotates each unaccepted belief or evidential relationship proposed to support _bel with its focus of modification beli.focus) and the system's evidence against it beli.s-attack .
