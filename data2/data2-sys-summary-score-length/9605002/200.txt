 Mrs Black has a high temperature..  One of the simplest (and most common) approaches is simply to write a `hard-coded' content/text-planner in a standard programming language (C Lisp, etc .  If it doesn't matter if the text sounds stilted and was obviously produced by a computer, then it may be possible to de-emphasize sentence planning, and perform minimal aggregation, use no pronouns, etc..  Agreement..  Reflexives..  In particular, if only a few different types of sentences are being generated, then it may be simpler and cheaper to use fill-in-the-blank templates for realization, instead of `proper' syntactic processing..  A good NLG engineer will choose the most appropriate set of techniques, given the needs of the application and the available resources..  Such languages typically allow the developer to represent text plans as transition networks of one sort or another, with the nodes giving the information content and the arcs giving the rhetorical structure In many cases text-planning languages are implemented as macro packages, which gives the developer access to the full power of the underlying programming language whenever necessary..
