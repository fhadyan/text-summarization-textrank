 Datalog grammars were born in order to address all these deficiencies, namely: an infinite Herbrand Universe, non-termination, unnecessary recomputation, structure creation on the heap, bottleneck for multi-threaded execution due to the use of (sequential) list data structures, and inability to work directly on files..  requantification..  In Datalog grammars, a given CF grammar is automatically translated into an assertional representation, first proposed by Robert Kowalski, which is largely equivalent to the list-based one but which ensures, under appropriate evaluation mechanisms such as OLDT resolution, that the termination and complexity properties of the original CF-grammar are preserved..  Another interesting observation is that the results in concerning the use of the distinction between primary and secondary occurrences of parallel elements in order to provide ambiguous readings of discourses such as Jessie likes her brother..
