 This research was supported by NSERC Research grants 31-611024 and OGP0107411, and by NSERC, CSS and SFU PRG Infrastructure and Equipment grant given to the Logic and Functional Programming Laboratory at SFU, in whose facilities part of this work was developed..  Datalog grammars were born in order to address all these deficiencies, namely: an infinite Herbrand Universe, non-termination, unnecessary recomputation, structure creation on the heap, bottleneck for multi-threaded execution due to the use of (sequential) list data structures, and inability to work directly on files..
