 The key virtue of descriptive complexity results like the characterizations of language-theoretic complexity classes discussed here and the more typical characterizations of computational complexity classes , is that they allow us to determine the complexity of checking properties independently of how that checking is implemented..  Moreover, since these classifications are based on structural properties and the structural properties of natural language can be studied more or less directly, there is a reasonable expectation of finding empirical evidence falsifying a hypothesis about language-theoretic complexity of natural languages if such evidence exists..  Note that is symmetric..
