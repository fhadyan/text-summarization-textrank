 The key virtue of descriptive complexity results like the characterizations of language-theoretic complexity classes discussed here and the more typical characterizations of computational complexity classes , is that they allow us to determine the complexity of checking properties independently of how that checking is implemented..  While the linguistic significance of individual results of this sort is open to debate, they at least loosely parallel typical linguistic concerns: closure properties state regularities that are exhibited by the languages in a class, normal forms express generalizations about their structure..  Moreover, since these classifications are based on structural properties and the structural properties of natural language can be studied more or less directly, there is a reasonable expectation of finding empirical evidence falsifying a hypothesis about language-theoretic complexity of natural languages if such evidence exists..  We look briefly at two of these issues..
