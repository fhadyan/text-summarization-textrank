 The belief reasoning mechanism of Design-World agents was informed by the theory of belief revision and the multi-agent simulation environment developed in the Automated Librarian project , ..  Elsewhere we show that: (1) when retrieval is free or when communication cost is high, that the Explicit-Warrant strategy is detrimental at low AWM ; (2) some IRU strategies are only beneficial when inferential complexity is higher than in the Standard Task (3) IRUs that make inferences explicit can help inference limited agents perform as well as logically omniscient ones ..
