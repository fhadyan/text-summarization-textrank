 At AWM parameter settings of 16, where agents can search a huge belief space for beliefs to be used as warrants, the saving in processing time is substantial..  Because the communicative strategies that we tested were based on a corpus analysis of human human financial advice dialogues and because variations in the Design-World task were parametrized, we believe the results presented here may be domain independent, though clearly more research is needed..  Elsewhere we show that: (1) when retrieval is free or when communication cost is high, that the Explicit-Warrant strategy is detrimental at low AWM ; (2) some IRU strategies are only beneficial when inferential complexity is higher than in the Standard Task (3) IRUs that make inferences explicit can help inference limited agents perform as well as logically omniscient ones ..
