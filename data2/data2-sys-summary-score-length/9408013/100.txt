 Linear scaling always gives this function a negative weight, causing temporal modifications to be downgraded, and in fact the relativised training score of a QLF turns out to be negatively correlated with the number of temporal modifiers it contains..  In order to make these trees compatible with the treebank and also to make them relatively insensitive to minor changes in semantic analysis, these QLF-induced trees simply consist of nested constituents with two categories, A (argument) and P (predication corresponding to constituents induced by QLF term and form expressions respectively..
