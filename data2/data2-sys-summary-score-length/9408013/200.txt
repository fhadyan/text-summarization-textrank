 Linear scaling always gives this function a negative weight, causing temporal modifications to be downgraded, and in fact the relativised training score of a QLF turns out to be negatively correlated with the number of temporal modifiers it contains..  Until recently, the choice of the various functions used in rule based systems was made mainly according to anecdotal information about the effectiveness of, for example, various attachment preference strategies..  In order to make these trees compatible with the treebank and also to make them relatively insensitive to minor changes in semantic analysis, these QLF-induced trees simply consist of nested constituents with two categories, A (argument) and P (predication corresponding to constituents induced by QLF term and form expressions respectively..  We vary the values of cj to minimize the sum, over all QLFs for all training sentences, of the squares of the errors in the approximation, Defining the error function as a sum of squares of differences in this way means that the minimum error is attained when the derivative with respect to each ck, , is zero..
