 The transfer rule discriminants make transfer rules act more or less strongly as defaults..  Since many aspects of language (for instance, agreement and question-formation in French) appear to be regular and readily describable by rules, it seems more logical to use a mixture of rules and statistics; it is in this sense that we have a hybrid transfer model (cf..  d(R) is then defined as This formula is a symmetric, logarithmic transform of the function (g + 1 g + b + 2 which is the expected a posteriori probability that a new (S, T1, T2) 3-tuple will be a good occurrence of R, assuming that, prior to the quantities g and b being known, this probability has a uniform a priori distribution on the interval [0,1 .
