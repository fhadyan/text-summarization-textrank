 We estimate that if referentiality could be determined 100% correctly then the percentage of noun phrases with correctly generated articles and number could be improved to 96% in the test set we studied..  Incorporating this method into the machine translation system ALT-J/E helped to improve the percentage of noun phrases with correctly generated articles and number from 65% to 73 .  As it is not always possible to explicitly determine this when translating from Japanese to English, we divide these nouns into two groups: `strongly countable those that are more often used to refer to discrete entities, such as cake, and `weakly countable those that are more often used to refer to unbounded referents, such as beer..  The number of the noun phrase is then determined by the countability preference of the noun phrase heading it..
