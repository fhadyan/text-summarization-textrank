 Although in general the performance of the cascading guesser was detected to be only 6% worse than a general-language lexicon lookup, one of the over-simplifications assumed at the extraction of the morphological rules was that they obey only simple concatenative regularities: book book+ed; take take+n; play play+ing..  For example: [booked (JJ VBD VBN [book (NN VB A[s [ed (NN VB) (JJ VBD VBN) [advisable (JJ VBD VBN [advise (NN VB A[s [able (NN VB) (JJ VBD VBN) e The operator is applied to all possible lexicon-entry pairs and if a rule produced by such an application has already been extracted from another pair, its frequency count (f) is incremented..
