 For instance, consonant doubling is naturally captured by the affixes themselves and obey simple concatenations, as, for example, describes the suffix rule A[s [ S= ging I= (NN VB) R= (JJ NN VBG) M rule, for example, will work for word pairs like tag - tagging or dig - digging..  The simplicity of the proposed shallow morphology, however, ensures fully automatic acquisition of such rules and the empirical evaluation presented in section confirmed that they are just right for the task: precision and recall of such rules were measured in the range of 96-99 .  For example: [booked (JJ VBD VBN [book (NN VB A[s [ed (NN VB) (JJ VBD VBN) [advisable (JJ VBD VBN [advise (NN VB A[s [able (NN VB) (JJ VBD VBN) e The operator is applied to all possible lexicon-entry pairs and if a rule produced by such an application has already been extracted from another pair, its frequency count (f) is incremented..
