 The following approaches towards the undecidability problem can be taken: limit the power of the FSA limit the power of the DCG compromise completeness compromise soundness These approaches are discussed now in turn..  For the sentence `a a b b' we obtain the parse forest grammar: The reader easily verifies that indeed this grammar generates (a isomorphism of) the single parse tree of this example, assuming of course that the start symbol for this parse-forest grammar is p(s,0,4 .  Thus the following FSA, defining the regular language L aa b i.e..  DCGs are represented using the same notation we used for context-free grammars, but now of course the category symbols can be first-order terms of arbitrary complexity (note that without loss of generality we don't take into account DCGs having external actions defined in curly braces .
