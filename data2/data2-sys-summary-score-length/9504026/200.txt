 The following approaches towards the undecidability problem can be taken: limit the power of the FSA limit the power of the DCG compromise completeness compromise soundness These approaches are discussed now in turn..  Of course it is possible to experiment with different ways of taking the context-free skeleton (including as much information as possible / useful .  For the sentence `a a b b' we obtain the parse forest grammar: The reader easily verifies that indeed this grammar generates (a isomorphism of) the single parse tree of this example, assuming of course that the start symbol for this parse-forest grammar is p(s,0,4 .  DCGs are represented using the same notation we used for context-free grammars, but now of course the category symbols can be first-order terms of arbitrary complexity (note that without loss of generality we don't take into account DCGs having external actions defined in curly braces .  Furthermore, let and ..  figure ..  For each (k the length of lists A and B) define a DCG rule (the i-th member of A is , and the i-th member of B is 2..
