 The following approaches towards the undecidability problem can be taken: limit the power of the FSA limit the power of the DCG compromise completeness compromise soundness These approaches are discussed now in turn..  Cycles might emerge to treat unknown sequences of words, i.e..  For the sentence `a a b b' we obtain the parse forest grammar: The reader easily verifies that indeed this grammar generates (a isomorphism of) the single parse tree of this example, assuming of course that the start symbol for this parse-forest grammar is p(s,0,4 .
