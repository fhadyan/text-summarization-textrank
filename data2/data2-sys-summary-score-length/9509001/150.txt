 More simplistic systems will inevitably assign one choice to two different inputs because their linguistic knowledge fails to support a distinction..  Let An obvious question is why systems such as Lauer (1994) and Resnik and Hearst (1993) work at all given that far less than one instance is expected for each slot..  First, the mathematical model doesn't capture several aspects of existing models, such as maximising probabilities over sequences of words and combining evidence from multiple sources..  Putting these components together, we can define a Statistical Processor, S as a tuple , where: is the set of all possible linguistic events B and V are finite sets, the bins and values respectively A is the trained analysis function Amongst all such statistical processors, there is a special class in which we are interested..
