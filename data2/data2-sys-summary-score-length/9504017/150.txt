 Mercer mercerphd formalizes presuppositions in a logical framework that handles defaults , but this approach is not tractable and it treats natural disjunction as an exclusive-or and implication as logical equivalence..  We propose a new formalism, called stratified logic that correctly handles the pragmatic inferences, and we start by giving a very brief introduction to the main ideas that underlie it..  The lattice depicts the three levels of strength that seem to account for the inferences that pertain to natural language semantics and pragmatics: indefeasible information belongs to the u layer, infelicitously defeasible information belongs to the i layer, and felicitously defeasible information belongs to the dlayer..  We can taxonomize previous approaches to defeasible pragmatic inferences into three categories (we omit here work on defeasibility related to linguistic phenomena such as discourse, anaphora, or speech acts .
