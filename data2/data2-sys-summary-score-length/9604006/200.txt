 In subsequent work we took a step back and asked: what do people actually do when they construct referring expressions? It is very difficult to make any strong claims on the basis of the experiments that have been done, but it does seem to be the case that people do not build minimal distinguishing descriptions in the strong sense suggested above..  Another possibility perhaps a little tenuous in the current example, but clearly a possibility nonetheless is that the hearer may be red-green colour blind, and the speaker is imparting additional information about the colour of the pen which the hearer may be able to make use of later..  Certainly, in principle one could construct a generation system that `lied' for purposes such as advertising or manipulation, or that produced descriptions that were `correct' relative to the hearer's knowledge even if they were untrue in the world; for example, we might want to build a system which could generate the man drinking a martini to refer to a man who was actually drinking water from a martini glass..
