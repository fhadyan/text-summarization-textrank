 We assign the following lexical entry to the verb seek: The significant fact here is that seek differs from an extensional verb such as find below (corresponding to the type ) in its specification of requirements on its object: Note also the use of the operators and of IL..  The lexical entry for seek can be paraphrased as follows: Rather than looking for an entity type meaning for its object, the requirement expressed by the subformula labeled exactly describes the form of quantified NP meanings discussed in the previous section..  The meaning constructor for seek also allows for nonquantified objects as arguments, without needing a special type-raising rule..  Formally, from Al we can prove (Figure This corresponds to the Montagovian type-raising of a proper name meaning to an NP meaning, and also to the undirected Lambek calculus derivation of the sequent ..  Thus The derivation in Figure can be generalized as shown in Figure to produce the general type-raising theorem: This theorem can be used to raise meanings of e type to type, or, dually, to quantify into verb argument positions..
