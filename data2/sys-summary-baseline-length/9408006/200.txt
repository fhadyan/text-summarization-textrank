 This paper describes LHIP (Left-Head corner Island Parser a parser designed for broad-coverage handling of unrestricted text.  The system interprets an extended DCG formalism to produce a robust analyser that finds parses of the input made from `islands' of terminals (corresponding to terminals consumed by successful grammar rules   It is currently in use for processing dialogue transcripts from the HCRC Map Task Corpus (Anderson et al 1991 although we expect its eventual applications to be much wider.  Transcribed natural speech contains a number of frequent characteristic `ungrammatical' phenomena: filled pauses, repetitions, restarts, etc.  (as in e.g.  Right I'll have you know, like I'll have to so I'm going between the picket fence and the mill, right   While a full analysis of a conversation might well take these into account, for many purposes they represent a significant obstacle to analysis.  LHIP provides a processing method which allows selected portions of the input to be ignored or handled differently.  We expand on these points and introduce other differences below.  The coverage of R is then m.
