 Aggregation is any syntactic process that allows the expression of concise and tightly constructed text such as coordination or subordination.  By using the parallelism of syntactic structure to express similar information, writers can convey the same amount of information in a shorter space.  Coordination has been the object of considerable research (for an overview, see   In contrast to linguistic approaches, which are generally analytic, the treatment of coordination in this paper is from a synthetic point of view text generation.  It raises issues such as deciding when and how to coordinate.  An algorithm for generating coordinated sentences is implemented in PLANDoc an automated documentation system.  PLANDoc generates natural language reports based on the interaction between telephone planning engineers and LEIS-PLAN, a knowledge based system.  Input to PLANDoc is a series of messages, or semantic functional descriptions (FD, Fig.  Each FD is an atomic decision about telephone equipment installation chosen by a planning engineer.  The domain of discourse is currently limited to 31 message types, but user interactions include many variations and combinations of these messages.  In Fig.
