 I will assume in this paper that a discourse is a sequence of utterances produced (spoken or written) by one or more discourse participants.  Utterances are tokens of sentences or sentence fragments with which the speakers communicate certain information, and it is done in a context.  Utterance interpretation depends on the context, and utterance meaning updates the context.  What are the major modules of the architecture, and what types of inferences do they support? I claim that the most fundamental separation is between the spaces of possibilities and preferences.
