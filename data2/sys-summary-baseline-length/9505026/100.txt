 The experiments reported in the current article continue a line of research in the field of part-of-speech tagging using self-organizing models that was presented at the previous (9th) Scandinavian Conference on Computational Linguistics.  Then, the well-established HMM-based Xerox tagger, see , was compared with some less known taggers, namely a neural-network tagger described in and a Bayesian tagger presented in .  The Xerox tagger performs lexical generalizations by clustering words based on their distributional patterns, while the latter two utilize the morphological information present in Swedish by generalizing over word suffixes.
