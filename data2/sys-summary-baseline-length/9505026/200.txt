 The experiments reported in the current article continue a line of research in the field of part-of-speech tagging using self-organizing models that was presented at the previous (9th) Scandinavian Conference on Computational Linguistics.  Then, the well-established HMM-based Xerox tagger, see , was compared with some less known taggers, namely a neural-network tagger described in and a Bayesian tagger presented in .  The Xerox tagger performs lexical generalizations by clustering words based on their distributional patterns, while the latter two utilize the morphological information present in Swedish by generalizing over word suffixes.  This time, another HMM-based approach is compared with a novel reductionistic statistical tagger inspired by the successful Constraint Grammar system, [   The performed experiments do not only serve to evaluate the two taggers, but also shed some new light on the Teleman corpus as an evaluation domain for part-of-speech taggers compared to other, English, corpora.  The paper is organized as follows: Section discusses the Teleman corpus and the tagsets used.  Section describes the HMM-based tagger and Section the reductionistic statistical one.  For the experiments, we used two different tagsets.
