 Categorial Grammar (CG) and in particular Lambek Categorial Grammar (LCG) have their well-known benefits for the formal treatment of natural language syntax and semantics.  The most outstanding of these benefits is probably the fact that the specific way, how the complete grammar is encoded, namely in terms of `combinatory potentials' of its words, gives us at the same time recipes for the construction of meanings, once the words have been combined with others to form larger linguistic entities.  Although both frameworks are equivalent in weak generative capacity both derive exactly the context-free languages LCG is superior to CG in that it can cope in a natural way with extraction and unbounded dependency phenomena.  Figure illustrates this proof-logical behaviour.  Otherwise there would be a simpler proof without this abstraction.  We call this fragment SDLM.
