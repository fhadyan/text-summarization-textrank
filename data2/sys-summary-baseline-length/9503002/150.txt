 Defining dialects is one of the first tasks that linguists need to pursue when approaching a language.  Knowing the dialect areas helps one allocate resources in language research and has implications for language learners, publishers, broadcasters, educators, and language planners.  Unfortunately, dialect definition can be a time-consuming and ill-defined process.  The traditional approach has been to plot isoglosses, delineating regions where the same word is used for the same concept, or perhaps the same pronunciation for the same phoneme.  But isoglosses are frustrating.  The first problem, as Gaston Paris noted (apud Durand, 1889:49 is that isoglosses rarely coincide.  At best, isoglosses for different features approach each other, forming vague bundles; at worst, isoglosses may cut across each other, describing completely contradictory binary divisions of the dialect area.
