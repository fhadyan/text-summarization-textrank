 It is widely acknowledged that a full account of natural language utterances cannot be given in terms of only syntactic or semantic phenomena.  For example, Hirschberg has shown that in order to understand a scalar implicature, one must analyze the conversants' beliefs and intentions.  To recognize normal state implicatures one must consider mutual beliefs and plans .  To understand conversational implicatures associated with indirect replies one must consider discourse expectations, discourse plans, and discourse relations , .  Some presuppositions are inferrable when certain lexical constructs (factives, aspectuals, etc) or syntactic constructs (cleft and pseudo-cleft sentences) are used.  Defeasibility is a notion that is tricky to deal with, and scholars in logics and pragmatics have learned to circumvent it or live with it.  We address this issue in more detail in section .
