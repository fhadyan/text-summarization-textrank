 Content determination (deciding what information to communicate in the text) and text-planning (organizing the information into a rhetorically coherent structure) are done simultaneously in most applied NLG systems .  These tasks can be done at many different levels of sophistication.  One of the simplest (and most common) approaches is simply to write a `hard-coded' content/text-planner in a standard programming language (C Lisp, etc   The resultant system may lack flexibility, but if the texts being produced have a standardized content and structure (which is true in many technical domains then this can be the most effective way to perform these tasks.  On the other end of the sophistication spectrum, many standard AI techniques have been adopted for content determination and text planning, including rule-based systems and planning .  Systems built in this way are in principal very flexible and powerful, although in practice they have sometimes not been robust enough for real-world use.  An intermediate approach which has been quite popular is to use a special `schema' or `text-planning' language , .  Sentence planning includes Conjunction and other aggregation.
