 It is well known that Higher-Order Unification (HOU) can be used to construct the semantics of Natural Language: - henceforth, DSP - show that it allows a treatment of VP-Ellipsis which successfully captures the interaction of VPE with quantification and nominal anaphora; , use HOU to model the interpretation of focus and its interaction with focus sensitive operators, adverbial quantifiers and second occurrence expressions; shows that HOU yields a simple but precise treatment of corrections; Finally, uses linear HOU to reconstruct under-specified semantic representations.  However, it is also well known that the HOU approach to NL semantics systematically over-generates and that some general theory of the interface between the interpretation process and other sources of linguistic information is needed in order to avoid this.  section   section   We illustrate this by an example in section .  section
