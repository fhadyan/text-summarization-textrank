 As a preliminary to presenting our analysis of intensional verbs, we outline our approach to semantic interpretation in LFG.  It is well known that surface constituent structure does not always provide the optimal set of constituents or hierarchical structure to guide semantic interpretation.  This has led to efforts to develop more abstract structures for the representation of relevant syntactic information.  We follow Kaplan and Bresnan (1982) and in taking the functional structure or f-structure of LFG as the primary input to semantic interpretation.  The syntactic structures of LFG, the constituent structure or c-structure and the f-structure, are related by means of a functional correspondence, represented in Figure by solid lines leading from nodes of the c-structure tree to f-structures (   In more recent work, and have proposed to extend the theory of correspondences to other structures, called projections.  Here, we will appeal to a semantic projection , relating f-structures and their meanings.  Notationally, a subscript will indicate the semantic or projection of an f-structure f, so that the semantic projection of f will be written .
