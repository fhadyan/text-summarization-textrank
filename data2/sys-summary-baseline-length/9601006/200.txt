 Possessive pronouns are often used as determiners in English when no equivalent would be used in a Japanese sentence with the same meaning.  For example, when referring to specific family members in English, it is normal to specify whose relations they are.  In Japanese these are only specified if they are not obvious from the context.  For a machine translation system to generate appropriate English when translating from Japanese, it is necessary to determine which pronouns should be used and when.  The similar problem of determining article usage and noun phrase number has recently been approached in three ways: using expert-system-like rules to determine the referential property and number of nouns ; using heuristic rules based on the meaning of the Japanese sentence and the properties of the generated English to determine the referentiality and number of English noun phrases and using a Context Monitor to maintain contextual information dynamically .  In addition, the method uses contextual information about noun phrase referentiality, the meaning and modality of the main verb and the denotation of the subject of the sentence that the noun phrase appears in.
