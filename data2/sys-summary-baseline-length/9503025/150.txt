 Word vectors reflecting word meanings are expected to enable numerical approaches to semantics.  Some early attempts at vector representation in psycholinguistics were the semantic differential approach and the associative distribution approach .  However, they were derived manually through psychological experiments.  An early attempt at automation was made by Wilks et al.  using co-occurrence statistics.  Since then, there have been some promising results from using co-occurrence vectors, such as word sense disambiguation , and word clustering .  However, using the co-occurrence statistics requires a huge corpus that covers even most rare words.  We recently developed word vectors that are derived from an ordinary dictionary by measuring the inter-word distances in the word definitions .  This method, by its nature, has no problem handling rare words.  A reference network of the words in a dictionary (Fig.
