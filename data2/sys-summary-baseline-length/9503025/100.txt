 Word vectors reflecting word meanings are expected to enable numerical approaches to semantics.  Some early attempts at vector representation in psycholinguistics were the semantic differential approach and the associative distribution approach .  However, they were derived manually through psychological experiments.  An early attempt at automation was made by Wilks et al.  using co-occurrence statistics.  Since then, there have been some promising results from using co-occurrence vectors, such as word sense disambiguation , and word clustering .  This method, by its nature, has no problem handling rare words.
