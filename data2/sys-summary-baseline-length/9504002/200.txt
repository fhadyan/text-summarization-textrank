 Tagging by means of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is widely recognised as an effective technique for assigning parts of speech to a corpus in a robust and efficient manner.  An attractive feature of the technique is that the algorithm itself is independent of the (natural) language to which it is applied.  All of the knowledge engineering is localised in the choice of tagset and the method of training.  Typically, training makes use of a manually tagged corpus, or an untagged corpus with some initial bootstrapping probabilities.  Some attention has been given to how to make such techniques effective; for example Cutting et al.  (1992) suggest ways of training trigram taggers, and Merialdo (1994) and Elworthy (1994) consider the amount and quality of the seeding data needed to construct an accurate tagger.  In training a tagger for a given language, a major part of the knowledge engineering required can therefore be localised in the choice of the tagset.  The design of an appropriate tagset is subject to both external and internal criteria.
