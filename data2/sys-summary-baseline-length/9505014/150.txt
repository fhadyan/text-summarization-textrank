 This work is concerned with the problems of adding the concept of presupposition to a logical language.  Although presupposition originates as a natural language phenomenon, for the purposes of the present work sentences will be represented as propositions of a logical language.  At this level of granularity, presupposition can simply be represented as a relation between sentences.  For instance, the sentence The typewriter is working can be said to presuppose: There is a typewriter.  Presupposition has the additional property (often used to characterize it) that the negation of a sentence has the same presuppositions as the sentence itself.  For example, the sentence The typewriter is not working has the same presupposition as its positive counterpart given above (namely, that there is a typewriter   It is considered a desired property for any formal language.
