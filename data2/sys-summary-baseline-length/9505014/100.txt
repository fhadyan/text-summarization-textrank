 This work is concerned with the problems of adding the concept of presupposition to a logical language.  Although presupposition originates as a natural language phenomenon, for the purposes of the present work sentences will be represented as propositions of a logical language.  At this level of granularity, presupposition can simply be represented as a relation between sentences.  For instance, the sentence The typewriter is working can be said to presuppose: There is a typewriter.  It is considered a desired property for any formal language.  This solution is essentially linguistic.
