 Parallel and distributed computation is expected to be the main stream of information processing.  In the conventional generation, the rules for composition are given from the outside and those rules control all the behavior of the symbols or the objects, for assembling a hierarchical tree structure.  For example, all the linguistic objects, such as words and phrases must be applied to so-called grammar rules to form grammatical structures or rational semantic representations, under a strict controller process.  However, this kind of formalization obviously contradicts the partial / distributed processing that would be required in parallel architecture in future.  In order to represent grammar rules distributively, we adopt categorial grammar, where we can an attach local grammar rule to each word and phrase.  What we aim in this paper is to propose a paradigm that enables partial / local generation through decompositions and reorganizations of tentative local structures.  In the following section, we introduce the extended lambda-calculus.  Thereafter we introduce the ChAM model and we reinterpret the model in terms of natural language processings.  We use greek letters, for type schemas.
