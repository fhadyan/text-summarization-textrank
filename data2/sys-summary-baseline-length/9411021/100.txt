 Parallel and distributed computation is expected to be the main stream of information processing.

For example, all the linguistic objects, such as words and phrases must be applied to so-called grammar rules to form grammatical structures or rational semantic representations, under a strict controller process.  In the following section, we introduce the extended lambda-calculus.
