 Prepositional phrase attachment is a common cause of structural ambiguity in natural language.  For example take the following sentence: Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, joined the board as a nonexecutive director.  The PP `as a nonexecutive director' can either attach to the NP `the board' or to the VP `joined giving two alternative structures.  (In this case the VP attachment is correct NP-attach: (joined the board) (as a nonexecutive director VP-attach: joined (the board (as a nonexecutive director Work by Ratnaparkhi, Reynar and Roukos and Brill and Resnik has considered corpus-based approaches to this problem, using a set of examples to train a model which is then used to make attachment decisions on test data.  Both papers describe methods which look at the four head words involved in the attachment - the VP head, the first NP head, the preposition and the second NP head (in this case joined, board, as and director respectively   This paper proposes a new statistical method for PP-attachment disambiguation based on the four head words.
