 Prepositional phrase attachment is a common cause of structural ambiguity in natural language.  For example take the following sentence: Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, joined the board as a nonexecutive director.  The PP `as a nonexecutive director' can either attach to the NP `the board' or to the VP `joined giving two alternative structures.  (In this case the VP attachment is correct NP-attach: (joined the board) (as a nonexecutive director VP-attach: joined (the board (as a nonexecutive director Work by Ratnaparkhi, Reynar and Roukos and Brill and Resnik has considered corpus-based approaches to this problem, using a set of examples to train a model which is then used to make attachment decisions on test data.  The data consisted of training and test files of 20801 and 3097 quintuples respectively.
