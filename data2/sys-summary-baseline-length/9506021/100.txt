 Prepositional phrase attachment is a common cause of structural ambiguity in natural language.  For example take the following sentence: Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, joined the board as a nonexecutive director.  The PP `as a nonexecutive director' can either attach to the NP `the board' or to the VP `joined giving two alternative structures.  This paper proposes a new statistical method for PP-attachment disambiguation based on the four head words.  The training and test data were supplied by IBM, being identical to that used in .
