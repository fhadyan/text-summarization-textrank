 Compositionality is defined as the property that the meaning of a whole is a function of the meaning of its parts (cf.  , pp.24-25   (A slightly less general definition, e.g.  , postulates the existence of a homomorphism from syntax to semantics   However, we can prove a theorem stating that any semantics can be encoded as a compositional semantics, which means that, essentially, the standard definition of compositionality is formally vacuous.  Thus, although intuitively clear, the definition is not restrictive enough.  THEOREM 1.  a function.
