 Compositionality is defined as the property that the meaning of a whole is a function of the meaning of its parts (cf.  , pp.24-25   (A slightly less general definition, e.g.  , postulates the existence of a homomorphism from syntax to semantics   However, we can prove a theorem stating that any semantics can be encoded as a compositional semantics, which means that, essentially, the standard definition of compositionality is formally vacuous.  Thus, although intuitively clear, the definition is not restrictive enough.  We illustrate the power of the theorem by showing how to assign compositional semantics to idioms and to a very counterintuitive semantics of coordination (Section 4   Given a class of functions F, we say that the compositional semantics is systematic if the meaning function belongs to the class F.  We show that when compositional semantics is required to be systematic we can distinguish between grammars with compositional and non-compositional semantics; we present an example of a simple grammar for which there is no "systematic" compositional semantics (Section 3   a language, can have some compositional semantics.  Proof.
