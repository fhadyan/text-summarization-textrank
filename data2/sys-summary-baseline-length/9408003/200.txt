 Describing objects is one of several purposes for which linguists use feature structures.  A description is an entity that can be interpreted as true or false of an object.  For example, the conventional interpretation of the description `it is black' is true of a soot particle, but false of a snowflake.  Therefore, any use of a feature structure to describe an object demands that the feature structure can be interpreted as true or false of the object.  In this paper, I tailor the semantics of [ ] to suit the typed feature structures of [ and so create an explicit interpretation of a typed feature structure used as a description.  I then use this interpretation to define the notion of a satisfiable feature structure.  Though no feature structure algebra provides descriptions as expressive as those provided by a feature logic, using feature structures to describe objects profits from a large stock of available computational techniques to represent, test and process feature structures.  A signature provides the symbols from which to construct typed feature structures, and an interpretation gives those symbols meaning.
