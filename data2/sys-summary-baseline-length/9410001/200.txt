 In speech recognition and understanding systems, many kinds of language model may be used to choose between the word and sentence hypotheses for which there is evidence in the acoustic data.  Some words, word sequences, syntactic constructions and semantic structures are more likely to occur than others, and the presence of more likely objects in a sentence hypothesis is evidence for the correctness of that hypothesis.  Evidence from different knowledge sources can be combined in an attempt to optimize the selection of correct hypotheses; see e.g.  Alshawi and Carter (1994 Rayner et al (1994 Rosenfeld (1994   Many of the knowledge sources used for this purpose score a sentence hypothesis by calculating a simple, typically linear, combination of scores associated with objects, such as N-grams and grammar rules, that characterize the hypothesis or its preferred linguistic analysis.  When these scores are viewed as log probabilities, taking a linear sum corresponds to making an independence assumption that is known to be at best only approximately true, and that may give rise to inaccuracies that reduce the effectiveness of the knowledge source.
