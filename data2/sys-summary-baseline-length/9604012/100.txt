 The introduction of two-level morphology and subsequent developments has made implementing computational-morphology models a feasible task.  Yet, two-level formalisms fell short from providing elegant means for the description of non-linear operations such as infixation, circumfixation and root-and-pattern morphology.  As a result, two-level implementations - e.g.  , , , - have always been biased towards linear morphology.  To test the validity of one's proposal or formalism, minimally a medium-scale description is a desideratum.  SemHe fulfils this requirement.  The paper assumes knowledge of multi-tape two-level morphology , .  sing.
