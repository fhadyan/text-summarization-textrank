 The introduction of two-level morphology and subsequent developments has made implementing computational-morphology models a feasible task.  Yet, two-level formalisms fell short from providing elegant means for the description of non-linear operations such as infixation, circumfixation and root-and-pattern morphology.  As a result, two-level implementations - e.g.  , , , - have always been biased towards linear morphology.  The past decade has seen a number of proposals for handling non-linear morphology; however, none (apart from Beesley's work) seem to have been implemented over large descriptions, nor have they provided means by which the grammarian can develop non-linear descriptions using higher level notation.  To test the validity of one's proposal or formalism, minimally a medium-scale description is a desideratum.  SemHe fulfils this requirement.  It is a generalised multi-tape two-level system which is being used in developing non-linear grammars.  This paper (1) presents the algorithms behind SemHe; (2) discusses the issues involved in compiling non-linear descriptions; and (3) proposes extension/solutions to make writing non-linear rules easier and more elegant.
