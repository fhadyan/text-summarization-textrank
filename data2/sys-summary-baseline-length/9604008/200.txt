 The Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP) model has a short, interesting, and controversial history.  It was introduced by Remko Scha , and was then studied by Rens Bod.  Unfortunately, Bod was not able to find an efficient exact algorithm for parsing using the model; however he did discover and implement Monte Carlo approximations.  He tested these algorithms on a cleaned up version of the ATIS corpus, and achieved some very exciting results, reportedly getting 96% of his test set exactly correct, a huge improvement over previous results.  For instance, Bod compares these results to Schabes , in which, for short sentences, 30% of the sentences have no crossing brackets (a much easier measure than exact match   Thus, Bod achieves an extraordinary 8-fold error rate reduction.  Not surprisingly, other researchers attempted to duplicate these results, but due to a lack of details of the parsing algorithm in his publications, these other researchers were not able to confirm the results (Magerman, Lafferty, personal communication   Parsing using the DOP model is especially difficult.
