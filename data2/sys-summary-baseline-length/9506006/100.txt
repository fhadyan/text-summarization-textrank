 Many, diverse tagged and parsed corpora have been developed.  Amongst the applications of annotated corpora are as training sets for the extraction of models used in speech and handwriting recognition.  Such training sets need to be as large as possible and there is anecdotal evidence that even the largest on its own is too small for a general statistical model of higher-level syntactic structure.  Existing corpora were not designed to a specific framework of annotations so corpora can not easily be collated into a single large training set.
