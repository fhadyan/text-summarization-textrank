 Correctly determining number is a difficult problem when translating from Japanese to English.  This is because in Japanese, noun phrases are not normally marked with respect to number.  Japanese nouns have no equivalent to the English singular and plural forms and verbs do not inflect to agree with the number of the subject .  In addition, there is no grammatical marking of countability.  Deciding this is a problem even for humans translating from Japanese to English, but they have their own knowledge of both languages to draw on.
