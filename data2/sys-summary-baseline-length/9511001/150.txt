 Correctly determining number is a difficult problem when translating from Japanese to English.  This is because in Japanese, noun phrases are not normally marked with respect to number.  Japanese nouns have no equivalent to the English singular and plural forms and verbs do not inflect to agree with the number of the subject .  In addition, there is no grammatical marking of countability.  In order to generate English correctly, it is necessary to know whether a given noun phrase is countable or uncountable and, if countable, whether it is singular or plural.  Deciding this is a problem even for humans translating from Japanese to English, but they have their own knowledge of both languages to draw on.  A machine translation system needs to have this knowledge codified in some way.  The results are summarized in Table .
