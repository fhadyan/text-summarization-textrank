 The wealth of literature on tone and intonation has amply demonstrated that voice pitch (F0) in speech is under independent linguistic control.  In English, voice pitch alone can signal the distinction between a statement and a question.  Similarly, in many tone languages,voice pitch alone signals the tense of a verb.  Phonologists usually describe a pitch contour much as they describe speech more generally, namely as a sequence of discrete units (i.e.  a transcription   This is illustrated in Figure 1, where L indicates a low tone and A promising way of generating contours from tone sequences is to specify one or more pitch targets per tone and then to interpolate between the targets; the task then becomes one of providing a suitable sequence of targets .  It is perhaps less clear how we should go about recognising tone sequences from pitch contours.  Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) Huang90 offer a powerful statistical approach to this problem, though it is unclear how they could be used to recognise the units of interest to phonologists.  Measurements were taken from the following data.
