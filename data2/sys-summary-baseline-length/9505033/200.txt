 Most of the more recent unification-based formalisms, such as TFS , UD , CUF , and FLUF , provide some possibility for the user to define constructions of his own.  This possibility can be more or less powerful in different formalisms.  There are, however, several constructions proposed as desirable extensions to unification grammars that cannot be defined in a general and well-defined way in these formalisms.  One such class of constructions is those that have some degree of nonmonotonic behaviour.  Examples of such constructions are any-values, default-values, and some constructions (e.g.  constraining equations, completeness and coherence) used in LFG .  This paper describes a method that permits the user to define such nonmonotonic constructions.  This is done through generalizing the work on nonmonotonic sorts .  This generalization results in a default logic similar to , but where subsumption and unification are used instead of logical truth and consistency.  There are three main advantages to Young and Rounds' work compared with other approaches to default unification , , which justify choosing it as a starting point for this work.
