 Most computational models of discourse are based primarily on an analysis of the intentions of the speakers (e.g , ,   An agent has certain goals, and communication results from a planning process to achieve these goals.  The speaker will form intentions based on the goals and then act on these intentions, producing utterances.  The hearer will then reconstruct a model of the speaker's intentions upon hearing the utterance.  This approach has many strong points, but does not provide a very satisfactory account of the adherence to discourse conventions in dialogue.
