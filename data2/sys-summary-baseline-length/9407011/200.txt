 Most computational models of discourse are based primarily on an analysis of the intentions of the speakers (e.g , ,   An agent has certain goals, and communication results from a planning process to achieve these goals.  The speaker will form intentions based on the goals and then act on these intentions, producing utterances.  The hearer will then reconstruct a model of the speaker's intentions upon hearing the utterance.  This approach has many strong points, but does not provide a very satisfactory account of the adherence to discourse conventions in dialogue.  For instance, consider one simple phenomena: a question is typically followed by an answer, or some explicit statement of an inability or refusal to answer.  The intentional story account of this goes as follows.  From the production of a question by Agent B, Agent A recognizes Agent B's goal to find out the answer, and she adopts a goal to tell B the answer in order to be co-operative.  A then plans to achieve the goal, thereby generating the answer.  Specific obligations arise from a variety of sources.
