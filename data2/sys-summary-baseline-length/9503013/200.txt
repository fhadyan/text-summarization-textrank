 Following the work of, for example, Marslen-Wilson (1973 Just and Carpenter (1980) and Altmann and Steedman (1988 it has become widely accepted that semantic interpretation in human sentence processing can occur before sentence boundaries and even before clausal boundaries.  It is less widely accepted that there is a need for incremental interpretation in computational applications.  In the 1970s and early 1980s several computational implementations motivated the use of incremental interpretation as a way of dealing with structural and lexical ambiguity (a survey is given in Haddock 1989   A sentence such as the following has 4862 different syntactic parses due solely to attachment ambiguity (Stabler 1991   put the bouquet of flowers that you gave me for Mothers' Day in the vase that you gave me for my birthday on the chest of drawers that you gave me for Armistice Day.  Although some of the parses can be ruled out using structural preferences during parsing (such as Late Closure or Minimal Attachment (Frazier 1979 extraction of the correct set of plausible readings requires use of real world knowledge.
