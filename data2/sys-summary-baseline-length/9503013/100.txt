 Following the work of, for example, Marslen-Wilson (1973 Just and Carpenter (1980) and Altmann and Steedman (1988 it has become widely accepted that semantic interpretation in human sentence processing can occur before sentence boundaries and even before clausal boundaries.  It is less widely accepted that there is a need for incremental interpretation in computational applications.  In the 1970s and early 1980s several computational implementations motivated the use of incremental interpretation as a way of dealing with structural and lexical ambiguity (a survey is given in Haddock 1989   Resnik 1992   1983
