 The purpose of our paper is to develop a principled technique for attaching a probabilistic interpretation to feature structures.  Our techniques apply to the feature structures described by Carpenter .  Since these structures are the ones which are used in by Pollard and Sag their relevance to computational grammars is apparent.  On the basis of the usefulness of probabilistic context-free grammars , ch.  5 it is plausible to assume that that the extension of probabilistic techniques to such structures will allow the application of known and new techniques of parse ranking and grammar induction to more interesting grammars than has hitherto been the case.  The paper is structured as follows.  We start by reviewing the training and use of probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs   We then develop a technique to allow analogous probabilistic annotations on type hierarchies.  which are generated.
