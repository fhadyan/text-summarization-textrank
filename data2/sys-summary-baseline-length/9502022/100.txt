 The purpose of our paper is to develop a principled technique for attaching a probabilistic interpretation to feature structures.  Our techniques apply to the feature structures described by Carpenter .  Since these structures are the ones which are used in by Pollard and Sag their relevance to computational grammars is apparent.  On the basis of the usefulness of probabilistic context-free grammars , ch.  The paper is structured as follows.  We start by reviewing the training and use of probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs   We conclude by sketching a technique which does treat such structures.
