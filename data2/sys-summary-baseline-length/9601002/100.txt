 Grammatical theories always make a distinction between unmarked and marked phenomena.  The general case is to use certain mechanisms which are likely to deal with regular behaviour.  More complex mechanisms should be available when exceptional behaviour is present.  However, this difference is not formally expressed in most grammar accounts of complex phenomena.  The need to restrict licensing of additional grammar resources is commonly asserted outside of the formal framework used.  As exceptional rules involve a higher computational cost, parsing processes associated to such formalisms become computationally intractable.  Let stand for .
