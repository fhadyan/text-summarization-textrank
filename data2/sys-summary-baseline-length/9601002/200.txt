 Grammatical theories always make a distinction between unmarked and marked phenomena.  The general case is to use certain mechanisms which are likely to deal with regular behaviour.  More complex mechanisms should be available when exceptional behaviour is present.  However, this difference is not formally expressed in most grammar accounts of complex phenomena.  The need to restrict licensing of additional grammar resources is commonly asserted outside of the formal framework used.  As exceptional rules involve a higher computational cost, parsing processes associated to such formalisms become computationally intractable.  Non-constituent coordination treatments show this pattern.  In general, a conjunction combines constituents.  But there are cases where the conjunction coordinates linguistic elements which do not form a constituent.  For instance, consider `John went to Alabama in summer and to Spain in fall   The conjunction `and' is coordinating `to Alabama in summer' with `to Spain in fall which do not form constituents.  The solutions displayed in the literature incorporate additional grammatical resources to deal with such data.  That makes parsing time of the grammar exponential in the length of the string.
