 Analyzing compound nouns is one of the crucial issues for natural language processing systems, in particular for those systems that aim at a wide coverage of domains.  Registering all compound nouns in a dictionary is an impractical approach, since we can create a new compound noun by combining nouns.  Therefore, a mechanism to analyze the structure of a compound noun from the individual nouns is necessary.  In order to identify structures of a compound noun, we must first find a set of words that compose the compound noun.  This task is trivial for languages such as English, where words are separated by spaces.  The situation is worse, however, in Japanese where no spaces are placed between words.  The process to identify word boundaries is usually called segmentation.  In processing languages such as Japanese, ambiguities in segmentation should be resolved at the same time as analyzing structure.  For instance, the Japanese compound noun SinGataKansetuZei new indirect tax produces 16 2[4 segementations possibilities for this case.  Segmentation of Japanese is difficult only when using syntactic knowledge.  Fuzisaki et al.
