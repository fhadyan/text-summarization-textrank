 This paper describes part of our ongoing investigation on the use of formal deduction in linear logic to explicate the relationship between syntactic analyses in Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) and semantic interpretations.  The use of formal deduction in semantic interpretation was implicit in deductive systems for categorial syntax , and has been made explicit through applications of the Curry-Howard parallelism between proofs and terms in more recent work on categorial semantics , , labeled deductive systems and flexible categorial systems .  For example, the f-structure for sentence is given in .
