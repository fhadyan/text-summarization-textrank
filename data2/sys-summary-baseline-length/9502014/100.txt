 Dalrymple, Shieber and Pereira DalShiPer:eahu (henceforth, DSP) give an equational treatment of ellipsis via higher-order unification which, amongst other things, provides an insightful analysis of the interactions between ellipsis and quantification.  But it suffers a number of drawbacks, especially when viewed from a computational perspective.  First, the precise order in which quantifiers are scoped and ellipses resolved determines the final interpretation of elliptical sentences.  Yet many systems, for good practical reasons, employ this kind of architecture.  The paper is organised as follows.
