 Most spoken language translation systems rely on a pipelined architecture, including speech recognition, linguistic analysis, transfer, generation and speech synthesis.  A major advantage is that components can be developed and tested independently.

An obvious disadvantage is brittleness: if one model fails to produce or pass on a correct interpretation, the whole translation process fails.  The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
