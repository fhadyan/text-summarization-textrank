 Previous work by Manny Rayner and the author, see attempts to tailor an existing natural-language system to a specific application domain by extracting a specialized grammar from the original one using a large set of training examples.  The training set is a treebank consisting of implicit parse trees that each specify a verified analysis of an input sentence.  Figure shows five examples of implicit parse trees.  For example, cutting up the first parse tree of Figure at the NP of the rule vp_v_np yields rules 2 and 3 of Figure .
