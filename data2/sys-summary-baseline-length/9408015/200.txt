 A common assumption in work on collaborative problem solving is that interaction should be efficient.  When language is the mode of interaction, the measure of efficiency has been, in the main, the number of utterances required to complete the dialogue .  One problem with this efficiency measure is that it ignores the cognitive effort required by resource limited agents in collaborative problem solving.  Another problem is that an utterance-based efficiency measure shows no sensitivity to the required quality and robustness of the problem solution.  Cognitive effort is involved in processes such as making inferences and swapping items from long term memory into working memory.  When agents have limited working memory, then only a limited number of items can be SALIENT, i.e.  accessible in working memory.  Since other processes, e.g.  inference, operate on salient items, an inference process may require the cognitive effort involved with retrieving items from long term memory, in addition to the effort involved with reasoning itself.  The required quality and robustness of the problem solution often determines exactly how much cognitive effort is required.  See figure .
