 A text is not just a sequence of words, but it has coherent structure.  The meaning of each word can not be determined until it is placed in the structure of the text.  Recognizing the structure of text is an essential task in text understanding, especially in resolving anaphora and ellipsis.  One of the constituents of the text structure is a text segment.  A text segment, whether or not it is explicitly marked, as are sentences and paragraphs, is defined as a sequence of clauses or sentences that display local coherence.  It resembles a scene in a movie, which describes the same objects in the same situation.  This paper proposes an indicator, called the lexical cohesion profile (LCP which locates segment boundaries in a narrative text.  LCP is a record of lexical cohesiveness of words in a sequence of text.  Lexical cohesiveness is defined as word similarity (Kozima and Furugori, 1993) computed by spreading activation on a semantic network.  Hills and valleys of LCP closely correlate with changing of segments.  systematic and non-systematic semantic relation.
