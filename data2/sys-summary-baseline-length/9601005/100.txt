 A text is not just a sequence of words, but it has coherent structure.  The meaning of each word can not be determined until it is placed in the structure of the text.  Recognizing the structure of text is an essential task in text understanding, especially in resolving anaphora and ellipsis.  One of the constituents of the text structure is a text segment.  It resembles a scene in a movie, which describes the same objects in the same situation.  Hills and valleys of LCP closely correlate with changing of segments.
