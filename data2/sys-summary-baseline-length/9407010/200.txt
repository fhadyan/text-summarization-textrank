 During the last few years, the previously separate fields of speech and natural language processing have moved much closer together, and it is now common to see integrated systems containing components for both speech recognition and language processing.  An immediate problem is the nature of the interface between the two.  A popular solution has been the N-best list e.g.  ; for some N, the speech recognizer hands the language processor the N utterance hypotheses it considers most plausible.  The recognizer chooses the hypotheses on the basis of the acoustic information in the input signal and, usually, a simple language model such as a bigram grammar.  The language processor brings more sophisticated linguistic knowledge sources to bear, typically some form of syntactic and/or semantic analysis, and uses them to choose the most plausible member of the N-best list.  We will call an algorithm that selects a member of the N-best list a preference method.  The most common preference method is to select the highest member of the list that receives a valid semantic analysis.  We will refer to this as the highest-in-coverage method.
