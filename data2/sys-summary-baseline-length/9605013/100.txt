 We address the problem of automatically acquiring case frame patterns (selectional patterns) from large corpus data.  The acquisition of case frame patterns normally involves the following three subproblems: 1) Extracting case frames from corpus data, 2) Generalizing case frame slots within these case frames, 3) Learning dependencies that exist between these generalized case frame slots.  In this paper, we propose a method of learning dependencies between case frame slots.  As illustrative examples, consider the following sentences.  P(arg2=1,prep=1) ] 0.25 .
