 We address the problem of automatically acquiring case frame patterns (selectional patterns) from large corpus data.  The acquisition of case frame patterns normally involves the following three subproblems: 1) Extracting case frames from corpus data, 2) Generalizing case frame slots within these case frames, 3) Learning dependencies that exist between these generalized case frame slots.  In this paper, we propose a method of learning dependencies between case frame slots.  By `dependency' is meant the relation that exists between case slots which constrains the possible values assumed by each of those case slots.  As illustrative examples, consider the following sentences.  We see that an `airline company' can be the subject of verb `fly' (the value of slot `arg1 when the direct object (the value of slot `arg2 is an `airplane' but not when it is an `airline company   These examples indicate that the possible values of case slots depend in general on those of the other case slots: that is, there exist `dependencies' between different case slots.
