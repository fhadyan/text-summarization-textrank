 In the past years, multiple inheritance has been increasingly used for the description of natural languages.  Some examples are the work in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG) on the structure of the lexicon , , semantic sorts for selectional restrictions , derivational morphology , , and the syntax of English relative clauses .  As an example of this type of analysis, figure shows a recent HPSG description of English clauses.  Section shows that unification in multi-dimensional inheritance hierarchies can be implemented efficiently as unification of a Prolog term representation of the types.
