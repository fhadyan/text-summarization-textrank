 In the past years, multiple inheritance has been increasingly used for the description of natural languages.  Some examples are the work in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG) on the structure of the lexicon , , semantic sorts for selectional restrictions , derivational morphology , , and the syntax of English relative clauses .  As an example of this type of analysis, figure shows a recent HPSG description of English clauses.  In the example, relative clauses are cross-classified according to two dimensions on the one hand according to the Phrase-Type (Headed or Non-Headed and on the other hand according to the Clause-Type (Interrogative, Declarative, or Relative   The choices within one dimension are mutually exclusive: no structure can be described as both Headed and Non-Headed, or as more than one of {Int, Decl, Rel   However, a structure can be assigned types from different dimensions, without the need for a subtype that inherits from both dimensions.  Section shows that unification in multi-dimensional inheritance hierarchies can be implemented efficiently as unification of a Prolog term representation of the types.
