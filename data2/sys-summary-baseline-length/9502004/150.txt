 Recently, there has been a lot of interest in Earley deduction with applications to parsing and generation , , , .  Earley deduction is a very attractive framwork for natural language processing because it has the following properties and applications.  Memoization and reuse of partial results Incremental processing by addition of new items Hypothetical reasoning by keeping track of dependencies between items Best-first search by means of an agenda Like Earley's algorithm, all of these approaches operate top-down (backward chaining   The interest has naturally focussed on top-down methods because they are at least to a certain degree goal-directed.  Data-Driven Processing: Top-down algorithms are not well suited for processing grammatical theories like Categorial Grammar or HPSG that would only allow very general predictions because they make use of general schemata instead of construction-specific rules.  sign(X) phrasal_sign(X
