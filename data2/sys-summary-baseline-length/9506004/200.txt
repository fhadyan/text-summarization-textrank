 Many theories of semantic interpretation use -term CCG is a grammatical formalism in which there is a one-to-one correspondence between the rules of composition at the level of syntax and logical form.  Each word is (perhaps ambiguously) assigned a category and LF, and when the syntactical operations assign a new category to a constituent, the corresponding semantic operations produce a new LF for that constituent as well.  The CCG rules shown in Figure 1 are implemented in the system described in this paper.  Each of the three operations have both a forward and backward variant.  As an illustration of how the semantic rules can be simulated in first-order unification, consider the derivation of the constituent harry found, where harry has the category np with LF harry' and found is a transitive verb of category with LF (5) In the CCG formalism, the derivation is as follows: harry gets raised with the ]T rule, and then forward composed by the ]B rule with found, and the result is a category of type s/np with LF .
