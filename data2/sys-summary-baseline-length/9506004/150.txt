 Many theories of semantic interpretation use -term CCG is a grammatical formalism in which there is a one-to-one correspondence between the rules of composition at the level of syntax and logical form.  Each word is (perhaps ambiguously) assigned a category and LF, and when the syntactical operations assign a new category to a constituent, the corresponding semantic operations produce a new LF for that constituent as well.  The CCG rules shown in Figure 1 are implemented in the system described in this paper.  Each of the three operations have both a forward and backward variant.  In section 3 it will be seen how the use of abstract syntax allows this to be expressed directly.  In first-order unification, it is simulated as shown in Figure 2.
