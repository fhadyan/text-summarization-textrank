 Many theories of semantic interpretation use -term CCG is a grammatical formalism in which there is a one-to-one correspondence between the rules of composition at the level of syntax and logical form.  Each word is (perhaps ambiguously) assigned a category and LF, and when the syntactical operations assign a new category to a constituent, the corresponding semantic operations produce a new LF for that constituent as well.  The CCG rules shown in Figure 1 are implemented in the system described in this paper.
