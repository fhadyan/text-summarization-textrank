 Tense interpretation has received much attention in linguistics , , , inter alia] and natural language processing , , , inter alia   Several researchers , , , have sought to explain the temporal relations induced by tense by treating it as anaphoric, drawing on Reichenbach's separation between event, speech, and reference times .  Specifically, to account for the forward progression of time induced by successive simple past tenses in a narrative, they treat the simple past as referring to a time evoked by a previous past tense.  For instance, in Hinrichs's proposal, accomplishments and achievements introduce a new reference point that is temporally ordered after the time of the event itself, ensuring that two consecutive accomplishments or achievements in a discourse are always ordered in a temporal sequence On the other hand, Lascarides and Asher take the view that temporal relations are resolved purely as a by-product of reasoning about coherence relations holding between utterances, and in doing so, argue that treating simple and complex tenses as anaphoric is unnecessary.
