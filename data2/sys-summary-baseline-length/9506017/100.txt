 To predict and track the center of attention in discourse, theories of centering (Grosz et al 1983; Brennan et al 1987; Grosz et al 1989) and immediate focus (Sidner, 1986) rely on syntactic and grammatical features of the text such as pronominalization and surface sentence position.  This may be sufficient for written discourse.  For oral discourse, however, we must also consider the way intonation affects the interpretation of a sentence, especially the cases in which it alters the predictions of centering theories.
