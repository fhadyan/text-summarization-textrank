 Recently various methods for automatically constructing a thesaurus (hierarchically clustering words) based on corpus data have been proposed , , , .  The realization of such an automatic construction method would make it possible to a) save the cost of constructing a thesaurus by hand, b) do away with subjectivity inherent in a hand made thesaurus, and c) make it easier to adapt a natural language processing system to a new domain.  In this paper, we propose a new method for automatic construction of thesauri.  Specifically, we view the problem of automatically clustering words as that of estimating a joint distribution over the Cartesian product of a partition of a set of nouns (in general, any set of words) and a partition of a set of verbs (in general, any set of words and propose an estimation algorithm using simulated annealing with an energy function based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) Principle.  The MDL Principle is a well-motivated and theoretically sound principle for data compression and estimation in information theory and statistics.  Labs.  Labs.
