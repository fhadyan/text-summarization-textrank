 Recently various methods for automatically constructing a thesaurus (hierarchically clustering words) based on corpus data have been proposed , , , .  The realization of such an automatic construction method would make it possible to a) save the cost of constructing a thesaurus by hand, b) do away with subjectivity inherent in a hand made thesaurus, and c) make it easier to adapt a natural language processing system to a new domain.  In this paper, we propose a new method for automatic construction of thesauri.  The MDL Principle is a well-motivated and theoretically sound principle for data compression and estimation in information theory and statistics.  As a strategy of statistical estimation MDL is guaranteed to be near optimal.  We empirically evaluated the effectiveness of our method.  A noun partition is any set satisfying , and .
