 There are a number of ways of measuring properties of text, and from there proceeding to make stylistic judgments; they can be found in style guides, and include calculating readability indices, counting the number of passive constructions, and so on.  One attribute of text that is rarely mentioned explicitly in these style guides, but which underpins many of the pieces of advice, is that of SEMANTIC DENSITY (see Dras and Dale, 1995   Consider the following pair of sentences, taken from Halliday (1985 It is apparent that the first of the pair is `denser' than the second: both express the same (propositional) meaning, but the first does so in a more compact way.  Halliday terms this LEXICAL DENSITY, `the density with which information is presented' (p68 and measures it by looking at the proportion of CONTENT WORDS.  Halliday adopts a fairly standard conception of content words as those which belong to the open word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives and so on.  However, this idea needs to be further refined.
