 In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in statistical approaches to natural language processing.  Such approaches are not new, witness the statistical approach to machine translation suggested by Weaver (1955 but the current level of interest is largely due to the success of applying hidden Markov models and N-gram language models in speech recognition.  This success was directly measurable in terms of word recognition error rates, prompting language processing researchers to seek corresponding improvements in performance and robustness.  rational debate.
