 In this paper, we present a new method for characterizing the interpretive possibilities generated by elliptical constructions in natural language.  Unlike previous analyses, which postulate ambiguity of interpretation or derivation in the full clause source of the ellipsis, our analysis requires no such hidden ambiguity.  For example, the ambiguity typically characterized as enabling strict versus sloppy readings of elliptical constructions does not arise from a corresponding ambiguity as to whether the pronoun in the antecedent clause is given a strict or sloppy interpretation; instead, the ambiguity follows from the process of interpreting the elided phrase on the basis of its unambiguous antecedent.  It predicts correctly a wide range of interactions between ellipsis and other semantic phenomena such as quantifier scope and bound anaphora.  The analysis we present is intended to characterize the semantics of constructions involving ellipsis.
