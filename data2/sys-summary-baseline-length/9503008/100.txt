 In this paper, we present a new method for characterizing the interpretive possibilities generated by elliptical constructions in natural language.  Unlike previous analyses, which postulate ambiguity of interpretation or derivation in the full clause source of the ellipsis, our analysis requires no such hidden ambiguity.  It predicts correctly a wide range of interactions between ellipsis and other semantic phenomena such as quantifier scope and bound anaphora.  Finally, although the analysis itself is stated nonprocedurally, it admits of a direct computational method for generating interpretations.  and George does too
