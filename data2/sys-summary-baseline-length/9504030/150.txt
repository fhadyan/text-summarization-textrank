 Parsing a natural language sentence can be viewed as making a sequence of disambiguation decisions: determining the part-of-speech of the words, choosing between possible constituent structures, and selecting labels for the constituents.  Traditionally, disambiguation problems in parsing have been addressed by enumerating possibilities and explicitly declaring knowledge which might aid the disambiguation process.  However, these approaches have proved too brittle for most interesting natural language problems.  This work addresses the problem of automatically discovering the disambiguation criteria for all of the decisions made during the parsing process, given the set of possible features which can act as disambiguators.  The candidate disambiguators are the words in the sentence, relationships among the words, and relationships among constituents already constructed in the parsing process.  Instead, all decisions are pursued non-deterministically according to the probability of each choice.
