 Unless a keyboard user is particularly proficient, a frustrating amount of time is usually spent backtracking to pick up mis-typed or otherwise mistaken input.  Work described in this paper started from an idea of an error processor that would sit on top of an editor, detecting/correcting errors just after entry, while the user continued with further text, relieved from tedious backtracking.  Hence `co-operative' error processing.  To date, grammar checkers and other programs which deal with illformed input usually step directly from spelling considerations to a full-scale sentence parse.
