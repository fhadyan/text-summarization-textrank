 In order to develop a practical natural language processing (NLP) system, it is essential to deal with ill-formed sentences that cannot be parsed correctly according to the grammar rules in the system.  In this paper, an ill-formed sentence means one that cannot be parsed as a unified structure.  A syntactic parser with general grammar rules is often unable to analyze not only sentences with grammatical errors and ellipses, but also long sentences, owing to their complexity.  Thus, ill-formed sentences include not only ungrammatical sentences, but also some grammatical sentences that cannot be parsed as unified structures owing to the presence of unknown words or to a lack of completeness in the syntactic parser.  In texts from a restricted domain, such as computer manuals, most sentences are grammatically correct.  However, even a well-established syntactic parser usually fails to generate a unified parsed structure for about 10 to 20 percent of all the sentences in such texts, and the failure to generate a unified parsed structure in syntactic analysis leads to a failure in the output of a NLP system.
