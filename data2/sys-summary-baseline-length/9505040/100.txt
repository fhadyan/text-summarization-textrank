 Text chunking involves dividing sentences into nonoverlapping segments on the basis of fairly superficial analysis.  Abney has proposed this as a useful and relatively tractable precursor to full parsing, since it provides a foundation for further levels of analysis including verb-argument identification, while still allowing more complex attachment decisions to be postponed to a later phase.  Since chunking includes identifying the non-recursive portions of noun phrases, it can also be useful for other purposes including index term generation.  Abney has proposed text chunking as a useful preliminary step to parsing.
