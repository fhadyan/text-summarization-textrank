 Certain researchers in the psycholinguistic community (Pritchett (1992 Gorrell (in press have argued for a binary distinction between two distinct types of garden path sentences.  Conscious garden paths, such as (1) below, are locally ambiguous sentences which give rise to reanalysis that is both experimentally detectable and causes a conscious sensation of difficulty or surprise effect   Unconscious garden paths, on the other hand, such as (2 cause reanalysis which is experimentally detectable, but which is generally not noticed by the speaker or hearer.  (1) While John was eating the ice cream melted.  (2) John knows the truth hurts.  This core parser has been the subject of a number of computational implementations, including Marcus's deterministic parser (1980 Description theory (henceforth, D-theory) (Marcus et al (1983 and Abney's licensing based model (1987, 1989   It has also been the subject of a number of psycholinguistic studies on a more theoretical level (Pritchett (1992 Gorrell (in press   Gorrell restricts this constraint to Primary structural relations (i.e.  an NP
