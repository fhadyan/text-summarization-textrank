 Conversation between two people has a number of characteristics that have yet to be modeled adequately in human-computer dialogue.  Conversation is BIDIRECTIONAL; there is a two way flow of information between participants.  Information is exchanged by MIXED-INITIATIVE.  Each participant will, on occasion, take the conversational lead.  Conversational partners not only respond to what others say, but feel free to volunteer information that is not requested and sometimes ask questions of their own .  As INITIATIVE passes back and forth between the discourse participants, we say that CONTROL over the conversation gets transferred from one discourse participant to another.  Why should we, as computational linguists, be interested in factors that contribute to the interactivity of a discourse? There are both theoretical and practical motivations.  In this paper we focus on interactive discourse.  See Figure .
