 In this paper we are concerned with the syntactic analysis phase of a natural language understanding system.  Ordinarily, the input of such a system is a sequence of words.  However, following Bernard Lang we argue that it might be fruitful to take the input more generally as a finite state automaton (FSA) to model cases in which we are uncertain about the actual input.  Parsing uncertain input might be necessary in case of ill-formed textual input, or in case of speech input.  For example, if a natural language understanding system is interfaced with a speech recognition component, chances are that this compenent is uncertain about the actual string of words that has been uttered, and thus produces a word lattice of the most promising hypotheses, rather than a single sequence of words.  FSA of course generalizes such word lattices.  As another example, certain techniques to deal with ill-formed input can be characterized as finite state transducers ; the composition of an input string with such a finite state transducer results in a FSA that can then be input for syntactic parsing.
