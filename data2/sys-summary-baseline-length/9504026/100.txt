 In this paper we are concerned with the syntactic analysis phase of a natural language understanding system.  Ordinarily, the input of such a system is a sequence of words.  However, following Bernard Lang we argue that it might be fruitful to take the input more generally as a finite state automaton (FSA) to model cases in which we are uncertain about the actual input.  Parsing uncertain input might be necessary in case of ill-formed textual input, or in case of speech input.  FSA of course generalizes such word lattices.
