 We have developed an automatic abstract generation system for Japanese expository writings based on rhetorical structure extraction.  The system first extracts the rhetorical structure, the compound of the rhetorical relations between sentences, and then cuts out less important parts in the extracted structure to generate an abstract of the desired length.  Evaluation of the generated abstract showed that it contains at maximum 74% of the most important sentences of the original text.  The system is now utilized as a text browser for a prototypical interactive document retrieval system.  Abstract generation is, like Machine Translation, one of the ultimate goal of Natural Language Processing.  However, since conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems(e.g.  ) are lacking in inter-sentential or discourse-structural analysis, they are liable to generate incoherent abstracts.  On the other hand, conventional knowledge or script-based abstract generation systems(e.g.  , owe their success to the limitation of the domain, and cannot be applied to document with varied subjects, such as popular scientific magazine.  Abstract generation is realized as a suitable application of the extracted rhetorical structure.
