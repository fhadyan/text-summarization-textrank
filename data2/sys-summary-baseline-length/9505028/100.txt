 We define a new grammar formalism, called D-Tree Grammars (DTG which arises from work on Tree-Adjoining Grammars (TAG) .  A salient feature of TAG is the extended domain of locality it provides.  Each elementary structure can be associated with a lexical item (as in Lexicalized TAG (LTAG)   Properties related to the lexical item (such as subcategorization, agreement, certain types of word order variation) can be expressed within the elementary structure , .  TAG, however, has two limitations which provide the motivation for this work.
