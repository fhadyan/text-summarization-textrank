 We define a new grammar formalism, called D-Tree Grammars (DTG which arises from work on Tree-Adjoining Grammars (TAG) .  A salient feature of TAG is the extended domain of locality it provides.  Each elementary structure can be associated with a lexical item (as in Lexicalized TAG (LTAG)   Properties related to the lexical item (such as subcategorization, agreement, certain types of word order variation) can be expressed within the elementary structure , .  In addition, TAG remain tractable, yet their generative capacity is sufficient to account for certain syntactic phenomena that, it has been argued, lie beyond Context-Free Grammars (CFG) .  TAG, however, has two limitations which provide the motivation for this work.  The first problem (discussed in Section ) is that the TAG operations of substitution and adjunction do not map cleanly onto the relations of complementation and modification.  A second problem (discussed in Section ) has to do with the inability of TAG to provide analyses for certain syntactic phenomena.  In purely CFG-based approaches, these relations are only implicit.
