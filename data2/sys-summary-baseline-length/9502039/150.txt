 Emergence of text categorization according to language came with the need of processing texts coming from all over the world.  The goal of text categorization is to tag texts with the name of the language in which they are written.  Information retrieval is the main application field.  To do this job, the traditionnal way is to exploit the difference between letter combinations in different languages .  For each language, the system computes from a training set a profile based on frequency (or probability) of letter sequences.  Then, for a given text, it computes a profile and select the language which has the closer profile.  While some text categorization systems give very good results, the major problem is that their quality is entirely based on the training set.  There is no linguistic justification.
