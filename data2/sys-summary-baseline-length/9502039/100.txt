 Emergence of text categorization according to language came with the need of processing texts coming from all over the world.  The goal of text categorization is to tag texts with the name of the language in which they are written.  Information retrieval is the main application field.

For each language, the system computes from a training set a profile based on frequency (or probability) of letter sequences.
