 It seems a perfectly valid rule of conversation not to tell people what they already know.  Indeed, Grice's QUANTITY maxim has often been interpreted this way: Do not make your contribution more informative than is required .  Stalnaker, as well, suggests that to assert something that is already presupposed is to attempt to do something that is already done .  Thus, the notion of what is informative is judged against a background of what is presupposed, i.e.  propositions that all conversants assume are mutually known or believed.  right.
