 It seems a perfectly valid rule of conversation not to tell people what they already know.  Indeed, Grice's QUANTITY maxim has often been interpreted this way: Do not make your contribution more informative than is required .  Stalnaker, as well, suggests that to assert something that is already presupposed is to attempt to do something that is already done .  Thus, the notion of what is informative is judged against a background of what is presupposed, i.e.  propositions that all conversants assume are mutually known or believed.  These propositions are known as the COMMON GROUND , .  The various formulations of this `no redundancy' rule permeate many computational analyses of natural language and notions of cooperativity.  Example 1: ( 6) r.  uh 2 tax questions.  yes it does.  IT DOES.
