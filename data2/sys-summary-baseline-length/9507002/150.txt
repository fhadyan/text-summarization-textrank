 The lexical framework presented here was born from the necessity of representing lexical information for the ARIES project , where it is integrated.  We are going to describe here the language used to represent surface aspects of the lexicon, the devices designed, and the methods to develop application oriented, fast access dictionaries.  We summarize here some features of our representation language: Expressiveness: All the information needed in the lexical database can be expressed, and structure can be imposed on it.  Linguistic generalizations are captured by grouping related entries in lemmas, or by using the mechanism of information inheritance.  The information related to a lemma is structured in a tree-shaped feature bundle attached to it.  This decision has proved to be right for morphology related information or low level syntactic features.
