 Bag generation is a form of natural language generation in which the input is a bag (also known as a multiset: a set in which repeated elements are significant) of lexical elements and the output is a grammatical sentence or a statistically most probable permutation with respect to some language model.  Bag generation has been considered within the statistical and rule-based paradigms of computational linguistics, and each has handled this problem differently , , , .  This paper only considers rule based approaches to this problem.  Bag generation has received particular attention in lexicalist approaches to MT, as exemplified by Shake-and-Bake generation , .  One can also envisage applications of bag generation to generation from minimally recursive semantic representations and other semantic frameworks which separate scoping from content information .  We distinguish variables by uniquely typing them.  Consider Example .
