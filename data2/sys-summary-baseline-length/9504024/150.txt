 Semitic is known amongst computational linguists, in particular computational morphologists, for its highly inflexional morphology.  Its root-and-pattern phenomenon not only poses difficulties for a morphological system, but also makes error detection a difficult task.  This paper aims at presenting a morphographemic model which can cope with both issues.  The following convention has been adopted.  Morphemes are represented in braces, { surface (phonological) forms in solidi, / and orthographic strings in acute brackets, .  In examples of grammars, variables begin with a capital letter.  Cs denote consonants, Vs denote vowels and a bar denotes complement.  An asterisk, indicates ill-formed strings.  The difficulties in morphological analysis and error detection in Semitic arise from the following facts: A Semitic stem consists of a and a , arranged according to a .  /n et
