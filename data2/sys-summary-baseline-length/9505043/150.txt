 The goal of an Information Extraction (IE) system is to identify information of interest from a collection of texts.  Within a particular text, objects of interest are often referenced in different places and in different ways.  One of the many challenges facing an IE system is to determine which references refer to which objects.  This problem can be recast as a classification problem: given two references, do they refer to the same object or different objects.  The Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) , , and the Tipster Project helped both to define the information extraction task and to push the technology of IE systems.  The sentence analyzers used in many of these systems have shown significant improvement over the past several years.  The IE systems developed at UMass , , also displayed weak coreference resolution capabilities.
