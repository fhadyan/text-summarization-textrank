 The goal of an Information Extraction (IE) system is to identify information of interest from a collection of texts.  Within a particular text, objects of interest are often referenced in different places and in different ways.  One of the many challenges facing an IE system is to determine which references refer to which objects.  This problem can be recast as a classification problem: given two references, do they refer to the same object or different objects.  Some phrases are multireferent, i.e they refer to more than one object.
