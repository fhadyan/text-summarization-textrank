 The goal of an Information Extraction (IE) system is to identify information of interest from a collection of texts.  Within a particular text, objects of interest are often referenced in different places and in different ways.  One of the many challenges facing an IE system is to determine which references refer to which objects.  This problem can be recast as a classification problem: given two references, do they refer to the same object or different objects.  The Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) , , and the Tipster Project helped both to define the information extraction task and to push the technology of IE systems.  Each of these evaluation efforts provided a corpus of news articles about a domain, a specification of the relevant information that was to be extracted from each article, the output representation of that information, and a set of key templates representing the information extracted from each article by human readers.  The sentence analyzers used in many of these systems have shown significant improvement over the past several years.  The last four features focus on the pair of references.
