 Recently, there has been a growing interest in research on formalizing feature theory.  Some formalisms that appeared lately are the feature algebra of , the modal logic of , the deterministic finite automata of , and the first-order predicate logic of .  These formalisms describe the use of feature theory in computational linguistics.  They are a source of interesting technical research, and various complexity results have been achieved.  However, we argue that such formalisms offer little help to computational linguists in practice.  The grammatical theories used in computational linguistics do not consist of bare feature theories.  The feature theories that are used in computational linguistics are contained in unification grammars.  These unification grammars consist of constituent structure components, and feature theories.  We claim that the complexity results from the formalisms do no longer hold when a feature theory and a constituent structure component are combined into a unification grammar.  In this paper, we will focus on the complexity results that are obtained from formalizing feature theories.  Both proofs put the complexity results that have been achieved in a different perspective.  \t\t Step 1.
