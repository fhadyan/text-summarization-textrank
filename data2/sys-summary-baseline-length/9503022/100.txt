 Recently, there has been a growing interest in research on formalizing feature theory.  Some formalisms that appeared lately are the feature algebra of , the modal logic of , the deterministic finite automata of , and the first-order predicate logic of .  These formalisms describe the use of feature theory in computational linguistics.  They are a source of interesting technical research, and various complexity results have been achieved.  However, we argue that such formalisms offer little help to computational linguists in practice.  The outline of this paper is as follows.
