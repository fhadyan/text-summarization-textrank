 The division of morphology and syntax in agglutinative languages is difficult compared to relatively more isolating languages.  For instance, in Turkish, there is a significant amount of interaction between morphology and syntax.  Typical examples are: causative suffixes change the valence of the verb, and the reciprocal suffix subcategorize the verb for a noun phrase marked with the comitative case.  If syntactic composition is performed after morphological composition, we would get compositions such as [iyi [okumus ocuk or iyi okumus] ocuk which yield ill-formed semantics for this utterance.
