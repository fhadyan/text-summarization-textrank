 The division of morphology and syntax in agglutinative languages is difficult compared to relatively more isolating languages.  For instance, in Turkish, there is a significant amount of interaction between morphology and syntax.  Typical examples are: causative suffixes change the valence of the verb, and the reciprocal suffix subcategorize the verb for a noun phrase marked with the comitative case.  Moreover, the head that a bound morpheme modifies may be not its stem but a compound head crossing over the word boundaries, e.g 3iyi oku-mus ocuk well read-REL child 'well-educated child' In ( the relative suffix -mus (in past form of subject participle) modifies [iyi oku] to give the scope iyi oku]mus] ocuk   If syntactic composition is performed after morphological composition, we would get compositions such as [iyi [okumus ocuk or iyi okumus] ocuk which yield ill-formed semantics for this utterance.  As pointed out by Oehrle , , there is no reason to assume a layered grammatical architecture which has linguistic division of labor into components acting on one domain at a time.
