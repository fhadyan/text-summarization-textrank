 Transfer based approaches to machine translation (MT) involve three main phases: analysis, transfer and generation.  During analysis, the syntactic and semantic structure of a sentence is made explicit through a source language (SL) grammar and semantic processing modules.  The result of analysis is one or more syntactic and semantic representations which are used to construct a syntactic and/or semantic representation in the target language (TL) through a series of transfer rules and a bilingual lexicon.  From this representation a TL sentence is generated based on some form of mapping procedure, usually exploiting the TL grammar .  In this paper we describe a prototype implementation of a transfer MT system based on the lexicalist MT (LMT) approach of , also known as `Shake-and-Bake' (SB   For our implementation we have extended the original SB formulation by postulating bilingual lexical rules (bi-lexical rules henceforth) which dynamically expand the bilingual lexicon in order to extend its functionality.  This allows us to uniformly treat mono- and multi-lexeme translations in a variety of contexts.  We describe the main characteristics of the LMT approach.
