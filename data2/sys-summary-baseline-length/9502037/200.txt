 Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in probabilistic techniques for automatic language analysis.  In particular, there has arisen a distinct paradigm of processing on the basis of pre-analyzed data which has taken the name Data-Oriented Parsing.  Data Oriented Parsing (DOP) is a model where no abstract rules, but language experiences in the form of an analyzed corpus, constitute the basis for language processing There is not space here to present full justification for adopting such an approach or to detail the advantages that it offers.  The main claim it makes is that effective language processing requires a consideration of both the structural and statistical aspects of language, whereas traditional competence grammars rely only on the former, and standard statistical techniques such as n-gram models only on the latter.  DOP attempts to combine these two traditions and produce performance grammars which:   should not only contain information on the structural possibilities of the general language system, but also on details of actual language use in a language community This approach entails however that a corpus has first to be pre-analyzed (ie.  \t\t
