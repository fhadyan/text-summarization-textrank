 Methods for automatically classifying words according to their contexts of use have both scientific and practical interest.  The scientific questions arise in connection to distributional views of linguistic (particularly lexical) structure and also in relation to the question of lexical acquisition both from psychological and computational learning perspectives.  From the practical point of view, word classification addresses questions of data sparseness and generalization in statistical language models, particularly models for deciding among alternative analyses proposed by a grammar.  This requires a reasonable definition of verb similarity and a similarity estimation method.
