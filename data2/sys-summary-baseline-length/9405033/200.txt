 General-purpose natural language (NL) analysis systems have recently started to use declarative unification-based sentence grammar formalisms; systems of this type include SRI's CLARE system (Alshawi et al 1992) and the Alvey NL Tools (ANLT; Briscoe et al 1987a   Using a declarative formalism helps ease the task of developing and maintaining the grammar (Kaplan, 1987   In addition to syntactic processing, the systems incorporate lexical, morphological, and semantic processing, and have been applied successfully to the analysis of naturally-occurring texts (e.g.  Alshawi et al 1992; Briscoe Carroll, 1993   Evaluations of the grammars in these particular systems have shown them to have wide coverage (Alshawi et al 1992; Taylor, Grover Briscoe, 1989   However, although the practical throughput of parsers with such realistic grammars is important, for example when processing large amounts of text or in interactive applications, there is little published research that compares the performance of different parsing algorithms using wide-coverage unification-based grammars.
