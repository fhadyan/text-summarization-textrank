 The following paper presents an approach for automatic acquisition of linguistic knowledge from observations within a given domain; it thus addresses a topic from the field of machine learning (cf.  Michalski (1986 or more precisely, from the field of machine learning of natural language, as it is sometimes called (cf.  Powers and Reeker (1991   The last decade has seen a growing interest in the application of machine learning to different kinds of linguistic domains (cf.  Powers and Reeker (1991 and has been motivated by different objectives, such as modelling cognitive processes or overcoming the knowledge-acquisition bottleneck in natural-language processing systems.  The principal motivation for our approach is theoretical.  The automatically induced analyses can be compared to existing linguistic descriptions and thus can confirm proposed analyses or provide alternative representations.  On the other hand, the approach can be used by descriptive linguists as a tool to obtain a rough structuring of an entirely new domain (e.g.  a language that has not yet been investigated   The presented work was partly supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG   In Fig.
