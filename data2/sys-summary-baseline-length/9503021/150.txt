 Although a universal feature theory does not exist, there is a general understanding of its objects.  The objects of feature theories are abstract linguistic objects, e.g an object sentence an object masculine third person singular an object verb an object noun phrase These abstract objects have properties like tense number predicate subject The values of these properties are either atomic, like present and singular or abstract objects, like verb and noun-phrase The abstract objects are fully described by their properties and their values.  Multiple descriptions for the properties and values of the abstract linguistic objects are presented in the literature.  Examples are: 1.  Attribute-value matrices, which are matrices in which the entries consist of an attribute and a value or a reentrance symbol.  The values are either atomic or attribute-value matrices.
