 Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning grammatical categories to individual words in a corpus.  One widely used approach makes use of a statistical technique called a Hidden Markov Model (HMM   The model is defined by two collections of parameters: the transition probabilities, which express the probability that a tag follows the preceding one (or two for a second order model and the lexical probabilities, giving the probability that a word has a given tag without regard to words on either side of it.  To tag a text, the tags with non-zero probability are hypothesised for each word, and the most probable sequence of tags given the sequence of words is determined from the probabilities.  Two algorithms are commonly used, known as the Forward-Backward (FB) and Viterbi algorithms.  (1990
