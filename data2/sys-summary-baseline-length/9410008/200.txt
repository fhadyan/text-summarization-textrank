 There are different types of text.  Texts about the same thing may be in differing genres, of different types, and of varying quality.  Texts vary along several parameters, all relevant for the general information retrieval problem of matching reader needs and texts.  Given this variation, in a text retrieval context the problems are (i) identifying genres, and (ii) choosing criteria to cluster texts of the same genre, with predictable precision and recall.  This should not be confused with the issue of identifying topics, and choosing criteria that discriminate one topic from another.  Although not orthogonal to genre-dependent variation, the variation that relates directly to content and topic is along other dimensions.  Naturally, there is co-variance.  Texts about certain topics may only occur in certain genres, and texts in certain genres may only treat certain topics; most topics do, however, occur in several genres, which is what interests us here.  Douglas Biber has studied text variation along several parameters, and found that texts can be considered to vary along five dimensions.
