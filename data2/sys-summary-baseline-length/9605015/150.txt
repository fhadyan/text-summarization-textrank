 In this paper, we will describe how substantial domain-independent language-processing systems for French and Spanish were quickly developed by manually adapting an existing English system, the SRI Core Language Engine.  The resulting systems have been integrated as components in the Spoken Language Translator (SLT; ,   The English to French version of SLT is of a standard comparable to the original English to Swedish version.  There is a good treatment of inflectional morphology which includes all major paradigms.  The coverage of the Spanish grammar is comparable in scope, though slightly less extensive.  The French and Spanish versions of the CLE are both reversible and can be used for either analysis or generation.  Due to space limitations, and since it is rather the better of the two, we will concentrate on the French version.  Section concludes.  Section
