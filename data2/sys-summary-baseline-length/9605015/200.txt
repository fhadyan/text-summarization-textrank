 In this paper, we will describe how substantial domain-independent language-processing systems for French and Spanish were quickly developed by manually adapting an existing English system, the SRI Core Language Engine.  The resulting systems have been integrated as components in the Spoken Language Translator (SLT; ,   The English to French version of SLT is of a standard comparable to the original English to Swedish version.  The syntactic rule-set for French covers nearly all the basic constructions of the language, including the following: declarative, interrogative and imperative clauses; formation of YN and WH-questions using inversion, complex inversion and est-ce que clitic pronouns; adverbial modification; negation; nominal and verbal PPs; complements to `tre and il y a relative clauses, including those with dont partitives, including use of en passives; pre- and post-nominal adjectival modification, including comparative and superlative; code expressions; sentential complements and embedded questions; complex determiners; numerical expressions; date and time expressions; conjunction of most major constituents; and a wide variety of verb types, including modals and reflexives.
