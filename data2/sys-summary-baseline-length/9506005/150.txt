 Tagsets used in existing corpora have usually been designed to satisfy the needs of specific projects.  A tagset used for robust parsing will tend to stress distributional properties, whereas a corpus within a lexical resource specially designed for human interaction (which might include a human oriented dictionary) will most likely distinguish word classes along traditional linguistic lines.  The tool described in this paper performs tagset mapping with manually written rules to introduce a standardised morphosyntactic tagset.  Standardisation of tagsets has been a goal of some contemporary projects (e.g.  and the Text Encoding Initiative at the same time, it has been the object of much controversy because of the obvious advantages of tailoring tagsets to project needs.  Especially the manually analysed linguistic data is expensive to produce and extremely valuable.  The EAGLES expert group (cf.  section
