 If parsing is taken to be the first step in taming the natural language understanding task, then broad coverage NLP remains a jungle inhabited by wild beasts.  For instance, parsing noun compounds appears to require detailed world knowledge that is unavailable outside a limited domain (Sparck Jones, 1983   Yet, far from being an obscure, endangered species, the noun compound is flourishing in modern language.  It has already made five appearances in this paragraph and at least one diachronic study shows a veritable population explosion (Leonard, 1984   While substantial work on noun compounds exists in both linguistics (e.g.  Levi, 1978; Ryder, 1994) and computational linguistics (Finin, 1980; McDonald, 1982; Isabelle, 1984 techniques suitable for broad coverage parsing remain unavailable.  This renders their experiment inconclusive.
