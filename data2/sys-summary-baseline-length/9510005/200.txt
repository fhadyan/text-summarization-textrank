 This work is part of an effort to develop a robust, domain-independent syntactic parser capable of yielding the one correct analysis for unrestricted naturally-occurring input.  Our goal is to develop a system with performance comparable to extant part-of-speech taggers, returning a syntactic analysis from which predicate-argument structure can be recovered, and which can support semantic interpretation.  The requirement for a domain-independent analyser favours statistical techniques to resolve ambiguities, whilst the latter goal favours a more sophisticated grammatical formalism than is typical in statistical approaches to robust analysis of corpus material.  Briscoe and Carroll (1993) describe a probablistic parser using a wide-coverage unification-based grammar of English written in the Alvey Natural Language Tools (ANLT) metagrammatical formalism (Briscoe et al 1987 generating around 800 rules in a syntactic variant of the Definite Clause Grammar formalism (DCG, Pereira Warren, 1980) extended with iterative (Kleene) operators.  The ANLT grammar is linked to a lexicon containing about 64K entries for 40K lexemes, including detailed subcategorisation information appropriate for the grammar, built semi-automatically from a learners' dictionary (Carroll Grover, 1989
