 There is a large body of psycholinguistic evidence which suggests that meaning can be extracted before the end of a sentence, and before the end of phrasal constituents (e.g.  Marslen-Wilson 1973, Tanenhaus et al.  1990   There is also recent evidence suggesting that, during speech processing, partial interpretations can be built extremely rapidly, even before words are completed (Spivey-Knowlton et al.  1994   There are also potential computational applications for incremental interpretation, including early parse filtering using statistics based on logical form plausibility, and interpretation of fragments of dialogues (a survey is provided by Milward and Cooper, 1994, henceforth referred to as MC   In the current computational and psycholinguistic literature there are two main approaches to the incremental construction of logical forms.  One approach is to use a grammar with `non-standard' constituency, so that an initial fragment of a sentence, such as John likes, can be treated as a constituent, and hence be assigned a type and a semantics.  likes(john,x without having to say that John likes is a constituent.  1983   1990
