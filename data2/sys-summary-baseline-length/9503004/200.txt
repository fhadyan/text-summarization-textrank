 We earlier described two taggers for French: the statistical one having an accuracy of 95-97 % and the constraint-based one 97-99 % (see ,   The disambiguation has been already described, and here we discuss the other stages of the process, namely the definition of the tagset, transforming a current lexicon into a new one and guessing the words that do not appear in the lexicon.  Our lexicon is based on a finite-state transducer lexicon .  The French description was originally built by Annie Zaenen and Carol Neidle, and later refined by Jean-Pierre Chanod Ch94.  Related work on French can be found in .  We describe in this section criteria for selecting the tagset.  The following is based on what we noticed to be useful during the developing the taggers.  Our basic French morphological analyser was not originally designed for a (statistical) tagger and the number of different tag combinations it has is quite high.  The size of the tagset is only 88.  If we also consider words joined with clitics, the number of different combinations is much higher, namely 6525.  dballaduriser.
