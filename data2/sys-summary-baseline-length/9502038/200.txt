 Since the late '80s part-of-speech (POS) disambiguation using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) has been a widespread method for tagging texts.  Despite this fact, little work has been done so far toward employing this technology for the disambiguation of German texts (cf.  Earlier work of the author (Feldweg 1993 and 1995) within the framework of a project on corpus based development of lexical knowledge bases (ELWIS) has produced LIKELY, a straightforward implementation of the Viterbi algorithm employing an HMM whose parameters were obtained from a pre-tagged text corpus.  Since then the original tag set was redefined, making the tagged corpus used to train the LIKELY tagger obsolete.  Within a current project on adapting bilingual dictionaries for online comprehension assistance (COMPASS, LRE 62-080 the need arose for a POS-disambiguator to facilitate a context sensitive dictionary look-up system.  As the COMPASS project makes ample use of Xerox technology for its core look-up engine and for POS disambiguation for languages other than German, the obvious thing to do was to develop a German language model for the Xerox tagger.  noun vs.
