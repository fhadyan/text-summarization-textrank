 In collaborative expert-consultation dialogues, two participants (executing agent and consultant) work together to construct a plan for achieving the executing agent's domain goal.  The executing agent and the consultant bring to the plan construction task different knowledge about the domain and the desirable characteristics of the resulting domain plan.  For example, the consultant presumably has more extensive and accurate domain knowledge than does the executing agent, but the executing agent has knowledge about his particular circumstances, intentions, and preferences that are either restrictions on or potential influencers of the domain plan being constructed.  In agreeing to collaborate on constructing the domain plan, the consultant assumes a stake in the quality of the resultant plan and in how the agents go about constructing it.  Thus a collaborator is more than a cooperative respondent.
