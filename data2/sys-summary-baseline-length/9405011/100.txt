 In collaborative expert-consultation dialogues, two participants (executing agent and consultant) work together to construct a plan for achieving the executing agent's domain goal.  The executing agent and the consultant bring to the plan construction task different knowledge about the domain and the desirable characteristics of the resulting domain plan.  In agreeing to collaborate on constructing the domain plan, the consultant assumes a stake in the quality of the resultant plan and in how the agents go about constructing it.  Thus a collaborator is more than a cooperative respondent.
