 Intrasentential antecedents, i.e antecedents occurring in the same sentence as the anaphor, are a crucial issue for the anaphora resolution method.  The main problem is to determine the constraints that intrasentential phrases must respect in anaphoric relations.  These constraints are used to determine relations between a given anaphor and its antecedents.  Until now, this kind of constraint has been tackled mainly in terms of syntactic aspects, see and .  We propose to consider new kinds of criteria that combine semantic restrictions with sentence structure.  One of these criteria is, for example, the way in which the verb meaning influences the sentence structure, then the way in which the sentence structure influences the anaphoric relations between intrasentential phrases.  The structure we studied is the embedded sentence structure.  of France, Young Rubicam of the U.S.
