 Natural languages exhibit significant word order (WO) variation and intricate ordering rules.  Despite the fact that specific languages show less variation and complexity in such rules (e.  those characterized by either fixed, or totally free, WO the vast majority of world languages lie somewhere in-between these two extremes (e.  Steele 1981   Importantly, even the proclaimed examples of rigid WO languages (English) exhibit variation, whereas those with proclaimed total scrambling (Warlpiri; cf.  Hale 1981) show restrictions (Kashket 1987   Therefore, we need general grammar formalism, capable of processing "flexible" WO (i.e.  complex WO regularities, including both extremes   There seem to be a number of requirements that such a formalism should (try to) fulfil (e.
