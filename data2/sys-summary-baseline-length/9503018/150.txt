 A discourse strategy is a strategy for communicating with another agent.  Agents make strategy choices via decisions about when to talk, when to let the other agent talk, what to say, and how to say it.  One choice a conversational agent must make is whether an utterance should include some relevant, but optional, information in what is communicated.  For example, consider 1: Let's walk along Walnut St.  It's shorter.  The speaker made a strategic choice in 0 to include 0b since she could have simply said 0a.  What determines the speaker's choice? Existing dialogue systems have two modes for dealing with optional information: (1) include all optional information that is not already known to the hearer; (2) include no optional information .  route was shorter.
