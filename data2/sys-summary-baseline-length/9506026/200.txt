 In recent years, it has become common in the linguistics and philosophy literature to assume that events and processes are ontologically distinct entities, on a par with objects and substances.  At the same time, the idea that episodic knowledge should be represented as a collection of interrelated eventualities has gained increasing acceptance in the computational linguistics and artificial intelligence literature.  Contrary to what one might expect, a search through the prior literature in linguistics and philosophy reveals no account in which these sortal distinctions play a direct role in adequately explaining the problem of aspectual composition , .  In fact, amongst those that have explicitly considered this question, the consensus appears to be that no such explanation is likely to be found , , .  From a computational perspective this is rather unfortunate, since such distinctions have otherwise proved quite useful , , , .  In this paper, I set out to show that a sortal approach to aspectual composition, developed in the spirit of the eventuality-based work on episodic representation, can indeed be explanatory.
