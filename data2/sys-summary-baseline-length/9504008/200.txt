 Spoken language processing challenges for integration of speech recognition into natural language processing, and must deal with multi-level knowledge sources from signal level to symbol level.  The multi-level knowledge integration and handling increase the technical difficulty of both the speech and the natural language processing.  In the speech recognition side, the recognition must be at phoneme-level for large vocabulary continuous speech, and the speech recognition module must provide right level of outputs to the natural language module in the form of not single solution but many alternatives of solution hypotheses.  The n-best list [ word-graph [ and word-lattice [ ] techniques are mostly used in this purpose.  The speech recognition module can also ask the linguistic scores from the language processing module in a more tightly coupled bottom-up/top-down hybrid integration scheme [   In the natural language side, the insertion, deletion, and substitution errors of continuous speech must be compensated by robust parsing and partial parsing techniques, e.g.  Often the spoken languages are ungrammatical, fragmentary, and contain non-fluencies and speech repairs, and must be processed incrementally under the time constraints [
