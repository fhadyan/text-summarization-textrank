 In computational lexicology, three basic questions guide current research: (1) which knowledge should be in the lexicon, (2) how should this knowledge be represented (e.g to cope with the problems of lexical gaps and (3) how can this knowledge be acquired.  Current lexical research in language technology is eminently knowledge-based in this respect.  It is also generally acknowledged that there exists a natural order of dependencies between these three research questions: acquisition techniques depend on the type of knowledge representation used and the type of knowledge that should be acquired, and the type of knowledge representation used depends on what should be represented.  Different tasks require different lexical information.  Unfortunately, successful solutions are limited and few.  We try to automatically learn the language processing task on the basis of examples.
