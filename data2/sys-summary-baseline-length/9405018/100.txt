 In computational lexicology, three basic questions guide current research: (1) which knowledge should be in the lexicon, (2) how should this knowledge be represented (e.g to cope with the problems of lexical gaps and (3) how can this knowledge be acquired.  Current lexical research in language technology is eminently knowledge-based in this respect.  Different tasks require different lexical information.  Unfortunately, successful solutions are limited and few.  We try to automatically learn the language processing task on the basis of examples.  Consistency Heuristic.
