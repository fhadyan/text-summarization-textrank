 Unlike most linguistic theories, LFG (see Kaplan and Bresnan (1982 treats grammatical relations as first class citizens.  Accordingly, it casts its linguistic analyses in terms of a composite ontology: two independent domains a domain of constituency information (c-structure and a domain of grammatical function information (f-structure) linked together in a mutually constraining manner.  As has been amply demonstrated over the last fifteen years, this view permits perspicuous analyses of a wide variety of linguistic data.  However standard formalisations of LFG do not capture its strikingly simple underlying intuitions.  Instead, they make a detour via the LFG construction algorithm, which explains how equational constraints linking subtrees and feature structures are to be resolved.  The main point of the present paper is to show that such detours are unnecessary.  Firstly we define .
