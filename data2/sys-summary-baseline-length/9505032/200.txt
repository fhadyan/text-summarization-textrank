 We present a new model of natural language based on the concept of construction, consisting of a set of features of form, a set of semantic and pragmatic conditions describing its application context, and a description of its meaning.  The model gives us a better handle on phenomena of real language than the standard approaches, such as syntax + semantics a la Montague.  It is also an alternative to the standard design based on the pipeline syntax-semantics-pragmatics (we have little to say about morphology at this point   Since this work has been implemented, there is also a computational argument in favor of this approach.  We claim that a linking of form, meaning and context is needed to accurately describe NL constructions, both "standard" and "non-standard   However, we are not arguing for the unsuitability of syntax for describing a "core" of language or a universal grammar.  We believe, that such a language core is small, and that the syntactic descriptions of this core are naturally paired with their meanings, which produces a construction-based universal grammar.  xdiary.
