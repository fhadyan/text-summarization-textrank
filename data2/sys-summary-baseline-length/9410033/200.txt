 Natural Language Generation, i.e the process of building an adequate utterance for some given content, is by nature a decision-making problem (Appelt, 1985   Internal decisions are made on the basis of the specified input.  Unfortunately, input information can be insufficient in two respects: If the input structure for generation is provided by another AI-system, global problems in producing sufficient input information for the generator may occur, e.g because of translation mismatches in machine translation (Kameyama, 1991   In this case, the generator either has to use a default or formulate a request for clarification in order to be able to continue its processing, i.e to produce an utterance.  During simultaneous interpretation requests are rather unusual.  Here defaults allow for a standalone handling of the problem.  For example, problems during speech recognition of automatic interpretation can lead to results like the (man/men) will come to the hotel tomorrow   Furthermore, for incremental generation, the input information is produced and handed over step by step, so that it can be temporarily incomplete although as a whole it may become sufficient.
