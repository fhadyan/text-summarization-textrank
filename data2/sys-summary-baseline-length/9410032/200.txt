 This paper presents a text planner for the verbalization of natural deduction (ND) style proofs .  Several similar attempts can be found in previous work.  Developed before the era of NL generation, the system EXPOUND of D.  Chester can be characterized as an example of direct translation: Although a sophisticated linearization is applied on the input ND proofs, the steps are then translated locally in a template driven way.  ND proofs were tested as input to an early version of the MUMBLE system of D.  McDonald , the main aim however, was to show the feasibility of the architecture.  A more recent attempt can be found in THINKER , which implements several interesting but isolated proof presentation strategies, without giving a comprehensive underlying model.  Our computational model can therefore be viewed as the first serious attempt at a comprehensive computational model that produces adequate argumentative texts from ND style proofs.  The main aim is to show how existing text planning techniques can be adapted for this particular application.  To test its feasibility, this computational model is implemented in a system called PROVERB.
