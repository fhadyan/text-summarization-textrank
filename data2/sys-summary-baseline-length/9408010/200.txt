 The constraint a predicate imposes on its arguments is called selectional restriction.  For example, in the sentence fragment She eats x the verb eat imposes a constraint on the direct object x x should be something that is usually being eaten.  This phenomenon has received considerable attention in the linguistic community and it was recently explained in statistical terms in .  Because it restricts subsequent nouns and because nouns account for a large part of the perplexity (see it seems natural to try to use selectional restriction in a language model for speech recognition.  In this paper, we report on our work in progress on this topic.  We begin by presenting in section the process we use to obtain training and testing data from unrestricted English text.  The data constitutes the input to a clustering algorithm and a language model, both of which are described in section .  In section , we present the results we have obtained so far, followed by conclusions in section .  The finite-state automaton we use only has three states and it is shown in Figure .
