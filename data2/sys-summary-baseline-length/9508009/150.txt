 A current trend in logic is to attempt to incorporate semantic information into the domain of deduction, , .  An area for which this strategy is particularly useful is the problem of categorial grammar parsing.  The categorial grammar research programme requires the use of a range of logical calculi for linguistic description.  Some researchers have considered labelled deduction as a tool for implementing categorial parsers , , and this paper can be seen as a new contribution to this field.  In this paper we aim for a modular approach, in which the basic grammar is kept constant, while different calculi can be implemented and experimented with by constraining the derivations produced by the theorem prover.  The system is based on labelled analytic deduction, particularly on the LKE method, developed by D'Agostino and Gabbay .  right dislocation,
