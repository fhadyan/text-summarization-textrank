 Over the last few years there has been a growing interest in computational morphology and phonology.  A number of systems have been developed that deal with word-level processing.  A widely used approach is finite-state morphology, most notably two-level morphology (for an introduction, see   Morphological components are successfully used for a wide range of stand-alone applications like spelling correction and hyphenation.  One obvious application is the use in NLP systems geared to the analysis/generation of text.  Surprisingly, they have not been widely applied in this domain up to now.  A major reason for this is the problem of interfacing morphology with syntax.  Reflecting the current trend in syntax towards lexicalism, unification-based systems use highly structured feature structures as input.  Translating the output of morphological components into such a representation has proved to be difficult.  below
