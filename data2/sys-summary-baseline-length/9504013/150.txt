 There are thousands, if not millions, of application programs in everyday use that automatically generate texts; but probably fewer than ten of these programs use the linguistic and knowledge-based techniques that have been studied by the Natural-Language Generation (NLG) community.  The other 99.9% of systems use programs that simply manipulate character strings, in a way that uses little, if any, linguistic knowledge.  For lack of a better name, I will call this the `template' approach.  In this paper, I will use the term automatic text generation (ATG) to refer to any computer program that automatically produces texts from some input data, regardless of whether NLG or template technology is used internally.  wins, or try vs.  tries) depending on whether a numeric parameter is one or not.
