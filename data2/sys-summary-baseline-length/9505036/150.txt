 This paper concerns how to generate and understand discourse anaphoric noun phrases, or noun phrases (NPs) that evoke a discourse entity already in the discourse model (Webber webber78   Dale dale89 dale92 implements Gricean constraints on informativeness for generating discourse anaphoric NPs.  However, his model follows the tradition of assuming that distinct constraints govern pronouns versus phrasal NPs (cf.  Centering gjw83 kameyama85, a model of local attentional state sidner79, has been applied primarily to definite pronouns.  I argue that Gricean constraints should be applied equally to discourse anaphoric pronouns and phrasal NPs, and that integrating centering and informational constraints covers a broader range of cases.  In , I present an analysis of all discourse anaphoric NPs (N=1,233) in a corpus of ten narratives showing that semantic explicitness depends largely on informational constraints.
