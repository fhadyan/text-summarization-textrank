 One source of unnaturalness in the output of many text-to-speech systems stems from the involvement of algorithmically generated default intonation contours, applied under minimal control from syntax and semantics.  The intelligibility of the speech produced by these systems is a tribute to both the resilience of human language understanding and the ingenuity of the algorithms' inventors.  It has often been noted, however, that the results frequently sound unnatural when taken in context, and may on occasion mislead the hearer.  It is for this reason that a number of discourse-model-based speech generation systems have been proposed, in which intonation contour is determined from context or the model.  Work in this area includes an early study by Young and Fallside and studies by Terken Houghton Isard and Pearson Davis and Hirschberg Hirschberg and Zacharski et al.  Steedman [   Example .
