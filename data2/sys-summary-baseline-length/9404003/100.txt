 The formalism of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars , a variant of standard tree-adjoining grammars (TAG was intended to allow the use of TAGs for language transduction in addition to language specification.  Synchronous TAGs specify relations between language pairs; each language is specified with a standard TAG, and the pairing between strings in the separate languages is specified by synchronizing the two TAGs through linking pairs of elementary trees.  This paper concerns the formal definitions underlying synchronous tree-adjoining grammars.  This sort of rewriting definition of derivation is problematic for several reasons.
