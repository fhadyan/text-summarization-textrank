 In computational theories of discourse, there are at least three processes presumed to operate under a LIMITED ATTENTION CONSTRAINT of some type: (1) ellipsis interpretation; (2) pronominal anaphora interpretation; and (3) inference of discourse relations between representations A and B of utterances in a discourse, e.g.  B MOTIVATES A.  In each case, the interpretation of the current element B of a discourse depends on the accessibility of another earlier element A.  According to the LIMITED ATTENTION CONSTRAINT only a limited number of candidates need to be considered in the processing of B, e.g.  only a limited number of entities in the discourse model are potential cospecifiers for a pronoun.  The limited attention constraint has been defined by some researchers by LINEAR RECENCY: a representation of an utterance A is LINEARLY RECENT for a representation of an utterance B if A is linearly adjacent to B.  In contrast, other work has formulated the limited attention constraint in terms of HIERARCHICAL RECENCY , , inter alia.  This focus space supports the interpretation of the proforms in A-8a.
