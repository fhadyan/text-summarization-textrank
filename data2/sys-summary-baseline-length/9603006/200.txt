 Collocations present an area that is important both for lexicography to improve their coverage in modern dictionaries as well as for lexical acquisition in computational linguistics, where the goal is to build either large reusable lexical databases (LDBs) or specific lexica for specialized NLP-applications.  We have tested a statistical approach using Mutual Information (MI) and t-score, introduced into linguistics by Church and Hanks (1989) and Church et al.  (1991 for the (semi automatic extraction of verb-noun (V-N) collocations from untagged German text corpora.  At the time when this study was carried out in early 1993, no POS-tagged German corpora were available.  In the meantime this has changed, even work on shallow parsers for German is in progress (Abney, University of Tbingen   Nevertheless it is interesting to answer the question how much can be done with an untagged corpus and what might be gained by lemmatizing, POS-tagging or shallow parsing.  Collocations in the sense of `frequently cooccurring words' can quite easily be extracted from corpora by statistic means.  significant collocations.  Brundage et al.  1983
