 Many have argued that discourse has a global structure above the level of individual utterances, and that linguistic phenomena like prosody, cue phrases, and nominal reference are partly conditioned by and reflect this structure (cf.  However, an obstacle to exploiting the relation between global structure and linguistic devices in natural language systems is that there is too little data about how they constrain one another.  We have been engaged in a study addressing this gap.  In previous work , we reported on a method for empirically validating global discourse units, and on our evaluation of algorithms to identify these units.  We found significant agreement among naive subjects on a discourse segmentation task, which suggests that global discourse units have some objective reality.  In section , we discuss how linguistic features are coded and describe our evaluation.
