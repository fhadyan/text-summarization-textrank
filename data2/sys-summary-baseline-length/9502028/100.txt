 A robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) system must be able to process sentences that contain words unknown to its lexicon.  The syntactic and semantic properties of unknown words are derived from those of known words in a sentence, assuming that the given sentence is valid.  The underlying linguistic framework plays a critical role in lexical acquisition.  Linguistic frameworks can be broadly classified into two groups: those with phrase structure rules and those without.  In general, the more complex the phrase structure rules, the larger the search space.
