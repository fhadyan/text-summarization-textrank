 A robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) system must be able to process sentences that contain words unknown to its lexicon.  The syntactic and semantic properties of unknown words are derived from those of known words in a sentence, assuming that the given sentence is valid.  The underlying linguistic framework plays a critical role in lexical acquisition.  Linguistic frameworks can be broadly classified into two groups: those with phrase structure rules and those without.  The lexicon of known words and any phrase structure rules that exist determine the size of the search space for the classification of unknown words.  In general, the more complex the phrase structure rules, the larger the search space.  This paper explores lexical acquisition in a framework without phrase structure rules.  All constraints on the usage of words are integrated into the lexicon.  We use a novel lexical representation that explicitly specifies what syntactic and semantic classes of words may appear to the left and to the right of a word in a valid sentence.  Otherwise, constraints are inferred for unknown words that will make the sentence valid.
