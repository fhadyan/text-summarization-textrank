 In this paper, we argue that Higher-Order Unification (HOU) provides a linguistically adequate tool for modeling the semantics of focus.  Building up on , we develop a unification-based analysis of focus which we show favourably compares with two prominent theories of focus, Rooth's Alternative Semantics and Krifka's Structured Meanings theory.  For data which is generally viewed as a test-bed for focus theory (utterances with multiple focus operators and second occurrence expressions we show that contrary to Rooth's and Krifka's theories, the HOU treatment yields a transparent analysis while avoiding under- and over-generation.  Focus is a much debated notion.  In this paper, we assume a simplified version of Jackendoff's definition: a focus is the semantic value of a prosodically prominent element.  We take the identification of prosodically prominent elements as given.  To set the stage for this paper, we will briefly review the folklore, i.e.  the main issues of focus theory.  It is commonly agreed that focus triggers the formation of an additional semantic value which we will call the Focus Semantic Value (FSV   Peter.
