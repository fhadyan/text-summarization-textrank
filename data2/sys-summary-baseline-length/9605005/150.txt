 In this paper, we argue that Higher-Order Unification (HOU) provides a linguistically adequate tool for modeling the semantics of focus.  Building up on , we develop a unification-based analysis of focus which we show favourably compares with two prominent theories of focus, Rooth's Alternative Semantics and Krifka's Structured Meanings theory.  For data which is generally viewed as a test-bed for focus theory (utterances with multiple focus operators and second occurrence expressions we show that contrary to Rooth's and Krifka's theories, the HOU treatment yields a transparent analysis while avoiding under- and over-generation.  Focus is a much debated notion.  In this paper, we assume a simplified version of Jackendoff's definition: a focus is the semantic value of a prosodically prominent element.  We take the identification of prosodically prominent elements as given.
