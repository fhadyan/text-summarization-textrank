 We present an argument for a particular model for natural language, namely construction grammars (cf.  and , for a comprehensive introduction, and , , , , , for computational models   The result we report establishes their optimality, in the sense of the minimum description length (MDL) principle (a formal version of the Ockham Razor   The argument consists in using linguistic and computational evidence in setting up a formal model, and then using the MDL principle to prove its superiority with respect to alternative models.  The result is significant for our understanding of the relationship between syntax and semantics, and consequently for choosing NLP architectures.  For instance, whether the processing should proceed in a pipeline from syntax to semantics to pragmatics, and whether all linguistic information should be combined in a set of constraints.  From a broader perspective, this paper does not only argue for a certain model of processing, but also provides a methodology for determining advantages of different approaches to NLP.  After discussing the terminology, we begin our exposition with a sketch of the argument (Section 1.2
