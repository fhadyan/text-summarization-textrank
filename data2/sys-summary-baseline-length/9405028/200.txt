 Our aim is to formalize constraints that are needed to develop a parser based on unification grammar (called UG henceforth) so that our parser can deal with variety of types of sentences in Japanese.  However just parsing syntactically is not enough for natural language understanding.  One important and necessary task to be done, when a parser processes a discourse in Japanese, is the so called zero anaphora resolution.  All of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic constraints are to be involved to resolve zero anaphora.  Of course, some of omitted pronouns are syntactically resolved.  For instance, VP with suffix te is not regarded as a clause but a conjunct VP.  Therefore the subject of the VP with te, which is possibly omitted from surface, should corefer with the subject of the sentence.  One example is `Hanako felt cold and closed the window where both of zero subjects and refer to the sentential topic Hanako .  In this example, one of the possible accounts for this interpretation is the following.  However, in complex sentences, things are quite different.  Table.
