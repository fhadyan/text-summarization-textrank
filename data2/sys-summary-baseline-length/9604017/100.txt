 Suppose that we have a general grammar for English, or some other natural language; by this, we mean a grammar which encodes most of the important constructions in the language, and which is intended to be applicable to a large range of different domains and applications.  By the very nature of its construction, a general grammar allows a great many theoretically valid analyses of almost any non-trivial sentence.  The work reported here is a logical continuation of two specific strands of research aimed in this general direction.  , , .
