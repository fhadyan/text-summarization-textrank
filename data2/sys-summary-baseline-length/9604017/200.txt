 Suppose that we have a general grammar for English, or some other natural language; by this, we mean a grammar which encodes most of the important constructions in the language, and which is intended to be applicable to a large range of different domains and applications.  The basic question attacked in this paper is the following one: can such a grammar be concretely useful if we want to process input from a specific domain? In particular, how can a parser that uses a general grammar achieve a level of efficiency that is practically acceptable? The central problem is simple to state.  By the very nature of its construction, a general grammar allows a great many theoretically valid analyses of almost any non-trivial sentence.  However, in the context of a specific domain, most of these will be extremely implausible, and can in practice be ignored.  If we want efficient parsing, we want to be able to focus our search on only a small portion of the space of theoretically valid grammatical analyses.  , , .
