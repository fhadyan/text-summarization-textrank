 The resource-based approach to semantic composition in Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) obtains the interpretation for a phrase via a logical deduction, beginning with the interpretations of its parts as premises .  The resource-sensitive system of linear logic is used to compute meanings in accordance with relationships manifest in LFG f-structures.  The properties of the system ensure that meanings are used exactly once, allowing coherence and completeness conditions on f-structures to be maintained.  This is most obvious in, but is not limited to, sentences involving coordination.  Dalrymple et al.
