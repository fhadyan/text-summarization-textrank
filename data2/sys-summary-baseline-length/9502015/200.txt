 The resource-based approach to semantic composition in Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) obtains the interpretation for a phrase via a logical deduction, beginning with the interpretations of its parts as premises .  The resource-sensitive system of linear logic is used to compute meanings in accordance with relationships manifest in LFG f-structures.  The properties of the system ensure that meanings are used exactly once, allowing coherence and completeness conditions on f-structures to be maintained.  However, there are cases where a single constituent appears to yield more than one contribution to the meaning of an utterance.  This is most obvious in, but is not limited to, sentences involving coordination.  In example ( for instance, NAFTA is the object of two different verbs: Bill supported, and Hillary opposed, NAFTA.  Since the hallmark of the linear logic approach is to ensure that f-structure contributions are utilized exactly once in a derivation, such constructions would at first glance appear to be problematic for the approach.  We refine our previous analysis to account for cases where an f-structure is reached by multiple paths from an enclosing f-structure.
