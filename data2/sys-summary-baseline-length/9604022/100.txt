 Words unknown to the lexicon present a substantial problem to part-of-speech ( POS) tagging of real-world texts.  Taggers assign a single POS-tag to a word-token, provided that it is known what parts-of-speech this word can take on in principle.  So, first words are looked up in the lexicon.  However, 3 to 5% of word tokens are usually missing in the lexicon when tagging real-world texts.  This is where word- POS guessers take their place they employ the analysis of word features, e.g.  the lexicon.
