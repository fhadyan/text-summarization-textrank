 Internally, a sentence is a sequence of discrete elements drawn from a finite vocabulary.  Spoken, it becomes a continuous signal- a series of rapid pressure changes in the local atmosphere with few obvious divisions.  How can a pre-linguistic child, or a computer, acquire the skills necessary to reconstruct the original sentence? Specifically, how can it learn the vocabulary of its language given access only to highly variable, continuous speech signals? We answer this question, describing an algorithm that produces a linguistically meaningful lexicon from a raw speech stream.  Of course, it is not the first answer to how an utterance can be segmented and classified given a fixed vocabulary, but in this work we are specifically concerned with the unsupervised acquisition of a lexicon, given no prior language-specific knowledge.  In contrast to several prior proposals, our algorithm makes no assumptions about the presence of facilitative side information, or of cleanly spoken and segmented speech, or about the distribution of sounds within words.  It is instead based on optimal coding in a minimum description length (MDL) framework.
