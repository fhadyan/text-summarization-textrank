 In conversation, a person sometimes has to refer to an object that is not previously known to the other participant.  One particular situation in which this arises is in giving directions.  For example: A B funny Go straight ahead until you get to a funny-looking building.  The hearer has to understand the reference well enough that when he later reaches the building, he will recognize it as the intended referent.  A reference of this sort is often achieved through a collaboration between the conversants.  In such cases, the speaker has the goal of having the hearer know how to identify an object.  The speaker attempts to achieve this goal by building a description of the object that she believes will give the hearer the ability to identify it when it is possible to do so.  Okay.
