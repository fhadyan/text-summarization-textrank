 In conversation, a person sometimes has to refer to an object that is not previously known to the other participant.  One particular situation in which this arises is in giving directions.  For example: A B funny Go straight ahead until you get to a funny-looking building.  The hearer has to understand the reference well enough that when he later reaches the building, he will recognize it as the intended referent.  A reference of this sort is often achieved through a collaboration between the conversants.  Okay.
