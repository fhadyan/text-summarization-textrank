 Hidden Markov Models are commonly used for statistical language models, e.g.  in part-of-speech tagging and speech recognition .  The models need a large set of parameters which are induced from a (text corpus.  The parameters should be optimal in the sense that the resulting models assign high probabilities to seen training data as well as new data that arises in an application.  There are several methods to estimate model parameters.  This method is commonly used in speech recognition and known as word-bigram or word-trigram model.  Words are automatically grouped, e.g.
