 Hidden Markov Models are commonly used for statistical language models, e.g.  in part-of-speech tagging and speech recognition .  The models need a large set of parameters which are induced from a (text corpus.  The parameters should be optimal in the sense that the resulting models assign high probabilities to seen training data as well as new data that arises in an application.  There are several methods to estimate model parameters.  The first one is to use each word (type) as a state and estimate the transition probabilities between two or three words by using the relative frequencies of a corpus.  This method is commonly used in speech recognition and known as word-bigram or word-trigram model.  The relative frequencies have to be smoothed to handle the sparse data problem and to avoid zero probabilities.  The second method is a variation of the first method.  Words are automatically grouped, e.g.  by similarity of distribution in the corpus .  The third method uses manually defined categories.  They are linguistically motivated and usually called parts-of-speech.  This method is commonly used for part-of-speech tagging .  1,440
