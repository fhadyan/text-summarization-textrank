 Lexicalist approaches to MT, particularly those incorporating the technique of Shake-and-Bake generation , combine the linguistic advantages of transfer , and interlingual , approaches.  Unfortunately, the generation algorithms described to date have been intractable.  In this paper, we describe an alternative generation component which has polynomial time complexity.  Shake-and-Bake translation assumes a source grammar, a target grammar and a bilingual dictionary which relates translationally equivalent sets of lexical signs, carrying across the semantic dependencies established by the source language analysis stage into the target language generation stage.  The translation process consists of three phases: 1.  A parsing phase, which outputs a multiset, or bag, of source language signs instantiated with sufficiently rich linguistic information established by the parse to ensure adequate translations.  A lexical-semantic transfer phase which employs the bilingual dictionary to map the bag of instantiated source signs onto a bag of target language signs.  A generation phase which imposes an order on the bag of target signs which is guaranteed grammatical according to the monolingual target grammar.  If they are well-formed, the system halts indicating success.
