 In the approach to discourse structure developed in and , a discourse exhibits both global and local coherence.  On this view, a key element of local coherence is centering, a system of rules and constraints that govern the relationship between what the discourse is about and some of the linguistic choices made by the discourse participants, e.g.  choice of grammatical function, syntactic structure, and type of referring expression (proper noun, definite or indefinite description, reflexive or personal pronoun, etc   Pronominalization in particular serves to focus attention on what is being talked about; inappropriate use or failure to use pronouns causes communication to be less fluent.  For instance, it takes longer for hearers to process a pronominalized noun phrase that is not in focus than one that is, while it takes longer to process a non-pronominalized noun phrase that is in focus than one that is not .  The centering model is based on the following assumptions.  A discourse segment consists of a sequence of utterances .  There are several distinct types of transitions from one utterance to the next.  See figure .
