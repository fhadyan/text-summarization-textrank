 In natural language processing filtering is used to weed out those search paths that are redundant, i.e are not going to be used in the proof tree corresponding to the natural language expression to be generated or parsed.  Filter optimization often comprises an extension of a specific processing strategy such that it exploits specific knowledge about grammars and/or the computational task(s) that one is using them for.  At the same time it often remains unclear how these optimizations relate to each other and what they actually mean.  (1992   (1996
