 Several methods have been proposed to deal with anaphora resolution and prepositional phrase (PP) attachment phenomenon and separately, so that the literature is very abundant : for PPs see e.g (Frazier and Fodor, 1979; Hobbs, 1990; Wilks and Huang, 1985 and for anaphora see e.g (Carter, 1986; Reinhart, 1983; Sidner, 1983   However none of these methods has considered the way of dealing both phenomena in the same concrete system.  We propose in this paper an algorithm that deals with both phenomena, in the same analyser.  The anaphora module pertains to the recent methods, uses a set of resolution rules based on the focusing approach, see (Sidner, 1983   These rules are applied to the conceptual representation and their output is a set of candidate antecedents.
