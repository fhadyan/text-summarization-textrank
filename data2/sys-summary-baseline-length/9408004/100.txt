 Both principle-based parsing and probabilistic methods for the analysis of natural language have become popular in the last decade.  While the former borrows from advanced linguistic specifications of syntax, the latter has been more concerned with extracting distributional regularities from language to aid the implementation of NLP systems and the analysis of corpora.  This paper falls directly between these approaches, using statistical information derived from corpora analysis to weight syntactic analyses produced by a `principles and parameters' parser.  A sketch of the organisation of GB (the `T-model is shown in figure .
