 Both principle-based parsing and probabilistic methods for the analysis of natural language have become popular in the last decade.  While the former borrows from advanced linguistic specifications of syntax, the latter has been more concerned with extracting distributional regularities from language to aid the implementation of NLP systems and the analysis of corpora.
