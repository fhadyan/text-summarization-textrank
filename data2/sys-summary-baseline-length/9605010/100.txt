 Current work in surface realization concentrates on the use of general, abstract algorithms that interpret declaratively defined, non-directional grammars.  It is claimed that this way, a grammar can be reused for parsing and generation, or a generator can interpret different grammars (e.g.  in machine translation   A prominent example for this type of abstract algorithm is semantic-head-driven generation [ ] that has been used with HPSG, CUG, DCG and several other formalisms.  In practice, this type of surface realization has several drawbacks.  Figure   Section   informal wordings.
