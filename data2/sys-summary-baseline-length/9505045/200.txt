 During the last five years, people have started to believe there is a serious possibility of building practically useful spoken language translators for limited domains.  There are now a number of high-profile projects with large budgets, the most well-known being the German Verbmobil effort.  At the moment, the best systems are at the level of advanced prototypes; making projections from current performance, it seems reasonable to hope that these could be developed into commercially interesting systems within a time-scale of five to ten more years.  This paper will describe work carried out on one such advanced prototype, the Spoken Language Translator (SLT) system , .  SLT can translate spoken English utterances from the domain of air travel planning (ATIS; ) into spoken Swedish or French, using a vocabulary of about 1200 stem entries.  The Swedish version has been operational since June 1993, and has been publicly demonstrated on numerous occasions.  The French version became operational fairly recently; the language-processing component was demoed for the first time at the CeBIT trade fair at Hannover in March 1995.
