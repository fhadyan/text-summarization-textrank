 During the last five years, people have started to believe there is a serious possibility of building practically useful spoken language translators for limited domains.  There are now a number of high-profile projects with large budgets, the most well-known being the German Verbmobil effort.  At the moment, the best systems are at the level of advanced prototypes; making projections from current performance, it seems reasonable to hope that these could be developed into commercially interesting systems within a time-scale of five to ten more years.  Similar considerations apply to prepositions.
