 This paper describes the adaptation work carried out to retarget the Xerox Tagger to Spanish.  The Xerox Tagger HREF 9505035.html#Cutting92 gt;Cutting et al 1992] has as one of its virtues the characteristic of being based on a simple probabilistic model, as it will become clear below.  It is also claimed to be language-independent and it is public domain.  Various authors have already developed ports to languages other than English (the language in which development was performed   Thus, presents the issue of adapting the tagger to German, while report on French.  These ports have been performed at the same time to that presented here for Spanish.  The interest on the Xerox Tagger not only comes from the virtues already mentioned, but also benefits from the attraction that stochastic approaches to Natural Language Processing have revived in the researchers on the field.  Widely commented examples of this resurgence of probabilistic techniques include the double special issue that Computational Linguistics devoted recently to this venture.  In this case, the combination is performed by means of separate modules.  continuous invariant multi-word units
