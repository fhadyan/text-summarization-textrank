 Determining the referential property of noun phrases is essential not only to understanding a text, but also to decide how to generate it in English.  This paper proposes a heuristic algorithm to determine the referential properties of noun phrases in a Japanese text.  The original motivation of the research was to improve the quality of English output by NTT Communication Science Laboratories' Japanese to English machine translation system ALT-J/E , .  We expect, however, that the results will also be useful for text extraction and general text understanding.  In this paper we use the term noun phrase reference to describe the relation between a noun phrase and what it stands for when it is used.  We distinguish between three uses of noun phrases, two referential and one non-referential.

This paper is structured as follows.  Noun phrase reference is of fundamental importance in any discussion of meaning .
