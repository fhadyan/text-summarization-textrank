 Arguments for stacked X-bar structures (such as immediately dominating with the same head) are arguments against dependency grammar as normally understood.  This paper reviews the dependency grammar formalism, presents evidence that stacked structures are required, and then proposes a reinterpretation of dependency grammar to make it compatible with the evidence.  Dependency grammar (DG) describes syntactic structure in terms of links between individual words rather than constituency trees.  DG has its roots in Arabic and Latin traditional grammar; its modern advocates include Tesnire ( Robinson ( Starosta ( Mel'cuk ( Hudson ( and myself (   The fundamental relation in DG is between head and dependent.
