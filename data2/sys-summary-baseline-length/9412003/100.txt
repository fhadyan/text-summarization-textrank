 It is well known that statistical language models often suffer from a lack of training data.  This is true for standard tasks and even more so when one tries to build a language model for a new domain, because a large corpus of texts from that domain is usually not available.  One frequently used approach to alleviate this problem is to construct a clustered language model.  Because it has fewer parameters, it needs less training data.  less complex model, can be of considerable importance.  Its main idea is as follows.
