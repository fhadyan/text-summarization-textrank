 The position taken in this paper can be summarised as follows.  Grice's maxims [Grice 1975] are framed as directives to the speaker, and so it is natural to consider how they might impact on the task of natural language generation ( NLG   A number of the maxims can collectively be expressed by the imperative Don't say too much and don't say too little This focusses our attention on the language generation subtask of CONTENT DETERMINATION; and one of the more constrained and well-explored aspects of content determination is the generation of referring expressions.  However, if we look at this task in detail, it becomes clear that there are problems with enforcing a literal interpretation of the maxims.  A MINIMAL DISTINGUISHING DESCRIPTION is then the linguistic realisation of the smallest such set of properties.  Be relevant.
