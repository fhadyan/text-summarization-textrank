 In collaborative consultation dialogues, the consultant and the executing agent collaborate on developing a plan to achieve the executing agent's domain goal.  Since agents are autonomous and heterogeneous, it is inevitable that conflicts in their beliefs arise during the planning process.  In such cases, collaborative agents should attempt to square away the conflicts by engaging in collaborative negotiation to determine what should constitute their shared plan of actions and shared beliefs.  This paper presents a model for engaging in collaborative negotiation to resolve conflicts in agents' beliefs about domain knowledge.
