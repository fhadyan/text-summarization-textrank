 Part-of-speech ( POS) taggers are programs which assign a single POS -tag to a word-token, provided that it is known what parts-of-speech this word can take on in principle.  In order to do that taggers are supplied with a lexicon that lists possible POS-tags for words which were seen at the training phase.  Naturally, when tagging real-word texts, one can expect to encounter words which were not seen at the training phase and hence not included into the lexicon.  This is where word- POS guessers take their place - they employ the analysis of word features, e.g.  word leading and trailing characters to figure out its possible POS categories.  Currently, most of the taggers are supplied with a word-guessing component for dealing with unknown words.  In a cascading word- POS guesser is described.
