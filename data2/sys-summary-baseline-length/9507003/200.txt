 The notion of robustness in natural language processing is a rather broad one and lacks a precise definition.  Usually, it is taken to describe a kind of monotonic behaviour, which should be guaranteed whenever a system is exposed to some sort of non-standard input data: A comparatively small deviation from a predefined ideal should lead to no or only minor disturbances in the system's response, whereas a total failure might only be accepted for sufficiently distorted input.  Under this informal notion robustness may well be interpreted as a system's indifference to a wide range of external disruptive factors including the inherent uncertainty of real world input, e.g.  speech or hand writing, noisy environments, the variance between speakers, for instance idiolectal, dialectal or sociolectal, erroneous input with respect to some normative standard, an insufficient competence of the processing system, if e.g.  exposed to a non-native language or new terminology, highly varying speech rates and resource limitations due to the parallel execution of several mental activities.  Special signal enhancement techniques are used to suppress stationary environmental noise.  information decrease.
