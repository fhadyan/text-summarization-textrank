 Unification-based grammar formalisms can be viewed as generalizations of Context-Free Grammars (CFG) where the nonterminal symbols are replaced by an infinite domain of feature structures.  Much of their popularity stems from the way in which syntactic generalization may be elegantly stated by means of constraints amongst features and their values.  Unfortunately, the expressivity of these formalisms can have undesirable consequences for their processing.  In naive implementations of unification grammar parsers, feature structures play the same role as nonterminals in standard context-free grammar parsers.  Potentially large feature structures are stored at intermediate steps in the computation, so that the space requirements of the algorithm are expensive.  Furthermore, the need to perform non-destructive unification means that a large proportion of the processing time is spent copying feature structures.  One approach to this problem is to refine parsing algorithms by developing techniques such as restrictions, structure-sharing, and lazy unification that reduce the amount of structure that is stored and hence the need for copying of features structures , , , , , , , , ,   We refer to this extension as Partially Linear Indexed Grammars (plig
