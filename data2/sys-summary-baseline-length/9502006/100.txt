 The paradigm of two-level morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983) has become popular for handling word formation phenomena in a variety of languages.  The original formulation has been extended to allow morphotactic constraints to be expressed by feature specification (Trost, 1990; Alshawi et al, 1991) rather than Koskenniemi's less perspicuous device of continuation classes.  Methods for the automatic compilation of rules from a notation convenient for the rule-writer into finite-state automata have also been developed, allowing the efficient analysis and synthesis of word forms.  appeler, call becomes appellera
