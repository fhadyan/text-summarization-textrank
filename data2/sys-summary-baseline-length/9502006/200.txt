 The paradigm of two-level morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983) has become popular for handling word formation phenomena in a variety of languages.  The original formulation has been extended to allow morphotactic constraints to be expressed by feature specification (Trost, 1990; Alshawi et al, 1991) rather than Koskenniemi's less perspicuous device of continuation classes.  Methods for the automatic compilation of rules from a notation convenient for the rule-writer into finite-state automata have also been developed, allowing the efficient analysis and synthesis of word forms.  The automata may be derived from the rules alone (Trost, 1990 or involve composition with the lexicon (Karttunen, Kaplan and Zaenen, 1992   However, there is often a trade-off between run-time efficiency and factors important for rapid and accurate system development, such as perspicuity of notation, ease of debugging, speed of compilation and the size of its output, and the independence of the morphological and lexical components.  Many European languages are of the inflecting type, and occupy still another region of the space of difficulty.  We therefore take the following approach.
