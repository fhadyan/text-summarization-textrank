 Generative grammar and formal language theory share a common origin in a procedural notion of grammars: the grammar formalism provides a general mechanism for recognizing or generating languages while the grammar itself specializes that mechanism for a specific language.  At least initially there was hope that this relationship would be informative for linguistics, that by characterizing the natural languages in terms of language-theoretic complexity one would gain insight into the structural regularities of those languages.  Moreover, the fact that language-theoretic complexity classes have dual automata-theoretic characterizations offered the prospect that such results might provide abstract models of the human language faculty, thereby not just identifying these regularities, but actually accounting for them.  Over time, the two disciplines have gradually become estranged, principally due to a realization that the structural properties of languages that characterize natural languages may well not be those that can be distinguished by existing language-theoretic complexity classes.  Thus the insights offered by formal language theory might actually be misleading in guiding theories of syntax.  A grammatical theory expressed within such a framework is just the set of logical consequences of those axioms.
