 Generative grammar and formal language theory share a common origin in a procedural notion of grammars: the grammar formalism provides a general mechanism for recognizing or generating languages while the grammar itself specializes that mechanism for a specific language.  At least initially there was hope that this relationship would be informative for linguistics, that by characterizing the natural languages in terms of language-theoretic complexity one would gain insight into the structural regularities of those languages.  Thus the insights offered by formal language theory might actually be misleading in guiding theories of syntax.
