 Psycholinguistic knowledge would be greatly helpful, as we believe, in constructing an artificial language processing system.  As for machine translation, we should take advantage of our understandings of (1) how the languages are represented in human mind; (2) how the representation is mapped from one language to another; (3) how the representation and mapping are acquired by human.  The bilingual dual-coding theory partially answers the above questions.  It provides a learnable lexical selection sub-system for a connectionist transfer project in machine translation.
