 Psycholinguistic knowledge would be greatly helpful, as we believe, in constructing an artificial language processing system.  As for machine translation, we should take advantage of our understandings of (1) how the languages are represented in human mind; (2) how the representation is mapped from one language to another; (3) how the representation and mapping are acquired by human.  The bilingual dual-coding theory partially answers the above questions.  It depicts the verbal representations for two different languages as two separate but connected logogen systems, characterizes the translation process as the activation along the connections between the logogen systems, and attributes the acquisition of the representation to some unspecified statistical processes.  We have explored an information theoretical neural network that can acquire the verbal associations in the dual-coding theory.  It provides a learnable lexical selection sub-system for a connectionist transfer project in machine translation.  Studies on cross-language transfer and cross-language priming have provided evidence for both hypotheses , .  Dual-coding theory explains the coexistence of independent and interdependent phenomena with separate but connected structures.  This approach is learnable.
