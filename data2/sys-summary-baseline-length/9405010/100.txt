 Ellipsis is pervasive in natural language, and hence has received much attention within both computational and theoretical linguistics.  However, the conditions under which a representation of an utterance may serve as a suitable basis for interpreting subsequent elliptical forms remain poorly understood; specifically, past attempts to characterize these processes within a single traditional module of language processing (e.g considering either syntax, semantics, or discourse in isolation) have failed to account for all of the data.
