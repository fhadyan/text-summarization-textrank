 The successful treatment of morphological phenomena in some languages by means of finite state automata appears to have led to the idea that this model is the most efficient and universal way to deal with morphology computationally.  Although there exist good finite-state processors for Spanish -like , or - we think that some phenomena can be handled more elegantly using a context-free approach, particularly if the morphological component is to be included as a part of a syntax grammar.  Experience has shown that it is not easy for any approach.  (to love   crisis.
