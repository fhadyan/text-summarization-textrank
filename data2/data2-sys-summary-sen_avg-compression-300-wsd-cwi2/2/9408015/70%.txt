 Figure shows the choices for the effect of invalid steps for the Design-World task The Zero-Nonmatching-Beliefs task is designed to investigate the effect of the level of agreement that agents must achieve In section we defined an objective performance measure for the DESIGN-HOUSE plan for each task variation01 respectively, and the parameters that are varied are (1) communication strategy; (2) task definition; and (3) AWM settings Strategies may be neither BENEFICIAL or DETRIMENTAL, since there may be no difference between two strategies In the comparisons below, strategy 1 is either Close-Consequence or Explicit-Warrant and strategy 2 is the All-Implicit strategy Differences in performance between two strategies are plotted on the Y-axis against AWM parameter settings on the X-axis Every simulation run varies the AWM radius from 1 to 16 to test whether a strategy only has an effect at particular AWM settings In the reminder of this section, we first compare within strategy, for each task definition and show that whether or not a strategy is beneficial depends on the task Then we compare across strategies for a particular task, showing that the interaction of the strategy and task varies according to the strategy19, p [  In contrast, if the task is the fault-intolerant Zero-Invalids task, then the Close-Consequence strategy is BENEFICIAL19, p [ 3, p [  This is because IRUs displace other facts from AWM Figure shows that Explicit-Warrant is beneficial in the Standard task at AWM values of 3 and above Here, the scores improve because the beliefs necessary for deliberating the proposal are made available in the current context with each proposal (KS for AWM of 3 and above ] 23, p [ 01 so that agents don't have to search memory for them23 for AWM from 2 to 11, p [  This is due to agents' resource limits, which means that retrieval is indeterminate and that there are costs associated with retrieving warrants from memory At high AWM the differences between the two strategies are small Design-World was inspired by the TileWorld simulation environment: a rapidly changing robot world in which an artificial agent attempts to optimize reasoning and planning ,  Design-World uses similar methods to test a theory of the effect of resource limits on communicative behavior between two agents The communicative acts and discourse acts used by Design-World agents are similar to those used in , , ,  Design-World is also based on the method used in Carletta's JAM simulation for the Edinburgh Map-Task  Given good error recovery strategies, Carletta argues that `high risk' strategies are more efficient, where efficiency is a measure of the number of utterances in the dialogue We showed that strategies that are inefficient under assumptions of perfect reasoners with unlimited attention and retrieval are effective with resource limited agents Furthermore, different tasks make different cognitive demands, and place different requirements on agents' collaborative behavior Tasks which require a high level of belief coordination can benefit from communicative strategies that include redundancy Fault intolerant tasks benefit from redundancy for rehearsing the effects of actions One problem with this efficiency measure is that it ignores the cognitive effort required by resource limited agents in collaborative problem solving In order to test the hypothesized relationship of communicative strategies to agents' resource limits we developed a test-bed environment, Design-World, in which we vary task requirements, agents' resources and communicative strategies Our artificial agents are based on a cognitive model of attention and memory Our experimental results show that communicative strategies that incorporate IRUs can help resource-limited cognitive agents coordinate, limit processing, and improve the quality and robustness of the problem solution We will show that the task determines whether a communicative strategy is beneficial, depending on how the task is defined in terms of fault intolerance and the level of belief coordination required The Design-World task consists of two agents who carry out a dialogue in order to come to an agreement on a furniture layout design for a two room house  The agents' shared intention is to design the house, which requires two subparts of designing room-1 (the study) and designing room-2 (the living room  Agents start with private beliefs about the furniture items they have and their colors See invalid  The Attention/Working Memory model, AWM, is adapted from  Cognitive effort is involved in processes such as making inferences and swapping items from long term memory into working memory The radius of the search sphere in the AWM model is used as the parameter for Design-World agents' resource-bound on attentional capacity In the experiments below, memory is 16x16x16 and the radius parameter varies between 1 and 16, where AWM of 1 gives severely attention limited agents and AWM of 16 means that everything an agent knows is salient When agents have limited working memory, then only a limited number of items can be SALIENT, i This means that mistakes that agents make in their planning process have a plausible cognitive basis A COMMUNICATIVE STRATEGY is a strategy for communicating with another agent, which varies according to the agents' initiative, amount of information about the task, degree of resource-bounds, and communication style , , ,  Design-World agents communicate with an artificial language whose primitive communicative acts are PROPOSE, ACCEPT, REJECT, SAY See invalid  accessible in working memory The variation in the degree of explicitness of a discourse act is the basis of agents' communicative strategies (propose agent-bill agent-kim option-43: put-act (agent-bill green rug room-1 [2 KIM: Then, let's put the green lamp in the study (reject agent-bill agent-kim option-75: put-act (agent-bill green couch room-1  In Design-World, unlike TileWorld, an option that is generated via means-end reasoning or from proposals of other agents only becomes an intention if it is ACCEPTED by both agents See invalid  Agents parameterized with the All-Implicit strategy do not include IRUs in any discourse act or produce any discourse acts labelled as potentially implicit in invalid  Agents parameterized with the Close-Consequence and Explicit-Warrant strategies include IRUs at dialogue segment closings and in proposals In dialogue 1 agent CLC uses the Close-Consequence strategy (propose agent-bill agent-clc option-30: put-act (agent-bill green rug room-1 [2 CLC: So, we've agreed to put the green rug in the study (close agent-clc agent-bill intended-30: put-act (agent-bill green rug room-1 [3 CLC: AGENT-BILL DOESN'T HAVE GREEN RUG The Explicit-Warrant strategy varies the proposal discourse act by including WARRANT IRUs in each proposal (propose agent-iei agent-iei2 option-202: put-act (agent-bill green rug room-1 Since warrants are used by the other agent in deliberation, the Explicit-Warrant strategy can save the other agent the processing involved with determining which facts are relevant for deliberation and retrieving them from memory The Explicit-Warrant strategy also occurs in natural dialogues  Design-World supports the parameterization of the task so that it can be made more difficult to perform by making greater processing demands on the agents The Standard task is defined so that the RAW SCORE that agents achieve for a DESIGN-HOUSE plan, constructed via the dialogue, is the sum of all the furniture items for each valid step in their plan The Zero-Invalids Task is a fault-intolerant version of the task in which any invalid intention invalidates the whole plan.
