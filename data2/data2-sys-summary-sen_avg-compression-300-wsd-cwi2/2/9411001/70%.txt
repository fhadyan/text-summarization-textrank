 These specialized terms may be the best (or only) way to describe their topic Those words that were considered to be possible SL terms by either author were looked up in the appropriate specialized dictionary Those few terms that might be true SL terms that were not included in the dictionary were considered not to be SL terms for the purposes of the data analysis described below Table shows the percent of occurrences for the terms found or not found in the sublanguage dictionaries The largest percent of terms found in the dictionary in one form or another was a tie between Electrical Engineering and Physics, each of which had 66 percent of their terms found in the specialized dictionary The smallest percent of terms found in a sublanguage dictionary was 17 percent for Sociology In most cases, more terms occurred at the start of a phrase in the dictionary than as an exact match for the single term in the dictionary One or more of differentiate entry phrases may have been used in the text, or the word may have been used in a different phrase Table shows that the average term frequencies for those terms that are exact matches or occur at the start of the phrase are much higher than for terms not in the dictionary or are term variants of terms that occur in the dictionary For all domains except for Economics, the average term frequency for exact matches is higher than the average term frequency for terms not in the dictionary For all domains except for Mathematics, the average term frequency for terms occurring at the start of a phrase was higher than for terms not in the dictionary This indicates that the vocabulary used in the Mathematics abstracts matches that listed in the dictionary better than that of the other disciplinese in the adoption of new terms, thus allowing the dictionary to remain current for a longer period of time These term frequencies may be useful in separating terms likely to occur in a specialized dictionary from terms not likely to occur in a specialized dictionary, that is, the separation of SL terms from general terms Usage was examined from several perspectives, including term frequency and specialized and standard dictionary definitions of terms, to identify differences between disciplines and families of disciplines Terms were ranked for each database by their Poisson percentile A highly specialized vocabulary contains terms that are not in standard dictionaries, resulting in coverage gaps for systems that depend on a dictionary for syntactic and/or semantic information Similarly, a low positive value would be found with a term that is commonly found in the databases but is rare in this particular database: such terms are seldom found Table lists the 5 top and bottom terms for each database after the terms were ranked by their Poisson percentile Note that differentiate are extracted from the list of all ranked terms and not just from those identified as SL terms Sixty-two percent of the SL word tokens (technical terms) identified by an expert were not found in the dictionary Some are general `research description terms, such as discussed and method  It is interesting to note that although there is no overlap between disciplines in the top ranked terms, there is some in the bottom ranked terms This is due in part to the ranking procedure, which gives a high rank to terms that are relatively rare (whether as SL terms or not while those terms at the bottom of the lists are those terms likely to occur more evenly throughout the databases Merely finding a word from a particular set of abstracts in the specialized dictionary for that discipline does not guarantee that the word is being used in the abstracts in its SL sense, as defined in the dictionary Many words that have a very specific meaning in a particular domain are also used with a different, more general meaning, in general language The lack of coverage of the SL terms is not surprising, given the wealth of terms used in various disciplines, the speed with which new terminology is adopted, and the propensity of authors to coin new terms The top 10 and bottom 10 ranked terms classified as 1 s from each discipline were selected for examination The word token in the abstract used the same SL word sense as that defined in the special dictionary SG - Same sense, general The word token in the abstract used the same sense as that defined in the special dictionary, which was a general definition That is, the special dictionary defined the word to mean the same as its meaning in general language In general language, it is used in the same way DSL - Different sense, SL The word token in the abstract is used in a different sense from that defined in the special dictionary, but it is still used as an SL term DG - Different sense, general The word token in the abstract is used in a different sense from that defined in the special dictionary, and its usage was in a general language sense Specialized dictionaries may be sought to expand the coverage of the standard dictionary In the Physics abstracts, it was used in the general sense of a span of time A dictionary written to describe words and concepts in a particular discipline may be expected to contain more of the SL terms, and more of the SL senses or meanings of terms, than a general dictionary Not only were terms mostly used in a general sense, it is differentiate general senses that were defined in the specialized dictionaries9% of the term occurrences were used in a general sense8% of the humanities and social science term occurrences were used in a general sense, a smaller proportion than the top-ranked terms However, about half of differentiate were used in a general sense different from that defined in the special dictionary Note that none of the terms in the humanities and social sciences were used in an SL sense different from that defined in the special dictionary Specialized dictionaries also indicate what the important terms and concepts in their disciplines are In summary, most of the occurrences of the top-ranked words used the same sense as that defined in the discipline's special dictionary, whether that was an SL or a general sense Most of the occurrences of the bottom-ranked words in the scientific disciplines were used in a different sense from that given in the dictionary Only one third of the humanities and social science terms' occurrences were used in a different sense In scientific disciplines such as Mathematics or Physics, the words that occur more frequently than expected (the top-ranked terms) are generally used in a specific, SL sense The infrequent words that could also be used in an SL sense are not used that way The shift in usage between the top and bottom ranked words seen here is that the top ranked words are primarily used in the same general sense as that defined in the specialized dictionary, while the bottom ranked words are used almost as frequently in a different general sense The coverage of differentiate specialized dictionaries, however, may vary widely We propose a usage based measure, that may be interpreted as the percent of term uses (for terms in the dictionary) that are used in the text in a sublanguage sense, or the probability that a term is used in a sublanguage sense given that the term is present in the dictionary Mu values may be indicative of the degree to which terms in the sublanguage are differentiated from those in general language A small Mu indicates that technical terms, (those in the SL are frequently used in non-technical senses, while an Mu of 1 represents differentiate terms being used only in a technical sense Values for the measure for the top ten type 1 terms and the bottom ten type 1 terms for each database are given in Table  The ratio of the usage measure Mu for the top terms to that for the bottom terms provides a measure of the difference between differentiate two areas: where represents the Mu value for the top ten terms, with similar notation used for the bottom ten terms Scientific disciplines may exhibit a greater degree of variation between the rate of terms most likely to be used in an SL sense for those terms that are expected to be most characteristic of the SL vs for those terms that are least expected to characterize the SL The terms classified as 1's from each discipline were looked up in the dictionary, first to see whether there was an entry for the word, and next to see if one or more of the word senses was marked as being a term from that discipline There was little difference in the number of terms with entries7% of the scientific disciplines' terms had entries, ranging from 94% (Biology) to 402% of the terms had entries, ranging from 100% of the Sociology terms to 52% of the History terms None of the Sociology and History terms were marked, and 42% of the economics terms were marked, yielding an average number of marked terms for the humanities and social sciences of 1 Few of the humanities and social science terms have meanings which are distinct from those of general usage Different fields have SLs that may be understood to be distinctive in several different senses First, we looked at word frequencies, and especially at the frequencies of SL terms We may measure the general distinctiveness of an SL by noting the overlap between terms defined in an SL dictionary with those terms defined in a general dictionary It may be computed as where SL is the set of terms in the sublanguage dictionary, Gthe set of terms in the general dictionary, and where |x| is the number of items in set x The percentages of entries of technical terms in the general dictionary may be converted to this DS,Gvalue by subtracting them from 100 and then dividing the result by 100 The definitions in general dictionaries for terms in the humanities and social sciences were suggested above to seldom have different senses in the SL and the general language Next, we looked at the coverage of the SL terms in the titles and abstracts by special dictionaries for each of the domains, and by a general dictionary In addition to comparing SLs with the general language, two SLs may be compared with one another These two distinctiveness measures may be used to examine a number of SL phenomena As defined, they may measure the distinctiveness of those terms included in a specialized dictionary To the extent that a sublanguage may be defined as those specialized terms occurring in a discipline specific dictionary, differentiate dictionary based measures may be used as measures of sublanguage distinctiveness A third possibility would be to combine dictionary definitions with meanings extracted from the context in which the terms are used in the abstracts The final question we investigated was whether term frequencies could be used to classify abstracts by discipline The databases used in the analyses above and described in Table were used for the classification experiments It may include words or phrases that are not used in general language, and may also use familiar words in unfamiliar ways In other words, the document being classified is not used in learning the Poisson percentile used to classify that individual document Terms from a list of 203 stopwords were removed from the database For a few titles, terms occurred only in that document and, when differentiate frequencies are subtracted from the database frequencies, the terms have a frequency of 0 with an average frequency of 0 These terms have an indeterminate and thus unusable Poisson percentile This, combined with deletion of the stopwords, results in some titles effectively having no terms that could be used to classify the document Word frequencies, the overlap of usage between related and unrelated domains, inclusion of SL terms in general and specialized dictionaries, and similar data are informative about the nature of the language used in different disciplines and the differences between the disciplines [  Vocabulary in abstracts from different disciplines varies considerably from discipline to discipline This measure can be based on either the terms of the SL or on the terms' definitions Usage refers to both the words that are used and the word senses that are used General: The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition Biology: Chambers Biology Dictionary Economics: Dictionary of Economics The list of SL terms used in a discipline may include words that are not used (or are used very infrequently) in general language, such as the Physics term dipole  Electrical Engineering: IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms, Third Edition History: Macmillan Concise Dictionary of World History SL terms may also include words that are familiar in general language, but are used in a special, very specific sense in the language of the domain Math: Mathematics Dictionary, Fifth Edition Physics: Dictionary of Physics, Third Edition Psychology: The International Dictionary of Psychology 9,000 entries Sociology: Sociology Word and word sense usage in a particular discipline may also be borrowed from related domains Whether borrowed terms should be considered part of the SL may be a matter of definition There is another class of terms used in the discourse of a discipline that is harder to classify as SL or not SL Bonzi (1984) chose not to include such terms in her study One problem is that of new terms; a dictionary, especially in print format, will always be a few years behind current usage The reader must expect that such terms are defined in the particular paper in which they are used Finally, no dictionary is complete: the restrictions of space and time will always lead to the omission from the dictionary of terms that another person might consider important A specialized dictionary may also include some of the terms described in the preceding section that are crucial to the discourse of the domain, but not specific to just that SL Not only will differentiate terms appear in more than one dictionary, they will also be defined in approximately the same way General, or standard, college or unabridged dictionaries contain SL terms from many disciplines Definitions given in a general dictionary may not be as detailed or complete as those in a specialized dictionary For example, the term linear referred to earlier had two senses given in the Biology dictionary The standard dictionary, however, lists only the first one as a Biology SL sense Damerau dam:gene,dam:eval discusses some additional problems with using standard dictionaries as an aid in identifying SL terms In summary, which terms are considered to be part of the SL may vary according to several factors By examining terms in light of both dictionary and text based standards, we hope to discover some ways in which SLs can be differentiated Abstracts representing work in eight different disciplines were collected by querying CD-ROM databases for each discipline The recency of a dictionary may have some effect on its coverage of SL terms Given the time lag inherent in publishing a printed dictionary, a dictionary published in 1990, for example, may not include important terms from abstracts published in the same year A systematic sample of 500 terms was taken from each database.
