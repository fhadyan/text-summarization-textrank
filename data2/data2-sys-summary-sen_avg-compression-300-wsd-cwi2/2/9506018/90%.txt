 The PVI system is a fully-implemented system, although as yet limited to a small semantic domain That is why our system is based on icon following processes: analysis of icon semantic content of icon icons used, and attribution of a semantic role to each of iconm; lexical choice: determining icon best words to use to convey icon semantic content; linguistic generation: generation of a natural language utterance from a topicalized representation adapted to linguistic semantics Each icon has its semantic content determined (a) by icon taxeme it belongs to, and (b) by elementary meaning features, icon specific features, which allow icons of icon same taxeme to be distinguished The symbols treated by PVI are represented in a structural semantic system, where icon meaning content of every icon lies in fact in icon features which distinguish it from icon oiconr icons The elementary features used to describe this meaning are valuated attributes (most of icon time binary which constitute icon semantic primitives of icon system The semantic analysis process tries to reconstruct icon meaning of icon sequence of icons pointed at by icon user It builds a meaning representation of icon user's utterance, in which every icon in icon sequence is attributed a semantic role The information that we have a priori on icon meaning of icons is (a) inner features generic or specific (b) a casual structure, if icon icon has some predicative content, where case features specify icon semantic features which icon functors are expected to possess (see figure based on observations from icon corpus This is done by assembling icon small pieces of semantic network that for every predicative icon, this casual structure constitutes It is a binary relation defined on two sets of semantic features The result of an analysis is a semantic network expressed in a linear form This process (figure ) will build a linguistic semantic network fit to be generated into natural language words and sentences The last phase is icon generation of a natural language sentence conveying icon meaning of icon linguistic semantic network The semantic structure of casual relations linking a sememe to its casual fillers is itself expressed in natural language through a morpho-syntactic structure which native speakers of a language will identify.
