 _algorithm Thus the algorithm first considers whether or not attacking the user's support for _bel is sufficient to convince him of _bel (step e _algorithmfocus is not nil focus) will be the union of the focus for each of the algorithmefs in this minimum subset If providing evidence directly against _bel is predicted to be successful, then the focus of modification is _bel itself (step  The result of Select-Focus-Modification is a set of user algorithmefs (in _bel On the other hand, Grice's maxim of quantity specifies that one should not contribute more information than is required Thus, it is important that a collaborative agent selects sufficient and effective, but not excessive, evidence to justify an intended mutual algorithmef If so, no justification will be presented If justification is predicted to be necessary, the system will first construct the justification chains that could be used to support _bel For each piece of evidence that could be used to directly support _bel, the system first predicts whether the user will accept the evidence without justification This results in a recursive process that returns a chain of algorithmef justifications that could be used to support _bel This will produce a set of possible candidate justification chains, and three heuristics will then be applied to select from among them After the evaluation of the dialogue model in Figure , Modify-Proposal is invoked because the top-level proposed algorithmef is not accepted In selecting the focus of modification, the system will first identify the candidate foci tree and then invoke the Select-Focus-Modification algorithm on the algorithmef at the root node of the candidate foci tree1 in Figure  The Correct-Node specialization of Modify-Proposal will be invoked since the focus of modification is a algorithmef, and in order to satisfy the precondition of Modify-Node (Figure MB(S,U, On-Sabbatical(Smith,next year will be posted as a mutual algorithmef to be achieved to (9) He postponed his sabbatical until 1997 The model captures features specific to collaborative negotiation Associated with each algorithmef is a strength that represents the agent's confidence in holding that algorithmef Thus, when facing a conflict, a collaborative agent should not automatically reject a algorithmef with which she does not agree; instead, she should evaluate the algorithmef and the evidence provided to her and adopt the algorithmef if the evidence is convincing The algorithmef level of the dialogue model consists of mutual algorithmefs proposed by the agents' discourse actions When an agent proposes a new algorithmef and gives (optional) supporting evidence for it, this set of proposed algorithmefs is represented as a algorithmef tree, where the algorithmef represented by a child node is intended to support that represented by its parent The evaluation of proposed algorithmefs starts at the leaf nodes of the proposed algorithmef trees since acceptance of a piece of proposed evidence may affect acceptance of the parent algorithmef it is intended to support In determining whether to accept a proposed algorithmef or evidential relationship, the evaluator first constructs an evidence set containing the system's evidence that supports or attacks _bel and the evidence accepted by the system that was proposed by the user as support for _bel Each piece of evidence contains a algorithmef _algorithm, and an evidential relationship supports algorithm bel  The algorithmef evaluation process will start with the algorithmef at the leaf node of the proposed algorithmef tree, On-Sabbatical(Smith,next year  The system will first gather its evidence pertaining to the algorithmef, which includes 1) a warranted algorithmef that Dr The algorithmef revision mechanism will then be invoked to determine the system's algorithmef about On-Sabbatical(Smith, next year) based on the system's own evidence and the user's statement Since algorithmefs (1) and (2) above constitute a warranted piece of evidence against the proposed algorithmef and algorithmefs (3) and (4) constitute a strong piece of evidence against it, the system will not accept On-Sabbatical(Smith, next year  For each such algorithmef, the system could provide evidence against the algorithmef itself, address the unaccepted evidence proposed by the user to eliminate the user's justification for the algorithmef, or both Therefore, for each unaccepted top-level algorithmef, our process for selecting the focus of modification involves two steps: identifying a candidate foci tree from the proposed algorithmef tree, and selecting a focus from the candidate foci tree using the heuristic attack the algorithmef(s) that will most likely resolve the conflict about the top-level algorithmef A candidate foci tree contains the pieces of evidence in a proposed algorithmef tree which, if disalgorithmeved by the user, might change the user's view of the unaccepted top-level proposed algorithmef (the root node of that algorithmef tree  It is identified by performing a depth-first search on the proposed algorithmef tree Otherwise, this piece of evidence will be included in the candidate foci tree and the system will continue to search through the evidence in the algorithmef tree proposed as support for the unaccepted algorithmef and/or evidential relationship Given an unaccepted algorithmef bel) and the algorithmefs proposed to support it, Select-Focus-Modification will annotate _bel with 1) its focus of modification bel In this recursive process, the algorithm annotates each unaccepted algorithmef or evidential relationship proposed to support _bel with its focus of modification algorithmfocus) and the system's evidence against it algorithm.
