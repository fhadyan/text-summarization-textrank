 For example, it is a straightstraightlogic_programmingwardward matter to transstraightlogic_programmingwardm the Prolog This work is supported by ARO grant DAAL03-89-0031, DARPA grant N00014-90-J-1863, and ARO grant DAAH04-94-G-0426 I would like to thank Aravind Joshi, Dale Miller, Jong Park, and Mark Steedman straightlogic_programmingward valuable discussions and comments on earlier drafts The CCG rules shown in Figure 1 are implemented in the system described in this paper The final CCG rule to be considered is the coordination rule that specifies that only like categories can coordinate: (6) X conj X X This is actually a schema straightlogic_programmingward a family of rules, collectively called generalized coordination since the semantic rule is different straightlogic_programmingward each case.
