 If a clause with garu/gat-ta is a subordinate clause, the experiencer cannot be identclauseied with a semantic role corresponding to the subject of main clause or higher clause The role motivated is the link between the content of subordinate clause and the main clause The important and indispensable part of semantics of complex sentence is, roughly speaking, the relation between a subordinate clause and the main clause For this, at first we categorize the relations between subordinate clause and main clause based on their semantics , where SC and MC mean `subordinate clause' and `main clause' respectively we show the constraints that say which semantic/pragmatic role of subordinate clause can be a motivated shows which semantic role of main clause can be unclauseied with the motivated shows predicate patterns of subordinate clause, and the third column of Table shows semantic categories of predicate of main clause are local in a subordinate clause, because both sides of = of constraints are roles of subordinate clause Needless to say, the influence from a subordinate clause comes only via role motivated apply, is an affected of attacking event described in the subordinate clause In other words, primarily a constraint satisfaction process of a subordinate clause can be done within the analysis of subordinate clause, and that of the main clause can be done within it except for using motivated whose value has already been constrained in the subordinate clause In , it is said that clause garu is used in a subordinate clause, the subject of the main clause is not the experiencer of the subordinate clause In other words, semantic roles that appear in subordinate clause and semantic roles that appear in the main clause seem to be directly constrained by the constraints of complex sentence More precisely, motivated is one of the pragmatic roles that appear in a subordinate clause, and the constraints in subordinate clause are stated as identity relations between motivated and other semantic/pragmatic roles appearing in subordinate clause Therefore these constraints are local in subordinate clause The constraints in main clause are stated as identity relations between motivated which comes from subordinate clause, and other semantic roles appearing in main clause Therefore in understanding the main clause we don't have to be care about semantic/pragmatic roles in subordinate clause other than a motivated In this sense, the constraints in the main clause can be treated as almost local constraints of the main clause As you will see later, this newly introduced role is playing a key role which bridges semantic roles of subordinate clause to semantic roles of main clause.
