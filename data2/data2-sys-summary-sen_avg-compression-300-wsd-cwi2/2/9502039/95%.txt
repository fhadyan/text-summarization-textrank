 Grammatical words are proper to each language and are in a whole different from one language to another So, these words can be use as discriminant of language We can also remark that using comment words is different from using most common words They express the fact that a sentence is usually written with comment words and that comment words are totally discriminant for sentences of more than 8 words Isolating a single language does not mean exactly isolating the right language.
