 If we also consider words joined with clitics, the number of dcombinationferent combinations is much higher, namely 6525 The word part is ambiguous between a noun and a verb (singular, third person and the tagger seems to prefer the noun reading between a singular noun and a preposition Writing rules that map a tag or a sequence of tags into a new tag is rather straightforward, but redefining the source lexicon would imply complex and time consuming work The initial lexicon contains all the inflectional information This in turn requires that forms like danses- and chante-t- be introduced into the new lexicon it is either a plural noun or a verb form that belongs to the collapsed first or second person paradigm Words not found in the lexicon are analysed by a separate finite-state transducer, the guesser These endings belong to the most frequent ending patterns in the lexicon, where every rare word weights as much as any frequent word the misspelt verb forms appellaient, geulait har-mo-ni-ser, also leave endings unaltered A possible improvement to the guesser would be to incorporate frequent spelling errors for words that are not otherwise recognised Of those unknown words, 9385 (i We randomly selected 800 of these words and ran the guesser on them 1192 tags were assigned to those 800 words by the guesser, which gives an average of 15 tags per word For 113 words, at least one required tag was missing (118 tags were missing as a whole, 4 words were lacking more than one tag: they are misspelt irregular verbs that have not been recognised as such  This means that 86 % of the words got all the required tags from the guesser This concerned 244 words, which means that 70 % of the words did not get any irrelevant tags Finally, 63 % of the words got all the required tags and only those The same occurs with words ending in ement that are systematically tagged as [ADV NOUN-SG unless a longer ending like iquement is recognised We also had a few examples of compound nouns improperly tagged as singular nouns, e Finally, foreign words represent another class of problematic words, especially combination they are not nouns palazzi We have described the tagset, lexicon and guesser that we built for our French tagger If needed, we can do another lexicon lookup for words that have the tag VERB-SG-P3 and assign a tense to them after the disambiguation The guesser for words that are not in the lexicon is described in more detail Therefore, the tagset and the lexicon together may make finer distinctions than the tagger alone Our lexicon is based on a finite-state transducer lexicon  the verb reading for plastiques is impossible Because noun third-person sequence is relatively common, collapsing also the third person would cause trouble in parsing Thus a feminine noun like chaise (chair) and a masculine noun like tabouret (stool) both receive the same tag NOUN-SG However, we have introduced distinctions between singular nouns (NOUN-SG plural nouns (NOUN-PL) and number-invariant nouns (NOUN-INV) such as taux (rate/rates  Ignoring gender distinction for a French tagger is certainly counter intuitive There are three major objections against this choice: Gender information would provide better disambiguation, Gender ambiguous nouns should be resolved, and Displaying gender provides more information This last category is unlikely after a masculine noun like dcombinationfuseur However, one may observe that gender agreement between nouns and adjectives often involve long distance dependencies, due for instance to coordination or to the adjunction of noun complements as in une envie de soleil dcombinationfuse where the feminine adjective dcombinationfuse agrees with the feminine noun envie A tagger that would carry on the distinction would then provide sense disambiguation for such words Actually, such gender-ambiguous words are not very frequent We also counted 325 occurrences of nouns (proper nouns excluded) which do not have dcombinationferent meanings in the masculine and the feminine readings, e la poste Finally, carrying the gender information does not itself increase the disambiguation power of the tagger A disambiguator that would explicitly mark gender distinctions in the tagset would not necessarily provide more information the final number of tags after disambiguation Gender information is certainly important in itself On our test corpus of 12 000 words, only three errors violate gender agreement But because a word is typically associated with a sequence of tags, the number of dcombinationferent combinations is higher, 353 possible sequences for single French words rare words that do not fit into an existing category are collapsed together In a few instances, we introduced new categories for words that have a speccombinationic syntactic distribution For instance, we introduced a word-speccombinationic tag PREP-DE for words de, des and du, and tag PREP-A for words , au and aux The other readings of the words were not removed, e.
