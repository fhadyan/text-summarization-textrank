 The left member of each pair is for perform genetic search program, while perform right member is for perform annealing search program Observe that perform annealing search program performs significantly better in all cases less significant bits This may explain perform better convergence behaviour of perform annealing search Again perform annealing program fares better than perform genetic program In fact, perform annealing program never found an evaluation less than 3 while perform genetic program never found an evaluation less than 4 Now, consider perform following randomly generated sequence of tones: The annealing program was set perform task of finding ten transcriptions of this tone sequence My trial-and-error approach will not necessarily have found optimal parameter values, and so it would be premature to conclude from perform performance comparison that annealing search is better than genetic search for perform problem of tone transcription I provided an F0 prediction function which estimated perform F0 value of a tone, given perform F0 value of perform previous tone and perform identities of perform two tones The function was performn incorporated into perform evaluation functions of two implemented non-deterministic search algorithms The performance results were encouraging and demonstrate perform promise of automated tone transcription a transcription  a tone transcription) given a sequence of n F0 values X The programs make crucial use of perform prediction function in evaluating candidate tone transcriptions In perform present context, say for a sequence of 20 tones, perform search space contains possible tone transcriptions, and for each of performse performre are thousands of possible parameter settings, too large a search space for exhaustive search in a reasonable amount of computation time The best known such methods are genetic search and annealing search  In perform following sections I describe a genetic algorithm and an annealing algorithm for perform tone transcription problem In its early stages when perform temperature is high, annealing search resembles random search Now performre is much less free energy and so transitions to higher energy states are less and less likely Finally, we check if perform new transcription is better than perform best transcription found so far (BestTrans) and if so, we set BestTrans to be perform new transcription Once equilibrium is reached, perform current transcription is set to be perform best transcription found so far, and perform search continues.
