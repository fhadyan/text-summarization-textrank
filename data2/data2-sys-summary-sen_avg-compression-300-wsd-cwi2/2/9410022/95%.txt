 Observe that the annealing search program performs significantly better in all cases less significant bits In fact, the annealing program never found an evaluation less than 3 while the genetic program never found an evaluation less than 4 Now, consider the following randomly generated sequence of tones: The annealing program was set the task of finding ten transcriptions of this tone sequence My trial-and-error approach will not necessarily have found optimal parameter values, and so it would be premature to conclude from the performance comparison that annealing search is better than genetic search for the problem of tone transcription a transcription  a tone transcription) given a sequence of n F0 values X The programs make crucial use of the prediction function in evaluating candidate tone transcriptions The best known such methods are genetic search and annealing search  In the following sections I describe a genetic algorithm and an annealing algorithm for the tone transcription problem In its early stages when the temperature is high, annealing search resembles random search Once equilibrium is reached, the current transcription is set to be the best transcription found so far, and the search continues.
