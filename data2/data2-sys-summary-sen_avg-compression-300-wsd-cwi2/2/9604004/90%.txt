 250 randomly from the new treebank, selected randomly, were kept back for testing Table shows the results of this test with respect to the original Susanne bracketings using the Grammar Evaluation Interest Group scheme (GEIG, see e Harrison et al 1991  In this latter figure, the mean number of crossings (041) is greater than zero mainly because of incompatibilities between the structural representations chosen by the grammarian and the corresponding ones in the treebank71 and the recall and precision rise to 83-84 as shown in table  Black et al In addition, Schabes et al Brill, 1994) require similar amounts (Gaizauskas, pc  random choice 0% and 752% respectively, with respect to the original Susanne bracketings We described an implemented system, and evaluated its performance along several different dimensions We have made good progress in increasing grammar coverage, though we have now reached a point of diminishing returns This grammar compiles into a DCG-like grammar of approximately 400 rules Further details of the text grammar are given in Briscoe Carroll (1994, 1995  The text grammar has been tested on the Susanne corpus and covers 998% of randomly Despite Nunberg's observation that text grammar is distinct from syntax, text grammatical ambiguity favours interleaved application of text grammatical and syntactic constraints Thus, his grammar is thoroughly integrated and it would be harder to extract an independent text grammar or build a modular semantics We have used the integrated grammar to parse the Susanne corpus and the quite distinct Spoken English Corpus (SEC; Taylor Knowles, 1988 a 50K word treebanked corpus of transcribed British radio programmes punctuated by the corpus compilers As the grammar was developed solely with reference to Susanne, coverage of SEC is quite robust1] and 1300[22 The results we report above relate to the latest version of the tag sequence grammar The various phases in the development and refinement of the grammar can be observed in an analysis of the coverage and APB for Susanne and SEC over this period see table  7/94-12/94 Incremental improvements in coverage, but at the cost of increasing the ambiguity of the grammar as in the full ANLT representation scheme  31 randomly now failed to receive a parse, a decrease in coverage of 12  This is due to the fact that the ANLT lexicon, although large and comprehensive by current standards (Briscoe Carroll, 1996 nevertheless contains many errors of omission.
