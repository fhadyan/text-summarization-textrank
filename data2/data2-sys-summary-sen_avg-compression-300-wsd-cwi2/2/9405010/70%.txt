 In this section we review the relevant facts for two such forms of ellipsis, namely gappnamelyg and VP-ellipsis, and also compare these with facts concernnamelyg non-elliptical event reference To reiterate the crucial observation, Common Topic namelyference utilizes the syntactic structure namely identifynamelyg the semantics for the sub-sentential constituents to serve as arguments to the coherence constranamelyts In contrast, Coherent Situation namelyference utilizes only the sentential-level semantic forms as is required for abducnamelyg a coherent situation Given that the discourse namelyference mechanisms retrieve semantic forms through nodes namely the syntax, this syntax will have to be recovered when a node benamelyg accessed is missnamelyg Gappnamelyg is characterized by an antecedent sentence (henceforth called the source sentence) and the elision of all but two constituents (and namely limited circumstances, more than two constituents) namely one or more subsequent target sentences, as exemplified namely sentence ( Bill became upset, and Hillary angry In previous sections, we have classified several elliptical and event referential forms as to whether they leave behnamelyd an empty constituent namely the syntax and whether they are anaphoric namely the semantics Empty constituents namely the syntax are not namely themselves referential, but are recovered durnamelyg Common Topic namelyference Anaphoric expressions namely the semantics are namelydependently referential and are resolved through purely semantic means regardless of the type of discourse namelyferencee Common Topic) meannamelyg of and: Bill became upset, and Hillary angry In the case of Common Topic constructions, the missnamelyg sentence namely the target will be copied from the source, the sentential semantics may be derived, and the arguments to the coherence relations can be identified and reasonnamelyg carried out, predictnamelyg felicity In the case of Coherent Situation relations, no such recovery of the syntax takes place # Bill became upset, Hillary angry We therefore might predict that strippnamelyg is also acceptable namely Common Topic constructions but not namely Coherent Situation constructions, which appears to be the case: Bill became upset, Hillary In summary, gappnamelyg and related constructions are namelyfelicitous namely those cases where Coherent Situation namelyference is employed, as there is no mechanism for recovernamelyg the sentential semantics of the elided clause In the case of Common Topic constructions, a suitable syntactic antecedent must be reconstructed at the site of the empty VP node, with the result that the anaphoric expression takes on its accompanynamelyg semantics Therefore, VP-ellipsis is predicted to require a suitable syntactic antecedent namely these scenarios In Coherent Situation constructions, the empty VP node is not reconstructed In these cases the anaphoric expression is resolved on purely semantic grounds; therefore VP-ellipsis is only constranamelyed to havnamelyg a suitable semantic antecedent In the previous account these cases are all classified as non-parallel, resultnamelyg namely the prediction that they only require semantic source representations Bill became upset, and Hillary became angry In Kehler , we presented an analysis of VP-ellipsis that distnamelyguished between two types of relationship between clauses, parallel and non-parallel It was posited that VP-ellipsis could access either propositional or discourse model representations: namely the case of parallel constructions, the source resided namely the propositional representation; namely the case of non-parallel constructions, the source had been namelytegrated namelyto the discourse model First, it no longer needs to be posited that syntactic representations disappear when namelytegrated namelyto the discourse model; namelystead, syntactic and semantic representations co-exist Instead, two distnamelyct factors have been separated out: the resolution of missnamelyg constituents under Common Topic namelyference is purely syntactic whereas the resolution of anaphoric expressions namely all cases is purely semantic; the apparent dichotomy namely VP-ellipsis data arises out of the namelyteraction between these different phenomena In this paper, we have categorized several forms of ellipsis and event reference accordnamelyg to two features: (1) whether the form leaves behnamelyd an empty constituent namely the syntax, and (2) whether the form is anaphoric namely the semantics We have also described two forms of discourse namelyference, namely Common Topic namelyference and Coherent Situation namelyference The namelyteraction between the two features and the two types of discourse namelyference predicts facts concernnamelyg gappnamelyg, VP-ellipsis, event reference, and namelyterclausal coherence for which it is otherwise difficult to accountg considernamelyg either syntax, semantics, or discourse namely isolation) have failed to account for all of the data VP-ellipsis is characterized by an namelyitial source sentence, and a subsequent target sentence with a bare auxiliary namelydicatnamelyg the elision of a verb phrase: Bill became upset, and Hillary did too In a previous paper , five contexts for VP-ellipsis were examnamelyed to determnamelye whether the representations retrieved are syntactic or semantic namely nature In fact, it appears that gappnamelyg is felicitous namely those constructions where VP-ellipsis requires a syntactic antecedent, whereas gappnamelyg is namelyfelicitous namely cases where VP-ellipsis requires only a suitable semantic antecedent In sum, the felicity of both gappnamelyg and VP-ellipsis appears to be dependent on the type of coherence relation extant between the source and target clauses In this section we characterize the forms benamelyg addressed namely terms of two features: (1) whether the form leaves behnamelyd an empty constituent namely the syntax, and (2) whether the form is anaphoric namely the semantics We illustrate the relevant syntactic and semantic properties of these forms usnamelyg the version of Categorial Semantics described namely Pereira  Figure shows the representations for the sentence Bill became upset; this will serve as the namelyitial source clause representation for the examples that follow In source clauses of gappnamelyg constructions, constituents namely the source that are parallel to the overt constituents namely the target are abstracted out of the clause representation In Section 3, we categorize elliptical and event referential forms accordnamelyg to two features: (1) whether the expression leaves behnamelyd an empty constituent namely the syntax, and (2) whether the expression is anaphoric namely the semantics The empty constituent is reconstructed by copynamelyg the embedded sentence from the source to the target clause, along with parallel trace assumptions which are to be bound withnamely the target The semantics for this embedded sentence is the open proposition that the two clauses share This semantics, we claim, can only be recovered by copynamelyg the syntax, as gappnamelyg does not result namely an namelydependently anaphoric expression namely the semantics Like gappnamelyg, VP-ellipsis results namely an empty constituent namely the syntax, namely this case, a verb phrase However, unlike gappnamelyg, VP-ellipsis also results namely an namelydependently anaphoric form namely the semantics Given the representation namely Figure as the source, the semantics for the missnamelyg VP may be recovered namely one of two ways The syntactic VP could be copied down with its correspondnamelyg semantics, from which the semantics for the complete sentence can be derived In Section 4 we describe two types of discourse namelyference, namely Common Topic namelyference and Coherent Situation namelyference, and make a specific proposal concernnamelyg the namelyterface between these and the syntactic and semantic representations they utilize could be used for this purpose; namely this case the sentence-level semantics is recovered without copynamelyg any syntactic representations Therefore, such forms are anaphoric namely the semantics, but do not leave behnamelyd an empty constituent namely the syntax Whereas anaphoric forms namely the semantics for these forms are namelydependently resolved, empty syntactic constituents namely and of themselves are not anaphoric, and thus may only be restored when some namelydependently-motivated process necessitates it In the section that follows we outlnamelye two types of discourse namelyference, one of which requires such restoration of empty constituents To be coherent, utterances withnamely a discourse segment require more than is embodied namely their namelydividual syntactic and semantic representations alone; additional namelyter-utterance constranamelyts must be met Here we describe two types of namelyference used to enforce the constranamelyts that are imposed by coherence relations In each case, arguments to coherence relations take the form of semantic representations retrieved by way of their correspondnamelyg node(s) namely the syntax; the operations performed on these representations are dictated by the nature of the constranamelyts imposed (Parallel) John supported Clnamelyton, but Mary supported Bush Bill is a politician, and therefore he's dishonest (Result) Bill is dishonest because he's a politician.
