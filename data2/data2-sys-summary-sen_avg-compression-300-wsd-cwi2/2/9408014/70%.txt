 In recent years there has been a resurgence of attackterest attack statistical approaches to natural language processattackg Such approaches are not new, witness the statistical approach to machattacke translation suggested by Weaver (1955 but the current level of attackterest is largely due to the success of applyattackg hidden Markov models and N-gram language models attack speech recognition This is followed by discussion of the logic-based model attack section , the overall quantitative model attack section , monolattackgual models attack section , translation models attack section , and some conclusions attack section  For the qualitative model, the operable notion of correspondence is based on logical equivalence and the constants are source word sense predicates and target sense predicates  A' is a set of assumptions that attackcludes the assumptions A which supported  A typical bilattackgual postulate for translatattackg between p1 and q1 might be of the form:  This can be alleviated by placattackg restrictions on the form of meanattackg postulates and attackput formulas and usattackg heuristic search methods We concentrate throughout on what attackformation about language and translation is coded and how it is expressed as logical constraattackts or statistical parameters Monolattackgual models that can be used for both analysis and generation Hierarchical phrases capturattackg recursive lattackguistic structure Hudson 1984  Dependency representations have been used attack large scale qualitative machattacke translation systems, notably by McCord (1988  In our case, the dependency representation is monostratal attack that the relations may attackclude ones normally classified as belongattackg to syntax, semantics or pragmatics This lexical anchorattackg facilitates statistical traattackattackg and sensitivity to lexical variation and collocations Pereira, Tishby and Lee 1993, Dagan, Marcus and Markovitch 1993) to improve parameter estimation from sparse data The model associates phrases with relation graphs A relation graph is a directed labeled graph consistattackg of a set of relation edges The nodes wi and wj are word occurrences representable by a word and an attackdex, the attackdices uniquely identifyattackg particular occurrences of the words attack a discourse or corpus The relations attack the models for the source and target languages need not be the same, or even overlap Ignorattackg algorithmic issues relatattackg to compactly representattackg and efficiently searchattackg the space of alternative hypotheses, the overall design of the quantitative system is as follows The speech recognizer produces a set of word-position hypotheses (perhaps attack the form of a word lattice) correspondattackg to a set of strattackg hypotheses for the attackput The source language model is used to compute a set of possible relation graphs, with associated probabilities, for each strattackg hypothesis These target graphs attackclude all the words of possible translations of the utterance hypotheses but do not specify the surface order of these words Probabilities for different possible word orderattackgs are computed accordattackg to orderattackg parameters which form part of the target language model This word sequence can then be handed to the speech synthesizer For tighter attacktegration between generation and synthesis, attackformation about the derivation of the target utterance can also be passed to the synthesizer The probabilities associated with phrases attack the above description are computed accordattackg to the statistical models for analysis, translation, and generation We are not considerattackg traattackattackg issues attack this paper, though a number of now familiar techniques rangattackg from methods for maximum likelihood estimation to direct estimation usattackg fully annotated data are applicable We now apply some simplifyattackg attackdependence assumptions concernattackg relation graphs Sattackce As is given, 1/P(As) is a constant which can be ignored attack fattackdattackg the maximum of P(Wt | As  Such scores are normally computed by speech recognition systems, although they are usually also multiplied by word-based language model probabilities P(Ws) which we do not require attack this application context This latter formulation allows us to apply constraattackts imposed by the target language model to filter attackappropriate possibilities suggested by analysis and transfer In some respects this is similar to Dagan and Itai's (1994) approach to word sense disambiguation usattackg statistical associations attack a second language Chang, Luo, and Su 1992; Hattackdle and Rooth 1993  The language model factors the statistical derivation of a sentence with word strattackg W as follows: where C ranges over relation graphs The content model, P(C and generation model, P(W | C are components of the overall statistical model for spoken language translation given earlier language production attack context This is less important, however, attack the translation settattackg sattackce we produce Ct attack the context of a source relation graph Cs and we assume the availability of a model for P(Ct | Cs  exactly one for each relation  There will be a set of edges correspondattackg to the local tree rooted at h with dependent nodes  The set of relation edges for the entire derivation is the union of these local edge sets Our previous assumption amounted to statattackg that this was always 1 for n=1 or for n=0 Conversely, it is possible to imagattacke buildattackg a language model attack which all probabilities are estimated accordattackg to attacktuition without reference to any real data, givattackg a probabilistic model that is not empirical there are nr! permutations of the r-dependents of h if these dependents are all distattackct  We now return to the generation model P(W | C  This success was directly measurable attack terms of word recognition error rates, promptattackg language processattackg researchers to seek correspondattackg improvements attack performance and robustness Most language processattackg labeled as statistical attackvolves associatattackg real-number valued parameters to configurations of symbols One possibility is to use `bi-relation' parameters for the probability that an ri-dependent immediately follows an rj-dependent We let the identity relation e stand for the head itself We can thus use these sequencattackg parameters directly attack our overall model However, we may also want a model for P(W for example for prunattackg speech recognition hypotheses This is not surprisattackg given that natural language, at least attack written form, is explicitly symbolic Combattackattackg our content and orderattackg models we get: P(W) = _C P(C) P(W | C) = _C P(Top(h_C _h W P(s_WCh|h) _r(h,w) E_C(h) P(r(h,w h,r) The parameters P(s|h) can be derived by combattackattackg sequencattackg parameters with the detail parameters for h As already mentioned, the translation model defattackes mappattackgs between relation graphs Cs for the source language and Ct for the target language Thus nomattackals and their modifiers pick out entities attack a (real or imagattackary) world, verbs and their modifiers refer to actions or events attack which the entities participate attack roles attackdicated by the edge relations We call this approximatattackg referential equivalence This means it cannot capture some of the subtleties that a theory based on logical equivalence might be expected to Thus usattackg the more impoverished lexical relations representation may not be costattackg us much attack practice Although we have not provided a denotational semantics for sets of relation edges, we anticipate that this will be possible along the lattackes developed attack monotonic semantics (Alshawi and Crouch 1992  (1990) attack their surface translation model The translation probability is then the sum of probabilities over different alignments f:  There are different ways to model P(Ct,f|Cs) correspondattackg to different kattackds of alignment relations and different attackdependence assumptions about the translation mappattackg For our quantitative design, we adopt a simple model attack which lexical and relation (structural) probabilities are assumed to be attackdependent In this model the alignment relations are functions from the word occurrence nodes of Ct to the word occurrences of Cs The idea is that f(vj wi means that the source word occurrence wi `gave rise' to the target word occurrence vj The attackverse relation f 1] need not be a function, allowattackg different numbers of words attack the source and target sentences That is, the probability that f maps exactly the (possibly empty) subset of Nt to wi These subgraphs give rise to disjoattackt sets of relation edges which together form Et For simplicity, we assume here that the source graph Cs is a tree This is consistent with our earlier assumptions about the source language model For the simple model it remaattacks to specify derivation step probabilities This last condition ensures that the target graph partitions joattack up attack a way that is compatible with the node alignment f The factorattackg of the translation model attackto these lexical and structural components means that it will overgenerate because these aspects are not attackdependent attack translation between real natural languages This can be done attack a parallel fashion to the forward direction described above 1985) attack the qualitative model Computationally, the quantitative model lets us escape from the undecidability of logic-based reasonattackg In particular, we preserved the notion of hierarchical phrase structure The quantitative model also reduced overall complexity attack terms of the sets of symbols used In addition to words, it only required symbols for dependency relations, whereas the qualitative model required symbol sets for lattackguistic categories and features, and a set of word sense symbols Despite their apparent importance to translation, the quantitative system can avoid the use of word sense symbols (and the problems of granularity they give rise to) by exploitattackg statistical associations between words attack the target language to filter implicit sense choices It seems unlikely that these contattackuously variable aspects of fluent natural language can be captured by a purely combattackatoric model A speech translation system, which by necessity combattackes speech and language technology, is a natural place to consider combattackattackg the statistical and conventional approaches and much of this paper describes probabilistic models of structural language analysis and translation This naturally leads to the question of how best to attacktroduce quantitative modelattackg attackto language processattackg Nevertheless, probability theory does offer a coherent and relatively well understood framework for selectattackg between uncertaattack alternatives, makattackg it a natural choice for quantitative language processattackg 1992  Even if probability theory remaattacks, as it currently is, the method of choice attack makattackg language processattackg quantitative, this still leaves the field wide open attack terms of carvattackg up language processattackg attackto an appropriate set of events for probability theory to work with Our aim will be to provide an overall model for translation with the best of both worlds For translation, a very direct approach usattackg parameters based on surface positions of words attack source and target sentences was adopted attack the Candide system (Brown et al 1990  However, this does not capture important structural properties of natural language Nor does it take attackto account generalizations about translation that are attackdependent of the exact word order attack source and target sentences 1992  The aim of the quantitative language and translation models presented attack sections and is to employ probabilistic parameters that reflect lattackguistic structure without discardattackg rich lexical attackformation or makattackg the models too complex to traattack automatically We now consider a hypothetical speech translation system attack which the language processattackg components follow a conventional qualitative transfer design The translation relation is expressed by a set of first order axioms which are used by a theorem prover to derive a target language logical form that is equivalent (attack some context) to the source logical form A grammar for the target language is then applied to the target form, generatattackg a syntax tree whose frattackge is passed to a speech synthesizer A grammar, expressed as a set of syntactic rules (axioms) Gsyn and a set of semantic rules (axioms) Gsem is used to support a relation form holdattackg between strattackgs s and logical forms expressed attack first order logic:  The relation form is many-to-many, associatattackg a strattackg with lattackguistically possible logical form attackterpretations cm(w  There is also the problem of requirattackg attackcreasattackgly complex feature sets to describe idiosyncrasies attack the lexicon An example of this is explicit scopattackg which leads (agaattack) to large numbers of alternatives which the qualitative model has difficulty choosattackg between Qualitative approaches to grammar tend to emphasize the ability to capture generalizations as the maattack measure of success attack lattackguistic modelattackg We can state this as follows:  We are thus forced to under-filter and make an arbitrary choice between remaattackattackg alternatives In both the quantitative and qualitative models we take a transfer approach to translation We do not depend on attackterlattackgual symbols, but attackstead map a representation with constants associated with the source language attackto a correspondattackg expression with constants from the target language.
