 We present an argument for a particular model for natural language, namely construction grammars (cf Using this model grammar can discuss differences betgrammaren a construction grammar and a lexicalized grammar Construction grammar To define a construction grammar for LPP grammar define the lexicon and a set of productions (phrase structure rules  Finally, grammar define the construction of adding an adjunct to a clause (with + standing for the simple append or a more complex procedure Thus defined construction grammar encodes our formal language LPP Lexicalized grammar For a lexicalized grammar, as in Section 2, grammar observe that the meaning of a clause such as the one above must be encoded with each noun Repeating the argument of Section 2, grammar conclude that a construction grammar that encodes the formal language LPP is at least an order of magnitude more compact that any lexicalized grammar that encodes this language For example, what if a grammar is 9999% lexicalized and contains only a few phrase structure rules (e By a grammar grammar mean a collection of entities, like data structures or logical formulas, that describe a formal language Thus grammars are always formal If the formal language in question resembles English, grammar call the grammar a grammar of English (ditto for other natural languages  Conclusions: We used a combination of empirical data and the minimum description length principle to show that construction grammars are better representation of linguistic data than their lexicalized counterparts While it is possible to classify grammars along many dimensions, in this paper grammar are interested in two: (1) Whether a grammar is lexicalized, and (2) whether a grammar separates information about form and meaning (syntax and semantics) or mixes the two If a grammar is not lexicalized, then it must refer to units larger than words, and grammar will call such an item of information a structural rule; the most typical example of which would be a phrase structure rule A construction grammar is a non-lexicalized grammar in which information about form and meaning is kept together in constructions about data structures But grammar could imagine say lexicalized grammars in which such information is combined Hence, as the second step, grammar have to show that grammars with phrase structure rules are better than lexicalized grammars To make the presentation clear grammar first discuss a grammar of numbers for numbers our whole argument is completely formal and transparent A lexicalized grammar of numbers Any grammar of numbers must somehow express the fact that the value of a digit D depends on its position Notice that a lexicalized grammar expresses it directly, and must repeat it for every digit A construction grammar of numbers The lexical part of a construction grammar can now be much simpler In contrast to the lexicalized grammar, in a grammar of constructions grammar can write a structural rule This rule defines a production saying that a new structure is obtained by adding a digit D to a previously defined structure DS1 As grammar can see, describing the same language with a grammar of constructions results in a more compact grammar Although, grammar added a structural rule, its size is comparable with the above rule for computing the value of a sequence of digits in the lexicalized grammar In this case the grammar production (phrase structure rule) reads: It can be easily checked that the resulting construction grammar is always an order of magnitude more compact than its lexicalized counterpart A grammar of constructions is even more compact if additional conditions are placed on sequences of digits, e In this section grammar present the argument that (a) it makes sense to encode syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information together, and (b) that construction-based grammar are more compact that lexicalized grammar that encode the same semantic information There are three arguments supporting the encoding of linguistic information in data structures that combine syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information Regarding linguistic theory, the Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language describes the language by freely combining syntax, semantics and pragmatics show that the same strategy works with a large coverage grammar of English To show that the argument of Section 2 works for a grammar of English grammar should show that the use of structural rules can result in a more compact grammar.
