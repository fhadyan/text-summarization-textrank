 What makes (1) felicitous is that the pitch accents on the pronominals contribute attentional information that cannot be gleaned from text alone This suggests an attentional component to pitch accents, in addition to the propositional component explicated in Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg (1990  In this paper, I combine their account of pitch accent semantics with Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein's (1989) account of centering to yield insights into the phenomenon of pitch accented pronominals, and the attentional consequences of pitch accents in general catalogues six pitch accents, all combinations of high (H) and low (L) pitch targets, and structured as a main tone and an optional leading or trailing tone To explain how speakers move an entity in and out of the center of [mutual] attention, formalizes attentional operations with two computational structures the forward-looking center list (Cf) and the backward-looking center (the Cb  The corollaries for pitch accented pronominals are: (1) when a pitch accent is applied to a pronominal, its main effect is attentional, on the order of items in Cf; (2) the obligation to accent a pronominal for attentional reasons depends on the variance between felicitous the text predicts and felicitous the speaker would like to assert about the order of items in Cf These hypotheses arise from the following chain of assumptions: (1) To analyze the effects of pitch accents on pronominals, it is necessary to distinguish between attentional and propositional salience Attentional salience measures the degree to which an item is salient, expressible as a partial ordering, e In contrast, propositional salience, addressing an item's status in relation to mutual beliefs, is qualitative Both attentional (Cf) and propositional (mutual beliefs) structures are updated throughout Centering theories would be hard pressed to predict pitch accents on pronominals, on grounds of redundancy (2) Pitch accents on pronominals are primarily interpreted for felicitous they say about attentional salience Because nonpronominals contribute discourse content, pitch accented nonpronominals are mainly interpreted with respect to the mutual beliefs, that is, for their propositional content However, pronominals, with little intrinsic semantics, perform primarily an attentional function Therefore pitch accented pronominals are mainly interpreted with respect to Cf, for their attentional content (3) The specific attentional consequences of each pitch accent on pronominals can be extrapolated by analogy from the propositional interpretations in , by replacing mutual beliefs with Cf as the salient set (4) And therefore, the attentional effect of pitch accents can be formally expressed as an effect on the order of items in Cf From these assumptions, I derive the following attentional consequences for pitch accented pronominals: Only one pitch accent, L+H selects a Cb other than that predicted by centering theory and thereby reorders Cf By combining Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg's (1990) analysis of intonational meaning with Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein's (1989) theory of centering in discourse, the attentional affect of pitch accents becomes evident, and the paradox of pitch accented pronominals unravels.
