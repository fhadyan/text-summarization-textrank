 Recently, RD efforts involving machine translation of different language families, such as Japanese and English, have become popular , ,  The Multi-Level Translation Method has enabled a precise enumeration of conditions for the application of rules through detailed semantic categories Three Japanese verb phrases are changed into prepositional phrases in English ALT-J/E has, in addition to the semantic structure dictionary and semantic categories, introduced an analysis of the semantic categories of predicates which allows the supplemention of ellipses using the semantic relations between sentences The Japanese language generates new words (compound words) which are an amalgamation of a number of nouns, prefixes and suffixes (a characteristic of agglutinative languages  With conventional translation methods, registration of these compound words in the dictionary was an important issue for pre-processing ALT-J/E uses semantic categories to analyze compound words to find the semantic relationships of their constituents This function makes the translation of unknown compound words possible The experimental Japanese-to-English machine translation system ALT-J/E, based on the Multi-Level Translation Method, is currently being debugged Grading was conducted by outside company specialists in translation Based on the above results, we judge that with the Multi-Level Translation Method, a major step toward realization of a Japanese-to-English machine translation system requiring no pre-editing has been achieved This paper has presented the results of using the Multi-Level Translation Method, based on the Constructive Process Theory It has shown that the method enables a Japanese-to-English machine translation system to function effectively without manual pre-editing We call the limited use of semantic information used in the Multi-Level Translation Method meaning analysis Japanese-to-English machine translation has reached the stage where sentences that allow word-by-word transfer from Japanese to English, followed by assembly into the final sentence form (i where literal translation is possible can be translated by current technology Therefore, translations using existing systems require pre-editing to re-write the original Japanese sentences into a form that will enable application of the elementary compositional method, or in other words, a form that can undergo literal translation To go beyond the limits of conventional translation methods based on elementary compositionality, we have proposed the Multi-Level Translation Method, , , based on the Constructive Process Theory of Language , and have made the experimental system ALT-J/E, the Automatic Language Translator Japanese to English It is a method of translation which grasps the structure and meanings of expressions as a whole This knowledge is being used in analysis of the Japanese language and conversion of the Japanese into English The transfer method and the pivot method have been regarded as the methods most commonly used in machine translation  Thus, it would be difficult to apply this theory of computational linguistics to machine translation which deals with actual text, particularly to translation involving a pair of languages with different origins such as Japanese and English ALT-J/E has implemented the Multi-Level Translation Method with due consideration of the foregoing two points The translation process is outlined in Figure  Then any expressions whose predicates and arguments match an entry in the semantic pattern dictionary are translated as part of the Semantic Valency Transfer We classify these concepts as SEMANTIC CATEGORIES The semantic categories are ordered into two IS-A hierarchies These are the common noun semantic categories, some 2,800 categories (12 levels deep and the proper noun semantic categories, some 200 categories (9 levels deep  Based on this ontology, a semantic word dictionary was compiled with 400,000 index words The maximum number of semantic categories per word is 5 common noun categories and 10 proper noun categories The basic structure of Japanese sentences revolves mainly around predicates Each Japanese entry has an English translation As soon as the structure of the Japanese is determined in the source language analysis, the basic English structure can be determined from the English form structure in the semantic structure dictionary It has also become possible to translate typically Japanese expressions which were previously difficult to translate into English as well as to differentiate between translation of idiomatic expressions and general expressions.
