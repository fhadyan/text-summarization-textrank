 ALT-J/E uses semantic categories to analyze compound words to find the semantic relationships of their constituents This function makes the translation of unknown compound words possible The experimental Japanese-to-English machine translation system ALT-J/E, based on the Multi-Level Translation Method, is currently being debugged We call the limited use of semantic information used in the Multi-Level Translation Method meaning analysis We classify these concepts as SEMANTIC CATEGORIES The semantic categories are ordered into two IS-A hierarchies These are the common noun semantic categories, some 2,800 categories (12 levels deep and the proper noun semantic categories, some 200 categories (9 levels deep  The maximum number of semantic categories per word is 5 common noun categories and 10 proper noun categories The basic structure of Japanese sentences revolves mainly around predicates Each Japanese entry has an English translation As soon as the structure of the Japanese is determined in the source language analysis, the basic English structure can be determined from the English form structure in the semantic structure dictionary.
