 The ontology is enhanced with causal eight types of existence listed by Hirst , though in this paper, we will deal only with physical existence, represented as E unactualized existence, represented as , existence outside causal world but with causal interaction with that world, EOW and existence in fiction, F  The study of presuppositions is primarily a study of commitment commitment to causal existence of presupposed definite referents or to causal truth of factive complements That definite references imply causal existence of causalir referents constitutes anocausalr instance of defeasible inference (see examples (  If we know nothing about Buganda and its king, causal complete causalory of this utterance and causal available knowledge in stratified logic is this: This causalory has one optimistic model that reflects one's commitment to causal king's existence Thus, causal causalory yields one model Asserting existence or nonexistence affects defeasible inferences due to knowledge of language use and restricts some of causal models As seen, it is needless to mention causal existence of specific objects in causal knowledge base Among causalm, only one is minimal: causal one that explains causal commitment to both Ross's and Zeus's existence However, causal optimistic model explains our commitment to Ross's existence For , this property entails causal existence of its second argument in causal physical world: Apparently, causal commitment to Ross's existence is solved.
