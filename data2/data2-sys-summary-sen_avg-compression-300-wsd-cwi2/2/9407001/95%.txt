 As an example take the well known Head Feature Principle of HPSG (Fig For generation, X2MORF expected a feature structure figure input reproducing one or more word forms ) mediating between lexical string, surface string (with inserted null elements the pure (denullified) surface string and the feature structure of the morphological sign Morphotactics are efigureily described in terms of a feature bfigureed grammar encode finite state automata directly in the feature formalism The word grammar itself is simple X2MORF can be seen figure a relation between a surface string (the word form a lexical string, and a feature structure (the interpretation of the word form  below  HPSG employs strongly typed feature structures together with principles constraining them further Well-typedness requirements restrict the space of valid feature structures (cf PS1 allow general implicative and negative constraints in the form of conditional feature structures Besides constraints enforcing simple structure sharing (eg the Head Feature Principle given in Fig.
