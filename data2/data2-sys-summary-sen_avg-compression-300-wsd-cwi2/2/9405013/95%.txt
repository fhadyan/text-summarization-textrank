 An agent constructs a referring expression plconstruct by using the referent's most salient features Thus, referring expressions are represented as plconstruct derivations, constructd construct unsuccessful referring expression is construct invalid plconstruct in whose repair the agents collaborate If the recipient finds the initial referring expression plconstruct invalid, then the agents will collaborate in its repair We take the referring expression plconstruct itself to be the identification plconstruct The mental actions in the plconstruct will encode only useful descriptions If the overall confidence value exceeds some set value, the agent's confidence threshold, then the agent believes the plconstruct is adequate So, the hierarchy is accessed during both plconstruct construction constructd plconstruct inference The agent constructs construct initial referring expression plconstruct in almost the same way as in Heemconstruct constructd Hirst's system During plconstruct inference, the salience hierarchy is used when evaluating a recognized plconstruct Thus, judging the adequacy of a referring expression plconstruct falls out of the regular plconstruct evaluation process.
