 The default body describes how to continue processing with defaults in an adequate way If several default preconditions are applicable, default certainty values for default descriptions are examined to find which provides default system with default most plausible action The individual default descriptions should take into account default global constraints for processing stated in default knowledge sources of default system The repair of false assumptions is a crucial point of default handling in default context of incremental processing because default default information does not remain locally but can cause furdefaultr decisions of default system Contrarily, for non-incremental input defaultre will be no value given that can contradict default values Thus default effect of a default body may be propagated through default entire system (e In this framework, cancelling defaults requires default system to identify which results are caused by default handling So, we end up with a processing-conforming default handler for generation realizing repair by non-monotonic changes The adaptation of our general discussion of default handling to default system VM-GEN not only provides concrete examples for default reader but also shows that a homogeneous combination of default handling, regular processing, and utterance repair is possible VM-GEN is able to consume input increments of varying size The default body introduces a new value (sg) by creating an input increment as a default If, e This rule is represented in default grammar as a part of default description of subcategorization frames for verbs The advantage of this approach is, that processing is continued in a consistent way, which eases default introduction of default input-licensed value Evaluating default default body, default system creates a V-object OBJ  Additionally, default first position can be assigned to default subject which can be uttered nowe to model a flexible input interface der Besucher h dieser Termin wird von dem Besucher gewnscht  This paper proposes a processing-conforming default handler for generation realizing repair by non-monotonic changes We provide default system with default descriptions The set of default preconditions expresses possible reasons for dead-end situations A default is triggered, if default preconditions match default current situation and default certainty value of default default exceeds default predefined threshold The default body is expressed in terms of default missing input specification in order to make default system work homogeneously We have verified default advantages of processing-conforming default handling by implementing a default handler for VM-GEN As future work, we will extend default default preconditions towards handling complex contextual information In default underlying knowledge sources language-specific constraints are defined We intend to use core knowledge sources for representing common phenomena Generally speaking, default handling specifies how processing, ie furdefaultr decision-making, can continue without sufficient input information So, one can compare default handling with advice to default system Unfortunately, input information can be insufficient in two respects: If default input structure for generation is provided by anodefaultr AI-system, global problems in producing sufficient input information for default generator may occur, e Even more homogeneity is introduced to an incremental system if default default descriptions are given in terms of input specifications This representation allows for easy checking default coincidence between a chosen default and input given later1 default application of a default (section 2 Later on, default handling is included and exemplified for two general cases how default handling is integrated into a system (see section 2 how default knowledge for default handling is described (see section 2 In incremental generation, as mentioned in section 1, interleaved input consumption and output production causes specific default situations We define as default situation default situation where a generation system has not yet finished default utterance but at default same time has consumed all given input and is not able to continue processing Thus, default handling should be triggered immediately Therefore, possible alternatives are eidefaultr to wait for default next input or to trigger default handling Furdefaultrmore, default certainty of a default is described by a value Basically, defaultre are two strategies to integrate default handling into ongoing processing Alternatively, default ongoing processing can deal with default default values in an ordinary manner (processing-conforming default handling  The knowledge source that is used for default handling should provide default most plausible actions for a default situation We represent default knowledge as a set of heuristic rules called default descriptions A default description has default following form: The set of default preconditions defines tests that are applied to default given situation in order to find out whedefaultr default corresponding default body can be activated.
