 A frontier is an auxiliary frontier if the root and some frontier node (which becomes the foot node) have some non-empty SF value in common Initial frontiers are those that have no such frontier nodes In the frontiers shown, nodes detected as foot nodes are marked with  non-local distinction in HPSG cuts across the relations that are localized in TAG via the domains defined by elementary frontiers To allow for adjoining of auxiliary frontiers whose root and foot differ in their SFs, we could produce a number of different frontiers representing partial projections from each lexical anchor Consider T1 whose root and foot differ in their SFs It is determined which frontiers are auxiliary frontiers, and then the relationships between the SFs associated with the root and foot in these auxiliary frontiers are recorded However, immediately after applying a rule schema, the features at the bottom of a domination link are compared with the foot nodes of auxiliary frontiers that have differing SFs at foot and root Whenever the features are compatible with such a foot node, the SFs are raised according to the relationship between the root and foot of the auxiliary frontier in question to give to Sandy Given the greater expressive power of the HPSG formalism, it will not be possible to compile an aribitrary HPSG grammar into a TAG grammar This also provides a method for deriving the distinctions between initial and auxiliary frontiers, including the identification of foot nodes in auxiliary frontiers Next we describe the essential algorithm that determines the projection of frontiers from the lexicon, and give formal definitions of auxiliary frontier and foot node We do not assume atomic labelling of nodes, unlike traditional TAG, where the root and foot nodes of an auxiliary frontier are assumed to be labelled identically Adjoining separates them by introducing the path from the root to the foot node of an auxiliary frontier as a further specification of the underspecified domination link Add another node m dominating the root node of the instantiated schema Raising all SFs produces only fully saturated elementary frontiers and would require the root and foot of any auxiliary frontier to share all SFs, in order to be compatible with the SF values across any domination links where adjoining can take place Traditionally, in TAG, auxiliary frontiers are said to be minimal recursive structures that have a foot node (at the frontier) labelled identical to the root.
