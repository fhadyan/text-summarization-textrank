 A communication strategy is a strategy for communicating with another agent varying the cost of retrieval models different assumptions about memory Below we vary the relative cost of communication and retrieval To evaluate PERFORMANCE, we compare the Explicit-Warrant strategy with the All-Implicit strategy in situations where we vary the task requirements, agents' attentional capacity, and the cost of retrieval, inference and communication This section discusses the results of comparing the Explicit-Warrant communication strategy with the All-Implicit communication strategy to determine when each strategy is BENEFICIAL One strategy that supports deliberation is the Explicit-Warrant strategy, as in 0 Dialogues in which one or both agents use the Explicit-Warrant strategy are more efficient when retrieval has a cost Figure shows that the Explicit-Warrant strategy is DETRIMENTAL at AWM of 3,4,5 for the Standard task, in comparison with the All-Implicit strategy, if retrieval from memory is free (KS 3,4,5 ] 19, p [  This is because making the warrant salient displaces information about other pieces of furniture when agents are attention-limited However, figure shows that Explicit-Warrant is beneficial when retrieval is one tenth the cost of communication and inference23, p [  Other experiments show that even when the relative cost of retrieval is 0001, that Explicit-Warrant is still beneficial at AWM settings of 11 and 16 (KS for 11,16 ] 23 , p [ 23, p[  If communication is expensive compared to retrieval, communication cost can dominate the other benefits23 for AWM from 2 to 11, p [  The strategy virtually guarantees that the agents will agree on the reasons for carrying out a particular course of action23, p [  See figure  In other words, even when every extra WARRANT message incurs a penalty of 10 points, if the task is Zero-NonMatching-Beliefs, agents using Explicit-Warrant do better This paper has discussed an instance of a general problem in the design of conversational agents: when to include optional information when AWM is very limited and warrants are not required to be shared The method used here is a new experimental methodology for computational linguistics that supports testing hypotheses about beneficial communication strategies ,  Here we compared two communication strategies: All-Implicit and Explicit-Warrant He's Indian It's shorter Design-World agents can be parametrized as to communication strategy, and the effects of this strategy can be measured against a range of cognitive and task parameters This paper compares the Explicit-Warrant strategy to the All-Implicit strategy as strategies for supporting deliberation The Design-World experiments reported here compare the All-Implicit strategy with the Explicit-Warrant strategy Agents are parametrized for different communication strategies by placing different expansions of communication plans in their plan libraries The Explicit-Warrant strategy expands the PROPOSAL communication act to be a WARRANT followed by a PROPOSE utterance.
