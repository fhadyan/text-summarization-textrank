 This paper proposes a heuristic algorithm to determine the referential properties of noun phrases in a Japanese text As the above criteria are only meaningful for REFERENTIAL noun phrases, it is essential to determine whether the noun phrase is referential as a first step When it has been determined whether a noun phrase is definite or indefinite, then articles can be generated In the final stage of processing, if there is no determiner, definite noun phrases take the definite article the Indefinite countable singular noun phrases will take the indefinite article a/an, while indefinite countable plural and uncountable noun phrases will take the zero article  The countability and number of ASCRIPTIVE noun phrases matches that of their subject, and the countability and number of two appositive noun phrases match each other as described in , with the following proviso ALT-J/E makes the simplifying assumption that all ASCRIPTIVE noun phrases are indefinite Therefore, articles will be generated in the same way as for indefinite REFERENTIAL noun phrases Countable singular noun phrases will therefore take the indefinite article a/an, and countable plural and uncountable noun phrases will take the zero article  We tested the system on newspaper articles, in the articles tested, there were an average of 7 noun phrases in each sentence We then describe in detail a heuristic method for determining noun phrase reference in Japanese sentences 168 of the 717 noun phrases in the machine translation of the newspaper articles had some problem Setting these considerations aside, when we separate our results for noun phrase reference (counting as failures noun phrases with errors in article use, noun phrase reference or the use of possessive determiners and countability and number (counting as failures noun phrases with errors in number or countability our proposed algorithm gave success rates of 74% and 85% respectively Noun phrase reference is of fundamental importance in any discussion of meaning  The three way distinction in noun phrase reference is used as a base to determine a noun phrase's number and to generate appropriate articles and possessive pronouns when translating from Japanese to English Generic: Noun phrases with generic reference denote an entire class: e In English generic noun phrases can normally be expressed in three ways, as discussed in Section  Referential: Referential noun phrases are those that refer to some entity or entities in the discourse world: e Because ascriptive noun phrases are non-referring they cannot be the antecedent of other noun phrases If the definition of adjective phrase has been expanded to include ASCRIPTIVE noun phrases then our analysis is compatible They make no distinction between REFERENTIAL and ASCRIPTIVE for non-generic noun phrases In offer paper we use the term noun phrase reference to describe the relation between a noun phrase and what it stands for when it is used The algorithm used to determine the referential property of noun phrases headed by common nouns is shown in Figure  We distinguish between three uses of noun phrases, two referential and one non-referential that it is REFERENTIAL A noun phrase can be used to refer in two different ways: GENERIC where a noun phrase is used to refer to a whole class, and REFERENTIAL where a noun phrase refers to a particular entity or entities Recall that these rules are only applied if the noun phrase in question is headed by a common noun The next level of rules (level ) applies to noun phrases modified by embedded sentences This algorithm uses a simple heuristic: a noun phrase modified by a tensed embedded sentence is REFERENTIAL Note that only noun phrases modified by no judged to be genitive are REFERENTIAL Although ASCRIPTIVE noun phrases are non-referring, we will refer to all three uses under the general term of noun phrase reference Knowledge of a noun phrase's referential use is essential when translating from Japanese to English, as it plays a large part in determining how a noun phrase is expressed in English A GENERIC noun phrase (with a countable head noun) can generally be expressed in three ways  This three-way distinction of noun phrase reference was introduced in and used as a base to determine the countability and number of noun phrases in Japanese-to-English machine translation Noun phrases that cannot be used to show GENERIC reference are marked with an asterisk  Because the use of GEN is acceptable in all contexts, ALT-J/E generates all GENERIC noun phrases as such, that is as bare noun phrases The number of the noun phrase depends on the countability preference of the noun phrase heading it and there will be no article.
