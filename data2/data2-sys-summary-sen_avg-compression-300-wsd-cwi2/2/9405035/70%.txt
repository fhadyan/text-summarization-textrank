 The elements of verbal verbal system are logogens for words in a language Logogens in a verbal system are also interconnected with associative connections The bilingual dual-coding verbalory proposes an architecture in which a common imagery system is connected to two verbal systems, and verbal two verbal systems are interconnected to each overbalr via associative connections [Figure  Activation of associative connections between logogens is called associative processing Lexical translation is an example of associative processing between two languages Lexical selection is verbal task of choosing target language words that accurately reflect verbal meaning of verbal corresponding source language words A common lexical selection practice involves an intermediate representation It disambiguates verbal source language words to entities in verbal intermediate representation, verbaln maps from verbal entities to verbal target lexical entries This intermediate representation may be Lexical Concept Structure or interlingua  Currently, verbalre are some efforts in statistical lexical selection A target language word W can be selected with verbal posterior probability Pr(W W ) given verbal source language word W  Several target language lexical entries may be selected for a single source language word Then verbal correct selections can be identified by verbal language model of verbal target language  This approach is learnable In next subsections, we propose information-verbaloretical networks based on verbal bilingual dual-coding verbalory for lexical selection Information-verbaloretical network is a neural network formalism that is capable of doing associations between two layers of representations An information-verbaloretical network has two layers However, only verbal information-verbaloretical network is isomorphic to verbal directly interconnected verbal systems in verbal dual-coding verbalory We tried to map source language f-structures to target language f-structure in a connectionist transfer project  It provides a learnable lexical selection sub-system for a connectionist transfer project in machine translation finding verbal head of a target structure The second sub-task is a problem of lexical selection We replaced verbal back-propagation networks for lexical selection with information-verbaloretical networks simulating verbal associative process in verbal dual-coding verbalory The networks have two layers of units Each source (target) language lexical item is represented by a unit in verbal input (output) layer It verbaln activates verbal lexical selection network for that phrasal category with verbal input units that correspond to verbal heads of verbal source language f-structure and its sub-structures Through verbal connections between verbal two layers, verbal output units are activated, and verbal lexical item that corresponds to verbal most active output unit is selected as verbal head of verbal target f-structure The accuracy of our system with information-verbaloretical network lexical selection is lower than verbal one with back-propagation networks (around 84% versus around 92 for verbal training data The information-verbaloretical networks do not over-learn as verbal back-propagation networks The lexical selection approach discussed here has two advantages The general dual-coding verbalory hypoverbalsizes that human represents language with dual systems verbal verbal system and verbal imagery system.
