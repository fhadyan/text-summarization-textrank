 Unlike previous analyses, which postulate ambiguity of interpretation or derivation in the full clause source of the ellipsis, our analysis requires no such hidden ambiguity The antecedent or source clause is complete, whereas the target clause is missing (or contains only vestiges of) material found overtly in the source * John greeted every person that Bill did so ? John greeted every person that Bill did too Of course, not all elements in the target clause must be analyzed as parallel to some element in the source No empty adverbial modifier need be posited in the source clause; the instrumental modifies the target sentence directly We have proposed codifying the ellipsis interpretation problem using expressions equating terms that represent phrase meanings We know that the application of the property or relation to the parallel elements in the source constitutes the interpretation of the source clause Specifically, the interpretation of John greeted every person The resulting interpretation is that is, a sentence meaning free of undischarged assumptions Multiple property extraction: In some cases, a single sentence serves as the antecedent for two subsequent instances of ellipsis involving different parallel elements: John finished reading the poem before Bill did, and the short story too This sentence has a reading on which John finished reading both the poem and the short story before Bill finished reading the poem For instance, in the sentence John greeted every person when Bill did But in John greeted every person that Bill did There are many instances in which the interpretation of elided phrases does not correspond to the interpretation of a syntactic constituent in the source clause But VP ellipsis provides examples as well They are particularly problematic for identity-of-relations analyses in which the interpretation provided by the source clause corresponds to the translation of a syntactic constituent in the source It is important that ellipsis analyses (including the equational one outlined above) allow for ambiguity in the target clause, that is, for a set of relations to be made available by the source clause On an identity-of-relations analysis, such relations would be available only by virtue of their use in the derivation of the source clause interpretation This would necessitate the postulation of wild ambiguity in the source clause, one derivation for each possible case of subsequent ellipsis There exist many cases of multiple parallel elements in the source and target clause; it is very common for ellipsis to involve relations formed by abstraction of elements other than the interpretation of the subject noun phrase The consequence of this for theories where the relation available for interpretation of subsequent ellipsis must be available in the source sentence is, again, that every sentence which can be the antecedent for subsequent ellipsis must be many ways ambiguous; an interpretation must be available for each relation that might be needed to interpret ellipsis in subsequent discourse A single interpretation for the source clause can give rise to any required interpretation for the target, since there is no inherent restriction as to the number or nature of the parallel elements involved in the ellipsis197 A difficulty in any identity-of-relations analysis, which makes available only one interpretation for subsequent clauses exhibiting ellipsis, is seen when a single sentence is the antecedent for the ellipsis of two different noun phrases This sentence has a reading on which John finished reading both the poem and the short story before Bill finished reading the poem On this reading, the source for both elliptical clauses is the same clause, `John finished reading the poem To produce a relation which can be the interpretation for the elided VP whose subject is Bill, the interpretation for the sentence `John finished reading the poem' must be derived as: so as to make available the property  On the desired reading, the interpretation for `John finished reading the poem' must be derived as: Under an identity-of-relations analysis, the source clause is deemed ambiguous between the two derivations On our analysis, this reading is readily available John greeted every person when Bill did John greeted every person that Bill did We will take the source of the ellipsis in ( ) to be the clause `John greeted every person and the target to be `Bill did  The source clause is interpreted under a quantifier assumption generated by the subject NP That is, in an individual instance, the source clause is interpreted in one of several possible ways, leading to the use of a particular property in the interpretation; the property used in the target clause is identical to the corresponding property in the source clause Thus, the interpretation of the full sentence, with ellipsis resolved is The assumption may now be discharged, yielding the full interpretation This interpretation corresponds to a necessarily distributive reading, the `individual' reading, in which each person is simultaneously greeted by John and Bill Under this scenario, the interpretation of the source clause is The full sentence, then, is interpreted as where, again, the interpretation of the source clause is used to constrain the property P: The single value for Pis leading to the final interpretation This interpretation yields a `group' reading paraphrasable as `John greeted every person when Bill greeted every person The two derivations, then, correspond to just the interpretations noted by Sag We take the source clause to be the entire sentence, and the target to be, again, `Bill did  But in that case, the ellipsis equation will include the quantifier order manifest in the source clause interpretation, and this will be carried over to the target interpretation Under an identity-of-relations analysis, ambiguity of interpretation in a target clause comes about because the source clause is ambiguous To resolve the ellipsis, we need to set up an equation involving the interpretation of the parallel element in the source, every student  This interpretation only makes sense as part of the derivation of the meaning of the whole source clause However, only a single relation is available from the source clause in any given instance The equation admits of a strict interpretation for P: The meaning for the conjoined sentence before ellipsis resolution reduces, after ellipsis resolution, to which, following discharging of the quantifier assumption, becomes On this reading, Bill revises each student's paper after the student revises it On the first reading, John and Bill lost the same book; on the second reading, John and Bill each lost one of John's books, possibly distinct; and on the third reading Bill lost one of his own books Examples such as these illustrate that the subject of the source clause need not take widest scope in VP ellipsis Purely interpretive analyses , allow for multiple semantic interpretations arising from an unambiguous syntactic analysis of the source clause For the sentence `John revised his paper the unreduced meaning representation is one of: or corresponding to the strict and sloppy readings, respectively Thus, under this analysis, the second ellipsis, `and Bill did too would be uninterpretable (Recall that we are ignoring the readings in which the source for the second ellipsis is merely `John revised his paper  Nonetheless, if this were the meaning representation of the source of the second ellipsis, it would allow for a sloppy reading of the target; this would correspond to the sloppy reading (  It also allows for a third reading when used as the source for the second elliptical clause Our analysis produces six readings for the example sentence In Kamp's analysis, as in our own, ambiguities between strict and sloppy readings do not arise from ambiguity in the source clause; the source has only a single interpretation All of the analyses, however, share a reliance on semantic ambiguity in the source clause This reading is parallel to reading ( ) described above We eschew not only syntactic ambiguity in the source clause, but semantic ambiguity arising from any source, as a generator of the multiple readings of elliptical constructions The following issues are problematic for most analyses of ellipsis interpretation Our analysis of ellipsis resolution presupposes identification of the source of the ellipsis and the parallel structuring of the source and target Our analysis does not require that the property provided as the interpretation for the elided portion of the target clause in examples like those above correspond to the interpretation of any constituent in the source clause As described earlier, the problem of extracting a relation from the source clause can be stated equationally as In cases of VP ellipsis where the subjects of the source and target are parallel, the equation is simply P(s1) = s where s1 is the interpretation of the subject of the source clause Consider this sentence: John tried to kill himself before Bill did The second of these readings would not be obtainable given ( ) as the source clause meaning In cases where there are two pronouns coreferent with the parallel element in the source, one might expect that each pronoun would give rise to either a strict or a sloppy reading, giving a total of four readings for the target clause This property will serve to generate the interpretation of the target clause On the excluded reading, the source clause is John revised his paper before the teacher did and the target clause is Bill did too  John and Bill are the parallel elements The properties that are generated as solutions to the equation are predicated of the parallel elements in the target clause to generate the target clause interpretation Either of the other two remaining properties yields a possible interpretation of the target clause and George does too .
