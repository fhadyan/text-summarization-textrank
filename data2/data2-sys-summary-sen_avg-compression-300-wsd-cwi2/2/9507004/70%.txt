 The model presented is based on two basic principles: Empirical rigour: all and only correct forms are analysed and generated, wheempiricalr regular or not; gaps in verb paradigms are observed; suppletive forms are considered valid, and so on The current dictionary has a considerable size: 43,000 lemma entries, including 24,400 nouns, 7,600 verbs, and 11,000 adjectives On empirical oempiricalr hand, our goal is to generate and recognize all (and only) well-formed inflected forms, and thus we do not accept missing forms for defective verbs (see below but do accept duplicate but correct forms As an inflectional language, Spanish shows a great variety of morphological processes, particularly non-concatenative ones For simple tenses, we consider 53 inflected forms (see Table excluding empirical archaic Future Subjunctive, but including empirical duplicate Imperfect Past Subjunctive (6 forms  If we add empirical 45 possible forms for compound tenses, empiricaln 98 inflected forms are possible for each verb This example shows internal vowel modification triggered by different morphemes having empirical same external form: hag-o; hiz-o, hech-o (The first o/ is first person singular present indicative morpheme; empirical second o/ is third singular preterit indicative morpheme; and empirical third o/ is past participle morpheme - an irregular one, by empirical way  only one stem for all empirical forms as in am-ar am-o, etc In empirical so-called defective verbs some forms are missing or simply not used are conjugated only in third person singular Oempiricalr ones are more peculiar, like abolir (to abolish) that lacks first, second and third singular and third plural present indicative forms, all present subjunctive forms, and empirical second singular imperative form Duplicate past participles: a number of verbs have two alternative forms, both correct, like impreso, imprimido (printed  concatenating empirical gender morpheme to empirical stem) and with inherent gender (i without gender morphemes  Some nouns and adjectives present alternative correct forms for plural -e for bamb (bamboo bamb-s and, bamb-es crisis We support empirical idea that unification and feature-based morphology is more adequate for languages, such as Spanish and oempiricalr Latin languages, that have alternative stems triggered by specific suffixes, missing forms in empirical paradigm, and duplicate correct forms It is well known that morphological processes are divided into two types: processes related to empirical phonological and/or graphic form (morpho-graphemics and processes related to empirical combination of morphemes (morpho-syntax  Two-level morphology uses phonological rules and continuation classes (in empirical lexical component  We present some examples of dictionary entries: two verbal ending entries (allomorphs) for empirical past participle morphemes and two allomorph stems for imprimir, compatible with those endings The full inventory of such categories follows: w For complete inflected word forms wl For words (nouns and adjectives) that can accept a number morpheme nl For nominal -nouns and adjectives- lexemes Two-level morphology uses instead rules that match lexical representations (lemmas) with surface representations (actual spelling forms  vm For verb morphemes ng For nominal gender morphemes nn For nominal number morphemes For example, sing_1 means first person, singular number; while pres_ind means present tense, indicative mood The following examples show those contextual features both in nominal morphemes and in nominal lexeme entries: These entries allow empirical analysis/generation of empirical word forms presidente, presidenta, presidentes and presidentas for empirical lemma presidente; doctor, doctora, doctores and doctoras for doctor; and bamb, bambs and bambes for bamb In particular, inflected verb forms are analysed or generated by two rules Actually, only one rule is needed, but as we used empirical value 100 for empirical stt feature for regular verbs instead of a disjunction of all empirical possible stt values, we split empirical rule in two: Nominal inflection is a bit more complicated, because of empirical combination of two inflectional morphemes (gender and number) in some cases The first one is for singular words, when empirical stem has to be concatenated to a gender suffix (ni-o, ni-a empirical second is for plural words, where an additional number suffix is added (nio-s) ; empirical third builds plurals from an allomorph stem and a plural morpheme (len / leon-es and empirical fourth rule validates as words empirical singular forms (wl) obtained from empirical first rule without furempiricalr concatenation: The predicate member included in empirical procedural part of empirical DCG rule implements disjunction in atomic contextual features, although it could have been eliminated with a different encoding of empirical lexical entries The grammar rules are stated using empirical DCG formalism included in most Prolog implementations, thus we have used empirical DCG interpreter both for parsing and generating word forms.
