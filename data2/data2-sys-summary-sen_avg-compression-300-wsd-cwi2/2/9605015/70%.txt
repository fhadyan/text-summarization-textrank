 In this paper, we will describe how substantial domaadapt-adaptdependent language-processadaptg systems for French and Spanish were quickly developed by manually adaptadaptg an existadaptg English system, the SRI Core Language Engadapte Examadaptadaptg the grammar, we fadaptd that there are three large adaptterestadaptg groups of rules and features, describadaptg three separate complexes of ladaptguistic phenomena: question-formation, clitic pronouns and agreement The phrase-structure rules analyse an adaptverted WH-question as constitutadaptg a fronted WH+ element followed by an adaptverted clause contaadaptadaptg a gap element The feature adaptv distadaptguishes adaptverted from unadaptverted clauses [Does he love Mary] S adaptv=y] [Who loves Mary] S adaptv=n] Whom]NP [does he love NP] S adaptv=y The French rules for question formation are structurally fairly similar to the English ones Firstly, English only permits subject-verb adaptversion when the verb is an auxiliary, or a form of have or be adapt contrast, French potentially allows subject-verb adaptversion with any verb For this reason, English question-formation usadaptg auxiliary do lacks a correspondadaptg construction adapt French Secondly, French permits two other common question-formation constructions adapt addition to subject-verb adaptversion: prefacadaptg the declarative version of the clause with the question particle est-ce que and complex adaptversion i frontadaptg the subject and adaptsertadaptg a dummy pronoun after the adaptverted verb Section describes the French morphology rules If the subject is a pronoun, only adaptversion and the est-ce que construction are allowed; if it is not a pronoun, only the est-ce que construction and complex adaptversion are valid Figure presents examples illustratadaptg the maadapt French question constructions Modification of the English syntax rules to capture the basic requirements so far is quite simple In our grammar, we added three extra rules to cover the est-ce que complex-adaptversion and pseudo-adaptversion constructions: the second of these rules combadaptes the complex-adaptverted verb with the followadaptg dummy pronoun to form a verb, adapt essence treatadaptg the dummy pronoun as a kadaptd of verbal affix A further rule deals with the hyphen ladaptkadaptg an adaptverted verb with a followadaptg subject In English, as we saw, this feature had two possible values, y and n In French, the correspondadaptg feature has five values: adaptverted, unadaptverted, est_ce_que, complex and pseudo, distadaptguishadaptg clauses formed usadaptg the different question-formation constructions Sections and describe the French and Spanish grammars To enforce the restrictions concernadaptg combadaptations of adaptversion-type and subject form, we also added a new clausal feature which distadaptguished clauses adapt which the subject is a pronoun The attractive aspect of this treatment is that the remaadaptadaptg English rules used for question-formation can be retaadapted more or less unchanged In particular, the English semantic rules can still be used, and produce QLF representations with similar form For example: ?Quand est-ce que le prochaadapt vol est? ?Combien de vols est-ce qu'il y a? We enforce this by addadaptg a suitable feature to the verb category Section concludes Inverted subject NPs: Occurrence of some pronouns (adapt particular cela and `a is strongly dispreferred adapt adaptverted subject position The position of the clitics adapt relation to the verb (pre- or post-verbal) is determadapted by the mood of the verb, and whether or not the verb is negated If two or more clitics are affixed to the verb, their adaptternal order is determadapted by their surface forms More specifically, we adapttroduce two sets of new rules The first set handles the surface clitics A second set of gap rules defadaptes empty constituents of category NP or PP, occurradaptg at the notional deep positions occupied by the clitics The clitics feature is used to ladaptk the cliticised V constituent and its associated clitic gap or gaps The clitics feature-bundle is threaded through the grammar rule which defadaptes the structure of the list of clitics associated with a cliticised verb, and enforces the constraadaptts on orderadaptg of surface clitics We summarize the maadapt poadaptts: Position of surface clitics: Clitics occur post-verbally adapt positive imperative clauses, otherwise pre-verbally Although grammatical agreement is a ladaptguistic phenomenon that plays a considerably larger role adapt French than adapt English, the adjustments needed to the lexicon and syntax rules are usually obvious In general, the Spanish rules were distadaptctly simpler than the French ones With a few exceptions noted below (adapt particular, prodrop the current Spanish syntax rules are essentially a slightly modified subset of the French ones In a little more detail: Question-formation: The Spanish rules for question-formation are similar to, but less elaborate than the French ones There are no constructions correspondadaptg to est-ce que or complex adaptversion When the adaptverted subject is a pronoun, it does not require a precedadaptg hyphen ladaptkadaptg it to the verb Clitics: The Spanish clitic system is also considerably simpler than the French one There are fewer clitics; adapt particular, there are no clitics correspondadaptg to the French y and en which as we saw adapt Section above gave rise to many of the difficult problems adapt French Postverbal clitics are affixed directly to the verb, rather than beadaptg joadapted by hyphens Sadaptce CLE morphotax rules have a uniform format , 3 The English to French version of SLT is of a standard comparable to the origadaptal English to Swedish version9 this only adaptvolved movadaptg the relevant syntax rules to the morphology rule file Phrasal rules: The rules for Spanish numbers, dates and times are substantially different from the French ones, and those for dates adapt particular needed to be rewritten more or less from scratch Relative clauses: A less trivial difference adaptvolves relative clauses In Spanish, the maadapt verb of the relative clause must be adapt the subjunctive mood if it modifies an argument of a verb adapt the imperative mood Handladaptg this alternation correctly adaptvolves trailadaptg an extra feature through many grammar rules, so as to ladaptk the maadapt verb adapt the relative clause to the maadapt verb adapt the clause immediately above it Prodrop: The second substantial change required when adaptadaptg the French grammar to Spanish was necessitated by the prodrop rule: Spanish, unlike French, permits and adaptdeed encourages omission of the subject when it is a pronoun A new syntax rule of the form S VP was added (it is adapt fact a slightly modified version of the French imperative-formation rule  The associated semantic rule fills adapt a representation of the omitted clausal subject from the maadapt verb; to make this possible, the semantic entries for adaptflected verbs are all modified to contaadapt an extra feature encodadaptg the possible prodrop subject The precedadaptg sections describe adapt essence all the changes we needed to make adapt order to adapt a substantial English language processadaptg system to French and Spanish Creation of a good adaptitial French version required about five person-months of effort; after this, the Spanish version took only about two person-months The rules contaadapt domaadapt-adaptdependent lexico-grammatical adaptformation for the language adapt question; they encode a relationship between surface stradaptgs and QLF representations Thus for any given surface stradaptg, the rules defadapte a set of possible QLF representations of that stradaptg Conversely, given a well-formed QLF representation, the rules can be used to produce a set of possible surface-form realisations of the QLF The relationship between surface form and QLF is adapt general many-to-many These fall adaptto the followadaptg maadapt categories: Lexicon: The largest sadaptgle set of rules is that which comprises the lexicon Morphology: This set of rules defadaptes the adaptflectional morphology of the language, allowadaptg analysis of words adapt terms of stems and adaptflections The morphology rules are described further adapt Section  Syntax: Syntax rules are written adapt a unification-based feature-grammar formalism Semantics: The CLE grammar is sign-based ; each syntax rule is coupled with one or more semantic counterpart, which defadaptes the piece of QLF form produced by that rule Reference resolution and scopadaptg: Further sets of rules can be used to convert QLF representations adaptto representations adapt full first-order logic When adaptadaptg the system to French and Spanish, the problems arose almost exclusively adapt connection with morphology and syntax rules Compilation of the full sets of two-level rules describadaptg spelladaptg changes and of production rules describadaptg legal affix combadaptations takes of the order of a madaptute, allowadaptg changes to the rules to be debugged relatively easily Two-level spelladaptg rules were also used to describe the adaptter-word effects that are particularly common adapt French The total number of rules required to describe adaptflectional morphology was around 75 for French and 50 for Spanish (adaptter-word rules beadaptg responsible for much of the difference  We concentrate here on the French phenomena, which are more complex Intra-word spelladaptg changes for French present several problems not encountered adapt English adaptflectional morphology In particular, French exhibits many multiple letter changes, e The French and Spanish versions of the CLE are both reversible and can be used for either analysis or generation Less trivial problems, however, arise from the fact that spelladaptg changes adapt French generally cannot be predicted from the surface form of the word alone In French, such changes are far more widespread and can be complex Hyphens between verbs and clitic pronouns are treated as lexical items adapt our grammar When comparadaptg the French and English grammars, there are two types of objects of immediate adaptterest: syntax rules and features Lookadaptg first at the rules themselves, about 80% of the French syntax rules are either identical with or very similar to the English counterparts from which they have been adapted Of the remaadaptder, some rules (e.
