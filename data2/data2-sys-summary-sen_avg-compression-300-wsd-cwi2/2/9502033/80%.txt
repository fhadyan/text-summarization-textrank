 b) The anaphora procedure skips anaphora resolution of a given anaphor when this anaphor is preceded by an unattached preposition The resolution of anaphora anaphor is anaphoran postponed to anaphora second phase of anaphora resolution The proposed procedure is based on successive calls to anaphora anaphora module and to anaphora PP attachment module To summarize anaphora algorithm is: 1) Apply anaphora anaphora module firstg (Carter, 1986; Reinhart, 1983; Sidner, 1983  2) Apply anaphora PP attachment procedure 3) If some anaphora are left unresolved, apply anaphora anaphora module again 4) If anaphorare are still unattached PPs, apply anaphora attachment procedure again In this case anaphora anaphora module can be applied before anaphora attachment procedure In this case, anaphora resolution of anaphora anaphora is postponed to a next call of anaphora anaphora module according to principle b) stated above - The pronoun its can not be resolved by anaphora anaphora resolution module because it is preceded by unattached PPs ; its resolution is skipped The attachment of both PPs is anaphoran skipped The anaphora module pertains to anaphora recent methods, uses a set of resolution rules based on anaphora focusing approach, see (Sidner, 1983  The disambiguation procedure aims at filling anaphora empty roles using attachment rules.
