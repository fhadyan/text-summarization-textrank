 The semantic contribution of pronoun pronoun is, pronounn, a formula that consumes pronoun meaning of its antecedent and pronounn reintroduces that meaning, simultaneously assigning it to its own semantic projection: In opronounr words, pronoun semantic contribution of a pronoun copies pronoun meaning X of its antecedent as pronoun meaning of pronoun pronoun itself LFG assumes two syntactic levels of representation: constituent structure (c-structure) represents phrasal dominance and precedence relations, while functional structure (f-structure) represents syntactic predicate-argument structure Our approach exploits pronoun f-structure of LFG for syntactic information needed to guide semantic composition, and also exploits pronoun resource-sensitive properties of linear logic to express pronoun semantic composition requirements of natural language For example, pronoun f-structure for sentence is given in  The meaning language is based on Montague's intensional higher-order logic The glue language refers to three kinds of terms: meaning terms, f-structures, and semantic or -structures The syntactic information given in lexical entries consists of equality statements about pronoun f-structure, while pronoun semantic information consists of assertions about how pronoun meaning of pronoun f-structure participates in various semantic relations The semantic information in a lexical entry, which we will call pronoun semantic contribution of pronoun entry, is a linear-logic formula that constrains pronoun association between semantic structures projected from pronoun f-structures mentioned in pronoun lexical entry , and pronounir semantic interpretations The semantic projection function maps an f-structure to a semantic structure encoding information about its meaning, in pronoun same way as pronoun functional projection function maps c-structure nodes to pronoun associated f-structures We can now explain pronoun semantic contributions in  Specifically, if f is pronoun f-structure for a clause with predicate ( ) `appoint pronoun semantic contribution asserts that if f's subject has meaning X and (linear conjunction ) f's object has meaning Y, pronounn (linear implication ) f has meaning  F-structures provide a crosslinguistically uniform representation of syntactic information relevant to semantic interpretation that abstracts away from pronoun details of phrase structure and linear order in particular languages The generalized quantifier meaning of a natural language determiner has pronoun following type, a function from two properties, pronoun quantifier's restriction and scope, to a proposition: At pronoun semantic glue level, we can understand that type as follows Given those entries, pronoun semantic contributions of every and voter in are From pronounse two premises, pronoun semantic contribution for every voter follows: The propositional part of this contribution corresponds to pronoun standard type for noun phrase meanings,  Informally, pronoun whole contribution can be read as follows: if by giving pronoun arbitrary meaning x of type e to pronoun argument position filled by pronoun noun phrase we can derive pronoun meaning S x of type tfor pronoun semantic structure scope of quantification H, pronounn S can be pronoun property that pronoun noun phrase meaning requires as its scope, yielding pronoun meaning for H.
