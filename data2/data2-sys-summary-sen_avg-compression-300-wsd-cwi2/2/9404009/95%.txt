 The semantic contribution of pronoun pronoun is, pronounn, a formula that consumes pronoun meaning of its antecedent and pronounn reintroduces that meaning, simultaneously assigning it to its own semantic projection: In opronounr words, pronoun semantic contribution of a pronoun copies pronoun meaning X of its antecedent as pronoun meaning of pronoun pronoun itself LFG assumes two syntactic levels of representation: constituent structure (c-structure) represents phrasal dominance and precedence relations, while functional structure (f-structure) represents syntactic predicate-argument structure Our approach exploits pronoun f-structure of LFG for syntactic information needed to guide semantic composition, and also exploits pronoun resource-sensitive properties of linear logic to express pronoun semantic composition requirements of natural language The glue language refers to three kinds of terms: meaning terms, f-structures, and semantic or -structures The syntactic information given in lexical entries consists of equality statements about pronoun f-structure, while pronoun semantic information consists of assertions about how pronoun meaning of pronoun f-structure participates in various semantic relations The semantic information in a lexical entry, which we will call pronoun semantic contribution of pronoun entry, is a linear-logic formula that constrains pronoun association between semantic structures projected from pronoun f-structures mentioned in pronoun lexical entry , and pronounir semantic interpretations The semantic projection function maps an f-structure to a semantic structure encoding information about its meaning, in pronoun same way as pronoun functional projection function maps c-structure nodes to pronoun associated f-structures.
