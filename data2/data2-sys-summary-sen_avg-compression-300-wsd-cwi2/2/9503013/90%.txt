 The third possibility is suggested by considering representation semantic representations which are appropriate during a word by word parse This is essentially representation approach taken in Milward (1992) in order to provide complete, word by word, incremental interpretation using simple lexicalised grammars, such as a lexicalised version of formal dependency grammar and simple categorial grammar In processing representation sentence Mary introduced John to Susan, a word-by-word approach such as Milward (1992) provides representation following logical forms after representation corresponding sentence fragments are absorbed: Mary introduced John to Suex intr(mary,john,Mary \t\t PP(mary) Mary introduced \t\t xintr(mary,x,y) Mary introduced John \t\t yintr(mary,john,y) Mary introduced John to \t\t y For example, Mary introduced something to something is inappropriate if representation final sentence is Mary introduced noone to anybody Parse a new word, Wordi 2 representation universal quantifier is within representation scope of representation existential) whereas in sentence (b) representation preferred reading is where representation universal quantifier has scope over representation existential Scope preferences sometimes seem to be established before representation end of a sentence grammar, is for an inner scope reading for representation first quantifier In an incremental semantics, we would expect representation information state of an interpreter to be updated word by word Consider trying to perform threading in left-to-right order during interpretation of representation sentence, John left if Mary left Now consider processing if Mary left In representation present implementation, semantic structures (akin to logical forms) are built word by word, and each structure is representationn evaluated independently using a dynamic semantics (with threading performed according to representation structure of representation logical form  The paper described some potential applications of incremental interpretation Finally, it argued that representation apparently close relationship between representation states used in incremental semantics and dynamic semantics fails to hold below representation sentence level, and briefly presented a more indirect way of using dynamic semantics in incremental interpretation lambda expressions) word by word Traditional layered models of sentence processing first build a full syntax tree for a sentence, and representationn extract a semantic representation from this Incremental interpretation allows on-line semantic filtering, i Both Categorial approaches to incremental interpretation and approaches which use partial syntax trees get into difficulty in cases of left recursion Consider representation sentence fragment, Mary thinks John A possible partial syntax tree is provided by Fig John could also be embedded within a sentence which has a sentence modifier requiring its own s node e However, on-line semantic filtering for sentence processing does have drawbacks Resnik 1992  To enable complete, fully word by word parsing requires a way of encoding an infinite number of partial trees Semantic representations could be formed word by word by extracting `default' syntax trees (by strengrepresentationning dominance links into immediated dominance links wherever possible .
