 Those observations are summarised below e2 can precede e1 if 2 describes an event, or 1 doesn't describe an activity and 2 describes a past perfect stative Using preferences, we reduce that to 2 readings for each continuation The correct temporal relations are shown in vvg John fell We presented a brief description of an algorithm for determining the temporal structure of discourse \t\tbe She was building a dog house  The main advantage of this approach is that it reduces temporal structure ambiguity without having to rely on detailed world knowledge postulates We constrain S2 in this way because of lack of space; additional constraints are given in e the temporal focus of S1, here referred to as TF1 He had lost the key Hannah opened the door t\tb Consider: 9 a \t\tb For the problem with multi-sentence discourses, and the threads that sentences continue, we use an implementation of temporal centering ,  Kameyama et al (1993) confirmed these preferences when testing their ideas on the Brown corpus As an example of how the temporal centering preference techniques can reduce ambiguity, recall example pp and the possible continuations shown in pp2 In example ( ) with the second thread RHET/SMALL&gt RELN: The relation between this DCU and a previous one Lexical items and phrases such as cue words (stored in CUE/SMALL&gt WORD) affect the value of this slot TEMPFOC: The most recent event in the current thread which a subsequent eventuality may elaborate upon (same-event overlap, come just_after or precede TENASP: Keeps track of the tense and syntactic aspect of the (if the is simple  It consists of two parts, the constraint-based portion and the preference-based portion: 1 The possible temporal/rhetorical relations are constrained (b) Lexical items such as cue words influence the value of the RHET/SMALL&gt RELN type (See Figure 1  If more than one possibility exists, semantic preferences are used to choose between the possibilities.
