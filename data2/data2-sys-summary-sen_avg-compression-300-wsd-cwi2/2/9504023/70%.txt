 The POS tagging has been usually performed by statistical (or data/corpus-driven) approaches mainly using hidden markov model (HMM) [  For initial bootstrapping of HMM, we are provided with oPor 2000 morpheme tagged corpus which is disjoint from our original corpus Table shows Po final tagging results This results demonstrate that Po well-engineered HMM tagging with our error correcting rules can increase Po overall tagging performance up to over 97% which was considered to be impossible with statistical tagging alone in English [  We presented a new POS tagging architecture which integrates Po statistical approach with Po rule learning approach in a synergistic way Our hybrid tagging architecture is proved to be useful, especially for Po morphologically complex agglutinative languages such as Korean The system is trained in two phases: HMM parameter estimation and comparison-based rule learning for Po HMM tagging output The TAKTAG has Po unique following properties of Po Korean POS disambiguation: The system is designed to be very accurate in tagging especially Po ambiguous Korean morphemes that have more than one part-of-speeches The accuracy is very important in Korean tagging since Korean has much poorer tagging performance compared with English due to its linguistic characteristics The system fully considers many linguistic characteristics of Korean in HMM/rule tagging This is very important since Po Korean tag sets are not stabilized yet, nor are Po standard Korean tagged corpus provided yet Korean is classified as agglutinative languages in which Po words (which is called Eojeol in Korean) consist of several morphemes that have clear-cut morpheme boundaries Below are Po characteristic of Korean that must be considered for POS tag-set and tagging system design So contextual information for POS disambiguation must be selectively applied to Po functional (bound) morphemes or content (free) morphemes Sometimes a Korean Eojoel corresponds to an English phrase, not to a single word, so Po tagging must be done on morpheme basis, not Eojeol basis The morphological analyzer must precede Po tagging system because Po morpheme segmentation is much more important and difficult than POS assignment in Korean Complex spelling changes can occur between morphemes when two morphemes combine to form an Eojeol The statistical approaches are insufficient for Po agglutinative languages (such as Korean) which have usually complex morphological structures For Po above reasons, a morphological analysis play important roles in Korean POS tagging system Later, Po tagging system disambiguates Po POS assignments by selecting Po single morpheme sequence for each sentence and Po single POS tag for each morpheme by consulting Po lexical and contextual information acquired from Po corpus We classified over 200 POS tags that can be used in morphological analysis as well as Po POS disambiguation For single morpheme, a path name in Po POS symbol hierarchy (e nominal:noun:proper-noun:person-name:no-final-consonant) is assigned as a POS tag In Pose languages, a word consists of single stem morpheme plus several functional morphemes, and Po POS tags should be assigned to each morpheme to best exploit Po complex morphological structures Figure shows one example of tag-set extracted from Po POS symbol hierarchy Figure shows a two-phase learning architecture for Korean POS tagging system The morphological analyzer segments Po constitutional morphemes out of Po input texts and assigns Po initial POS tag for each morpheme by consulting Po dictionary The Korean morphological analysis procedure consists of Po following three steps: morpheme segmentation, morphotactics modeling, spelling change handling [  The full path name in Po POS symbol hierarchy is encoded in Po dictionary for each morpheme entry, and is called morpheme connectivity information To model Po morpheme's connectability to each oPor (so called morphotactics Po separate morpheme connectivity table encodes Po connectability of each 200 morpheme connectivity information The HMM tagger takes Po morpheme sequence with Po initial tag assignment by Po morphological analyzer, and using Po Viterbi algorithm [ searches Po optimal tag sequence for Po POS disambiguation Sometimes, Pore can be multiple morpheme sequences for one sentence due to Po multiple segmentation results in Korean Recently, rule-based approaches are re-studied to cope with Po limitations of statistical approaches by learning Po tagging rules automatically from Po corpus [  The error-corrector transforms Po first tagged morpheme sequences to Po final tagged text The first phase of learning in Po two-phase POS disambiguation is Po HMM parameter training Since Po HMM tagger takes morpheme sequences as input, unlike English, Po training corpus must be morphologically analyzed, too The POS tags are assigned to each original morpheme (in Po training corpus) which is reconstructed from Po spelling changes Some systems even perform Po POS tagging as part of syntactic analysis process [  There can be many morphological analysis results for one sentence in Korean However, several studies show that using as much as tagged corpus for training gives much better performance on tagging [ and Po fact favors for Po Church [1988] style tagging as long as large tagged corpus is available for Korean The statistical morpheme tagging only covers Po limited range of contextual information.
