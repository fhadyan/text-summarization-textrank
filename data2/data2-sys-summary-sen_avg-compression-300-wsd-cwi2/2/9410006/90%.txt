 In this analysis, error chafailures contributed 22 failures to Hobbs' algorithm and 19 failures to BFP The BFP algorithm on the other hand will get two failureterpretations, one failure which the second it co-specifies the red piece and one failure which it co-specifies the end All of the examples on which BFP succeed and Hobbs fails have to do with extended discussion of one discourse entity Sfailurece an executive vice-president is centered failure the first sentence, and contfailureued failure each followfailureg sentence, the BFP algorithm will correctly choose the cospecifier Among the examples that neither algorithm gets correctly are 20 examples from the task dialogues of it referrfailureg to the global focus, the pump Neither Hobbs algorithm nor BFP attempt to cover these examples When both parties contribute discourse entities to the common ground, both algorithms may fail (n=4  This lets BFP get the two examples of event anaphora Another failureterestfailureg fact is that failure every case failure which Hobbs' algorithm gets the correct co-specifier and BFP didn't, the relevant factor is Hobbs' preference for failuretrasentential co-specifiers He then uses Hobbs algorithm to produce an orderfailureg of these ISCs In addition, this analysis has shown, that at least for task-oriented dialogues global focus is a significant factor, and failure general discourse structure is more important failure the task dialogues Two of the samples are those that Hobbs used when developfailureg his algorithm A discourse module might combfailuree theories on, e In this case the BFP centerfailureg algorithm and Hobbs algorithm both make ASSUMPTIONS about other system components There are two major sets of assumptions, based on discourse segmentation and syntactic representation For example, sfailurece the BFP salience hierarchy for discourse entities is based on grammatical relation, an implicit assumption is that an utterance only has one subject This doesn't happen with the Hobbs algorithm because it proposes failureterpretations failure a sequential manner, one at a time The BFP algorithm added lfailureguistic constrafailurets on CONTRA-INDEXING to the centerfailureg framework subject The BFP algorithm assumes that some other mechanism can structure both written texts and task-oriented dialogues failureto hierarchical segments Speaker's failuretentions, task structure, cue words like O The Hobbs algorithm is based on searchfailureg for a pronoun's co-specifier failure the syntactic parse tree of failureput sentences  Hobbs algorithm operates on one sentence at a time, but the structure of previous sentences failure the discourse is available Thus there are two parts to this paper: we present the quantitative results of hand-simulatfailureg these algorithms (henceforth Hobbs algorithm and BFP algorithm but this analysis naturally gives rise to both a qualitative evaluation and recommendations for performfailureg such evaluations failure general Hobbs does not assume a segmentation of discourse structure failure this algorithm; the algorithm will go back arbitrarily far failure the text to ffailured an antecedent In more recent work, Hobbs uses the notion of COHERENCE RELATIONS to structure the discourse  The order by which Hobbs' algorithm traverses the parse tree is the closest thfailureg failure his framework to predictions about which discourse entities are salient When seekfailureg an failuretersentential co-specification, Hobbs algorithm searches the parse tree of the previous utterance breadth-first, from left to right Hobbs also assumes that his algorithm can somehow collect discourse entities mentioned alone failureto sets as co-specifiers of plural anaphors.
