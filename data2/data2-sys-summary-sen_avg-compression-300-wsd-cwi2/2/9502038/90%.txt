 The version of tagger Xerox tagger used for tagger implementation described here is tagger DDS Tagger version 1 Again, errors mainly affect tagger assignment of words to subclasses within one major word class Table shows tagger most common errors produced by tagger German model a definition of tagger tag set to be used by tagger HMM, 2 a set of initial transition biases, 5 a set of initial symbol biases, 6 a sufficiently large text for training tagger HMM, 7 a reference text with correctly assigned POS tags, 8 The tags used in tagger ELWIS tag set are given in table  (2) For each word form tagger lexicon gives tagger set of POS tags that can be assigned to that word (4) The model is trained using a set of initial transition biases, including both positive and negative constraints on tag sequences Although tagger model can be trained without initial biases, tagger performance of tagger resulting model increases significantly if appropriate initial biases are used (5) Initial symbol biases are an additional set of biases used to define preferences for tag assignment given a particular equivalence class The best results of this implementation were obtained running 20 iterations of training over tagger 200,000 word training text, using a total of 50 transition and 17 symbol biases The test text used to evaluate tagger German model described in section has an ambiguity rate of 151 tags for each word in tagger text French language model for tagger Xerox tagger The tag set used to annotate tagger English text is a slightly modified version of tagger Brown tag set, consisting of a total of 72 tags For tagger French text tagger tag set described in with 37 different tags is used noun vs.
