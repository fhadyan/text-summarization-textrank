 Now, they have to memorize only one scheme of tag classes (class names, class semantics, exceptions as opposed to several schemes for several corpora before The tool described in this paper performs tagset mapping with manually written rules to introduce a standardised morphosyntactic tagset As a formal grammar is used to define syntactically well-formed specifications of word forms, we can regard our standard tagset as a specification language Mapping tags of an existing, flat-labeled tagset or source annotation scheme to tags of a specification language (target annotation scheme) is an instance of the retagging problem In the latter case, the physical tagset makes finer distinctions than the target annotation scheme Unfortunately, what we usually find in the mapping business is a mixture of two more problematic cases: The physical tagset cannot support a distinction intended by the specification language, e In the example case, the source annotation scheme includes special indefinite pronouns like anybody into the normal common nouns, whereas some word forms (color) are (wrongly tagged as adjectives in the source annotation scheme but as common nouns in the target annotation scheme We opted for symbolic mapping rules and designed two kinds of mapping rules to deal with the discrepancies indicated above Class coverage rules describe a correspondence of source and target annotation classes The word forms that are annotated with the physical tag NN are common singular nouns or mass nouns in the terms of the specification language their standard mapping can be overridden in fig The exception lexicon lookup takes place after the mapping of the class coverages After the compilation of the mapping rules, the system keeps the information in a data structure called an MTree (mapping tree see fig There is an MTree for each physical tagset regarded nondisjunctiveness of classes: A target annotation class has several source annotation correspondences In fig With a standardised tagset, linguistic information from different corpora of the same language can be reused and thus merged into a large data base System support includes Compilation of the tagset definition: useful for tagsets with many non-hierarchical, i combinatory features (which would have to be multiplied out manually otherwise Compilation of mapping rules: consistency checks (cf section  For test purposes, we wrote mapping rules for the UPenn and SUSANNE tagsets Information input are tagging guidelines, if the source annotation scheme comes with a comprehensive description of the intended class semantics, or corpus queries otherwise, which is more time consuming.
