 A heritage structure can be described by two types from different hierarchies, but there need not be a common subtype of these two types In case of multiple inheritance, a type can inherit different heritages from its supertypes in different dimensions In Carpenter's system, the value of a heritage has one type as the type restriction, whereas in our system, the type restriction can be a conjunction of types from different dimensions Multi-dimensional type hierarchies have the favourable property that the types can be compiled to a Prolog term representation Feature: The term representation has an argument position for each heritage introduced for a type.
