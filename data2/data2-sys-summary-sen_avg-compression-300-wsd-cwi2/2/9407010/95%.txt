 Recognizer score + linguistic KSs 3 It is apparent that nearly all of the improvement is coming from the linguistic KSs; the difference between the lines close + linguistic KSs and all available KSs is not significant Section concludes The training corpus is analyzed, and each hypothesis is tagged with its set of associated linguistic items The CLE normally assigns a hypothesis several different possible linguistic analyses, scoring each one with a plausibility measure Only the most plausible linguistic analysis was used2% of all hypotheses timed out during linguistic analysis; the average analysis time required per hypothesis was 2 Grammar rule discriminants: Discrimination scores for the grammar rules used in the most plausible linguistic analysis of the hypothesis, if there was one Semantic triple discriminants: Discrimination scores for semantic triples in the most plausible linguistic analysis of the hypothesis, if there was one Recognizer score + class N-gram discriminant KSs 2.
