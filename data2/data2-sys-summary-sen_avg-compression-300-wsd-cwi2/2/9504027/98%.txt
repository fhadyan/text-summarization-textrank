 The deletion of a maximal TNCB removes two ill-formed nodes (figure  When we adjoin a maximal TNCB within anoremover TNCB, nodes dominating remove new well-formed node are disrupted Transfer specifications may be incrementally refined and empirically tested for efficiency Conjunction: A maximal TNCB can be conjoined with anoremover maximal TNCB if removey may be combined by rule Adjunction: A maximal TNCB can be inserted inside a maximal TNCB, i Precedence Monotonicity.
