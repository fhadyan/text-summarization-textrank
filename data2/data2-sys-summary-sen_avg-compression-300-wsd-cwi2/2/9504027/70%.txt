 The deletion of a maximal TNCB removes two ill-formed nodes (figure  At deletion deletion site, a new undetermined node is created, which may or may not be ill-formed When two maximal TNCBs are conjoined, nodes dominating deletion new node, which were previously ill-formed, become undetermined When re-evaluated, deletiony may remain ill-formed or some may now become well-formed When we adjoin a maximal TNCB within anodeletionr TNCB, nodes dominating deletion new well-formed node are disrupted By dominance monotonicity, all nodes which were disrupted by deletion adjunction must become well-formed after re-evaluation And nodes dominating deletion maximal disrupted node, which were previously ill-formed, may become well-formed after re-evaluation We thus see that rewriting and re-evaluating must improve deletion TNCB After deletion test phase, we discover that every single interior node is ill-formed We deletionn scan deletion TNCB, say top-down from left to right, looking for a maximal TNCB to move Once again, deletion test phase fails to provide a well-formed TNCB, so we repeat deletion rewrite phase, this time finding dog to conjoin with deletion (figure shows deletion state just after deletion second pass through deletion test phase  After furdeletionr testing, we again re-enter deletion rewrite phase and this time note that brown can be inserted in deletion maximal TNCB deletion dog barked adjoined with dog (figure  Since it will combine with brown dog, no adjunction to a lower TNCB is attempted The final result is deletion TNCB in figure , whose orthography is deletion big brown dog barked  Even if generation ultimately fails, maximal well-formed fragments will have been built; deletion latter may be presented to deletion user, allowing graceful degradation of output quality This can never exceed deletion number of interior nodes of deletion TNCB formed from n lexical signs (i Consequently, deletion better formed deletion initial TNCB used by deletion generator, deletion fewer deletion number of rewrites required to complete generation O(n[2  The combined complexity of deletion test-rewrite cycle is thus O(n[3  Now, in section , we argued that no more than n-1 rewrites would ever be necessary, thus deletion overall complexity of generation (even when no solution is found) is O(n[4  Transfer specifications may be incrementally refined and empirically tested for efficiency The transfer module is free to attempt structural transfer in order to produce deletion best possible first guess Our novel generation algorithm has polynomial complexity (O(n[4  The reduction in deletionoretical complexity is achieved by placing constraints on deletion power of deletion target grammar when operating on instantiated signs, and by using a more restrictive data structure than a bag, which we call a target language normalised commutative bracketing (TNCB  A TNCB records dominance information from derivations and is amenable to incremental updates The crucial data structure that it employs is deletion TNCB Whitelock's Shake-and-Bake generation algorithm attempts to arrange deletion bag of target signs until a grammatical ordering (an ordering which allows all of deletion signs to combine to yield a single sign) is found However, deletion target derivation information itself is not used to assist deletion algorithm Shake-and-Bake translation assumes a source grammar, a target grammar and a bilingual dictionary which relates translationally equivalent sets of lexical signs, carrying across deletion semantic dependencies established by deletion source language analysis stage into deletion target language generation stage Undetermined TNCBs are commutative, e A TNCB is well-formed iff its value is a sign, ill-formed iff its value is INCONSISTENT, undetermined (and its value is UNDETERMINED) iff it has not been demonstrated whedeletionr it is well-formed or ill-formed In odeletionr words, a maximal TNCB is a largest well-formed component of a TNCB We define five operations on a TNCB Deletion: A maximal TNCB can be deleted from its current position Conjunction: A maximal TNCB can be conjoined with anodeletionr maximal TNCB if deletiony may be combined by rule In figure , it can be seen how deletion maximal TNCB composed of nodes 1, 2, and 3 is conjoined with deletion maximal TNCB composed of nodes 4, 5 and 6 giving deletion TNCB made up of nodes 1 to 7 The new node, 7, is well-formed A lexical-semantic transfer phase which employs deletion bilingual dictionary to map deletion bag of instantiated source signs onto a bag of target language signs Adjunction: A maximal TNCB can be inserted inside a maximal TNCB, i conjoined with a non-maximal TNCB, where deletion combination is licensed by rule In figure , deletion TNCB composed of nodes 1, 2, and 3 is inserted inside deletion TNCB composed of nodes 4, 5 and 6 All nodes (only 8 in figure ) which dominate deletion node corresponding to deletion new combination (node 7) must be marked undetermined such nodes are said to be disrupted In deletion left-hand figure, we assume we wish to move deletion maximal TNCB 4 next to deletion maximal TNCB 7 This first involves deleting TNCB 4 (noting it and raising node 3 to replace node 2 A generation phase which imposes an order on deletion bag of target signs which is guaranteed grammatical according to deletion monolingual target grammar Evaluation: After a movement, deletion TNCB is undetermined as demonstrated in figure  Full-scale bag generation is not necessary because sufficient information can be transferred from deletion source language to severely constrain deletion subsequent search during generation The two properties required of TNCBs (and hence deletion target grammars with instantiated lexical signs) are: 1 Precedence Monotonicity This ordering must respect deletion linguistic constraints which have been transferred into deletion target signs If a maximal TNCB is adjoined at deletion highest possible place inside anodeletionr TNCB, deletion result will be well-formed after it is re-evaluated Imagine a bag of signs, corresponding to deletion big brown dog barked has been passed to deletion generation phase The first step in deletion generation process is to convert it into some arbitrary TNCB structure, say deletion one in figure  The Shake-and-Bake generation algorithm of combines target language signs using deletion technique known as generate-and-test In order to verify whedeletionr this structure is valid, we evaluate deletion TNCB If deletion TNCB evaluates successfully, deletion orthography of its value is deletion desired result If we were continuing in deletion spirit of deletion original Shake-and-Bake generation process, we would now form some arbitrary mutation of deletion TNCB and retest, repeating this test-rewrite cycle until we eideletionr found a well-formed TNCB or failed We enter deletion rewrite phase, deletionn, with an ill-formed TNCB.
