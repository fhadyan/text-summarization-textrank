 However, while the linguistic structure organizes the verbatim content of discourse segments, the intentional structure contains only the intentions that underlie each segment The supposition of an intentional structure explains how discourse coherence is preserved in the absence of a complete history of the discourse They illustrate, form, the hypothesis that certain of the discourse markers are more likely to betoken certain focusing operations The most useful prosodic correlates of discourse segmentation occur at segment boundaries and indicate either the opening of a new segment, closure of the old or both Rather, discourse participants summarize the verbatim contents of a discourse segment by the discourse intention it satisfiesg Um, uh) and unfilled pauses appear at segment boundaries but are also found within a discourse segment and in the smaller groupings it contains As corroborators of attentional interpretations of cue phrases filled pauses are less useful than unfilled pauses because they overlap with cue phrases in both form (partially lexicalized) and function My investigation is inspired by the theory relating attentions, intentions and discourse structure GROSZ-SIDNER  To the more specific observations linking cue phrases to attentional state GROSZ-SIDNER SCHIFFRIN and the duration of unfilled pauses to increased cognitive difficulty GOLDMAN-EISLER-1 I add the assumption of four fundamental focusing operations Together, they motivate my hypotheses that: (1)Specific cue phrases betoken specific focusing operations Thus, I expected to find in my discourse samples the following correlations: Unfilled pause duration and focusing operation are correlated Cue phrases are correlated with focusing operations The discourse intention of greatest scope is the Discourse Purpose (DP the reason for initiating a discourse2 Cue phrase type and unfilled pause duration are correlated as well Pause duration is positively correlated with the number of segments affected in one focusing operation Within this, discourse segments are introduced to fulfill a particular Discourse Segment Purpose (DSP) and thereby contribute to the satisfaction of the overall DP I analyzed two discourse samples three minutes of a directions discourse and seven minutes of a manager-employee project meeting campus The discourse takes the form of an expert-client dialogue The search for correlations among cue phrases, unfilled pauses and discourse structure generated three data collection tasks: Identification of cue phrases; Identification and measurement of unfilled pauses; Segmentation of the discourse via the identification of the focusing operations that effected the segmentation The main challenge of cue phrase identification lay in distinguishing cue from non-cue uses of a phrase An accurate discourse segmentation falls out of an accurate classification of the focusing operations by which the segments have been constructed The segmentation of a completed discourse is equivalently the task of recapturing the attentional state that accompanied each successive utterance Attentional cues are especially important because topical relations do not always predict discourse structure Segmentation of a completed discourse is most straightforward for expository text In such discourse, domain and attentional hierarchies often coincide the relations among segments and of each segment to the overall Discourse Purpose are clear Even in the task-oriented directions discourse, the relations among steps in the task did not conclusively determine the relations of the discourse segments in which these steps were described The particular segmentation difficulties presented by my sample(s) led to the development of explicit criteria for isolating the corroborating features of attentional operations and discourse structure In prepared discourse (written or spoken) the intentional structure is tightly coupled to the Discourse Purpose Their relation to the discourse in which they occur illustrates the difficulty of segmenting in hindsight a discourse whose DSPs may satisfy multiple DPs This recommends against reliance on domain knowledge, since one discourse may invoke more than one domain The underspecified nature of cue phrase correspondences to focusing operations is discussed in Section 5 The global focus of attention encompasses those entities relevant to the discourse segment currently under construction, while the local focus (also called the center CENTERING is the currently most salient entity in the discourse segmentg phrase-final lowering, phrase-initial pitch range expansion) can felicitously indicate more than one focusing operation; second, the intonation at a phrase boundary often indicates stack primitives (push, pop, null) more reliably than the composite focusing operations from which discourse structure is deduced For example, in the directions discourse, the cue phrases So, But and And often indicated pops, as did the prosodic changes that accompanied them, e The local focus may change from utterance to utterance, while the global focus (ie current context) changes only from segment to segment The co-occurring focusing operation The discourse function of the immediately prior speech (cue phrase, acknowledgment, closure, filled pause, repair, topical but none of the above  The discourse function of the immediately subsequent speech (same categories as for prior speech  The segmentation of the discourse was reconstructed according to the focusing operations indicated both lexically and acoustically The segmentation described a discourse with two top level segments In particular, the attentional state describes the processing of the discourse segment which has been introduced to satisfy the current discourse intention The functional interrelation is expressed temporally in spoken discourse the linguistic, intentional and attentional components devoted to one DSP co-occur To compensate for the small sample sizes of the cue phrase data, all explicit lexical markers of structure (cue phrase, acknowledgment, filled pause) were collapsed into the category, marked The average duration for pauses preceding a marked focusing operation was 058, p =  These findings begin to distinguish the focusing operations quantitatively, by number of focus spaces affected, and qualitatively, by whether they occur within an established context (Initiate, Retain, Return) or at its beginning (Replace  For each focusing operation, the difference between mean pause durations at best only approaches significance (see Table [24  One account emphasizes the processes involved in choosing and communicating the state of global focus The other emphasizes the mutually recognized (by speaker and hearers) attentional and intentional state of the discourse It is because of their interdependence and synchrony that I can postulate the hypothesis that co-occurring linguistic and attentional phenomena in spoken discourse cue phrases, pauses and discourse structure and processing are linked Within this time, we might observe silence, a cue phrase or both The minimal cue in this regard is the filled pause Cue phrases serve not only the listener but also the speaker In other words, remaining in the current context or entering a subordinate context is expected behavior, while exiting the current context is not These are the focus space and the focus space stack In addition, these operations can be confused because both begin identically, with a series of pops The speculations presented in this section provide a theoretical framework If borne out, they can be re-fashioned as characterizations of the circumstances in which cue phrases and unfilled pauses are most likely to be used The relationships among cue phrases, unfilled pauses and the structuring of discourse are investigated within the paradigm of the tripartite model of discourse The focus space is the computational representation of processing in the current context, that is, for the discourse segment currently under construction Especially, the difficulty of utterance production might be explained by the complexity of the co-occurring focusing operation In addition, the aptness of the tripartite model itself is not assured The idealizations it contains may undergo modification in light of new results, or be augmented by other accounts of discourse processing Within a focus space dwell representations of the entities evoked during the construction of the segment propositions, relations, objects in the world and the DSP of the current discourse segment A focus space lives on a pushdown stack called the focus space stack The progression of focus in a discourse is modeled via the basic stack operations pushes and pops applied to the stack elements For example, closure of a discourse segment is modeled by popping its associated focus space from the stack; introduction of a segment is modeled by pushing its associated focus space onto the stack; retention of the current discourse segment is modeled by leaving its focus space on the stack in order to add or modify its elements Thus, at the end of a discourse the focus space stack is empty while the intentional structure is fully constructed The focus space model abstracts the processing that all participants must do in order to accurately track and affect the flow of discourse Thus, it treats the emerging discourse structure and the changing attentional foci as publicly accessible properties of the discourse In explaining certain lexical and prosodic features of discourse, it is often useful to return to these private models Lexical and prosodic focusing cues hasten synchronization For my analysis, the most relevant private model belongs to the current speaker, whose discourse intentions guide, for the moment, the flow of topic and attention in a discourse and whose spoken contributions provide the richest evidence of attentional state If cue phrases and unfilled pause durations can be shown to correlate with attentional state (and by definition, the intentional and linguistic structure the attentional state they reveal belongs to the current speaker, and the attentional changes they denote are the ones the speaker makes in her own private model The theory of the tripartite nature of discourse frames my hypotheses about the correlation of cue phrases, pause duration and discourse structure The main hypotheses are these: that particular unfilled pause durations tend to correlate with particular cue phrases and that this correlation is occasioned by changes to the attentional state of the discourse participants, or, equivalently, by the emerging intentional structure of a discourse Changes to the attentional state occur at segment boundaries The correlation of unfilled pauses with attentional state is less certain because pauses appear at all levels of discourse structure They are found within and between the smallest grammatical phrase, the sentence, the utterance, the speaking turn and the discourse segment To link this correlation with the task of producing discourse structure, we must posit a variety of attentional operations with corresponding variability in cognitive difficulty In particular, the theory motivates the selection of the cue phrase GROSZ-SIDNER a word or phrase whose relevance is to structural or rhetorical relations, rather than topic and the unfilled pause (silent pause) as significant indicators of discourse structure To link unfilled pause duration to discourse structure we must first establish that operations on the attentional state can be distinguished sufficiently to explain the different demands that each operation makes on discourse processing and which, therefore, might be reflected in the duration of segment-initial unfilled pauses The linking of pause duration to the processing of discourse segments motivates some auxiliary hypotheses that refine notions about the kinds of mental operations sanctioned by the focus space model and about the internal structure of a discourse segment In the theory of discourse structure, changes to the attentional state are modeled as operations on the focus space stack These operations appear reducible to four distinct sequences of stack operations that correspond to four distinct effects on the attentional state, as follows: One push Initiate a new focus space No push, no pop Retain the current focus space To explain the organization of a discourse into topics and subtopics, Grosz and Sidner postulate three interrelated components of discourse a linguistic structure, an intentional structure and an attentional state GROSZ-SIDNER  One or more pops Return to a previously initiated focus space One or more pops followed by a push Replace a previous focus space(s) with a new one To further motivate the particular usefulness of cue phrases and unfilled pauses as locators of discourse segment boundaries and markers of attentional state, it is useful to distinguish among three phases in the life of a discourse segment (and its focus space counterpart) its initiation, development and closure  In the linguistic structure, the linear sequence of utterances becomes hierarchical utterances aggregate into discourse segments, and the discourse segments are organized hierarchically according to the relations among the purposes or discourse intentions that each satisfies Boundary phenomena are of special relevance toward retrieving discourse structure from a multiplicity of lexical and acoustic clues An investigation of how cue phrases and unfilled pauses reflect discourse structure and the state of its processing is thus an investigation of the explicit and segment-initial evidence of focus space initiation Rather, these selections are motivated by features of the focus space model that both cue phrases and unfilled pauses might specially illuminate, and conversely, by features of the model that might specially illuminate the discourse function of cue phrases and unfilled pauses The relations among discourse intentions are captured in the intentional structure The study of cue phrases and their correlation with discourse structure and focus of attention is most extensive for the discourse marker SCHIFFRIN subcategory Discourse markers are generally single word phrases, such as Well, Now, Then or So, whose pragmatic role in a discourse usually follows from their syntactic and semantic role in a grammatical phrase For example SCHIFFRIN And, as a discourse marker, indicates connectedness, conveying the speaker's view that the utterance it heads is connected to the prior discourse.
