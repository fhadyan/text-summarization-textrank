 There are quite a few of these constructions, such as light verbs with noun phrase complements, light verbs with adjectival complements, and light nouns with post-modifiers (Dras and Dale, 1995 but this paper only looks at one construction, the light verbs with NP complements In particular, it examines the relationship of the relative frequency of a verb in these light verb constructions to its lightness So, to determine the support verb for proposal they look only at verbs which co-occur with the noun proposal I have termed this knowledge GLOBAL INFORMATION Counting all occurrences of each verb, regardless of their objects, yields a global relative frequency for that verb In this experiment the local information is combined with the global information to produce a modified likelihood of being a support verb To construct the global information, a comprehensive list of deverbal nominalisations is needed, together with the associated support verbs, determined from the local information Candidates for support verb were ranked in order of the product of local and global relative frequency of each candidate verb Notwithstanding these considerations, using the relative frequency of a verb in light constructions seems to be a fairly good indicator of a verb's content-freeness, providing plausible choices for support verbs for nominalisations Further work will involve extending this definition to other light constructions light verbs with adjectival complements, and light nouns with post-modifiers and fitting closed-class words, which traditionally comprise the class of non-content words, into the framework.
