 There are different types of text Texts about the same thing may be in differing genres, of different types, and of varying quality Discriminant analysis takes a set of precategorized individuals and data on their variation on a number of parameters, and works out a set discriminant functions which distinguishes between the groups For data we used the Brown corpus of English text samples of uniform length, categorized in several categories as seen in table  We ran discriminant analysis on the texts in the corpus using several different features as seen in table  Texts vary along several parameters, all relevant for the general information retrieval problem of matching reader needs and texts To categorize a set into N categories N-1 functions need to be determined Miscellaneous the most problematic category, is a loose grouping of different informative texts The single most problematic subsubset of texts is a subset of eighteen non-fiction texts labeled learned/humanities  Using the fourteen functions extracted, 258 cases were correctly classified and 242 cases misclassified out of the 500 cases, as shown in table  Given this variation, in a text retrieval context the problems are (i) identifying genres, and (ii) choosing criteria to cluster texts of the same genre, with predictable precision and recall We discuss how well this method categorizes a set text, given a set of categories, and given a set of parameters The statistical technique of factor analysis can be used to discover categories, like Biber has done Certain parameters probably vary more in certain text types than others, and they may have a skewed distribution as well As long as readability indexing schemes are used in descriptive applications they work well to discriminate between text types The technique shows practical promise The territorial maps shown in figures , , and are intuitively useful tools for displaying what type a particular text is, compared with other existing texts General text types may be useful, but quite probably genre will be a domain- or field-specific text typology The project at present studies texts which appear on several different types of USENET News conferences, and investigates how well the classification criteria and categories that experienced USENET News users report using (IntFilter, 1993) can be used by a newsreader system The project uses categories such as query comment announcement FAQ and so forth, categorizing them using parameters such as different types of length measures, form word content, quote level, percentage quoted text and other USENET News specific parameters Texts about certain topics may only occur in certain genres, and texts in certain genres may only treat certain topics; most topics do, however, occur in several genres, which is what interests us here Douglas Biber has studied text variation along several parameters, and found that texts can be considered to vary along five dimensions.
