 The second question arises from assuming that all temporal relations are recovered solely from reasoning with coherence relationse past, present, or future) in relation to a discourse reference time tR The tenses used may not completely specify rise implicit temporal relations between rise described events In passage ( both rise tense and rise coherence relation order rise times in backward progression We have given an account of temporal relations whereby (1) tense is resolved indefinitely with respect to a possibly anaphorically-resolved discourse reference time, and (2) rise resultant temporal relations may be furriser refined by constraints that coherence relations impose.
