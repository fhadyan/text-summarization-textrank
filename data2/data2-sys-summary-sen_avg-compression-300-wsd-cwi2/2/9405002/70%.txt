 Max spill because he spilt a bucket of water We address two related questions; the first arises from treating the simple past as anaphoric That is, one would predict a clash of temporal relations for sentence ( since the simple pasts induce the forward progression of time but the conjunction indicates the reverse temporal ordering The second question arises from assuming that all temporal relations are recovered solely from reasoning with coherence relations Specifically, to account for the forward progression of time induced by successive simple past tenses in a narrative, they treat the simple past as referring to a time evoked by a previous past tense We postulate rules characterizing the referential nature of tense and the role of discourse relations in further constraining the temporal relations between clausese past, present, or future) in relation to a discourse reference time tR For instance, a main verb past tense introduces a new temporal entity t under the constraint prior-to(t,tR  For simple tenses tR is the speech time, and therefore simple tenses are not anaphoric The tenses used may not completely specify the implicit temporal relations between the described events We describe three coherence relations relevant to the examples in this paper and give temporal constraints for them This relation does not impose constraints on the temporal relations between the events beyond those provided by the tenses themselves The temporal relations specified may be further refined as a by-product of establishing the coherence relationship extant between clauses, Narration being but one such relation Max spill In passage ( the auxiliary had refers to the event time of the slipping, and thus the past tense on spill creates a temporal entity constrained to precede that time This necessitates a coherence relation that is consistent with this temporal order, in this case, Explanation In passage ( the times evoked by the simple pasts are further ordered by the Explanation relation indicated by because, resulting in the backward progression of time In passage ( both the tense and the coherence relation order the times in backward progression Restating the first problem noted in Section 1, if treating the simple past as anaphoric is used to account for the forward progression of time in passage ( then one would expect the existence of the Explanation relation in passage ( ) to cause a temporal clash, where in fact passage ( ) is perfectly felicitous The Narration relation orders the times in forward progression in passage ( ) and the Explanation relation orders them in backward progression in passage (  Restating the second problem noted in Section 1, if temporal relations can be recovered solely from reasoning with coherence relations, and the use of the simple past in passage ( ) is as felicitous as the past perfect in passage ( ) under the Explanation interpretation, then one asks why passage ( ) is not understood as an Explanation as is passage ( where in each case the relationship needs to be inferred 470] Example ( ) indeed shows that coherence relations need to be utilized to account for temporal relations, but it does not bear on the issue of whether the past perfect is anaphoric This constraint is imposed only to require that the second clause contain the past perfect instead of the simple past On the other hand, sentences in the simple past are perfectly felicitous in standing alone or opening a discourse, introducing an asymmetry in accounts treating the simple past as anaphoric to a previously evoked time We have given an account of temporal relations whereby (1) tense is resolved indefinitely with respect to a possibly anaphorically-resolved discourse reference time, and (2) the resultant temporal relations may be further refined by constraints that coherence relations impose Max spill.
