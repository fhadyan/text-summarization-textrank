 Rules were then automatically learned that updated these chunk structure tags based on neighboring words and their part-of-speech and chunk tags The cross product of the 20 word and part-of-speech patterns with the 5 chunk tag patterns determined the full set of 100 templates used In the first of the baseNP lump, adjectives (with part-of-speech tag JJ) that are currently tagged I but that are followed by words tagged O have their tags changed to O (Since the tag B is only used when baseNPs abut, the baseline system tags determiners as I Rule 3 takes words which immediately follow determiners tagged I that in turn follow something tagged O and changes their tag to also be I Rules 4-6 are similar to Rule 2, marking the initial words of baseNPs that directly follow another baseNP To gloss a few of these, in the first rule here, determiners (with part-of-speech tag DT which usually begin N chunks and thus are assigned the baseline tag BN, have their chunk tags changed to N if they follow a word whose tag is also BN The fact that this system includes lexical rule templates that refer to actual words sets it apart from approaches that rely only on part-of-speech tags to predict chunk structure The most frequent single confusion involved words tagged VBG and VBN, whose baseline prediction given their part-of-speech tag was O, but which also occur frequently inside baseNPs The Treebank tags the words and and frequently with the part-of-speech tag CC, which the baseline system again predicted would fall most often outside of a baseNP For example, instead of referring to the word two to the left, a rule pattern could refer to the first word in the current chunk, or the last word of the previous chunk8% (NPs) for the finite-state methods These two kinds of chunk structure derived from the Treebank data were encoded as chunk tags attached to each word and provided the targets for the transformation-based learning In this work, we have found it convenient to do so by encoding the chunking using an additional set of tags, so that each word carries both a part-of-speech tag and also a chunk tag from which the chunk structure can be derived Punctuation marks, which are ignored in Abney's chunk grammar, but which the Treebank data treats as normal lexical items with their own part-of-speech tags, are unambiguously assigned the chunk tag P Transformational learning begins with some initial baseline prediction, which here means a baseline assignment of chunk tags to words Reasonable suggestions for baseline heuristics after a text has been tagged for part-of-speech might include assigning to each word the chunk tag that it carried most frequently in the training set, or assigning each part-of-speech tag the chunk tag that was most frequently associated with that part-of-speech tag in the training The source texts were then run through Brill's part-of-speech tagger , and, as a baseline heuristic, chunk structure tags were assigned to each word based on its part-of-speech tag In the text chunking application, the tags being assigned are chunk structure tags, while the part-of-speech tags are a fixed part of the environment, like the lexical identities of the words themselves.
