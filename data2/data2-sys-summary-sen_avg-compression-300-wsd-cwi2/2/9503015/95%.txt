 Here we will work upto the rules gradually, by considering which kinds of rules we might need in particular instances Now consider individual transitions This is relatively trivial using a non-curried notation similar to that used for AACG Now consider the first transition As an example, reconsider the string John likes Sue an np s State-Application can apply, as in Figure 2 as np or np  The second of these is perhaps the most interesting, and is given in Figure 3 (R( x The third allows ttransition to be a verb phrase modifier Mary thinks John coming transition was a mistake 1983  The second role can be captured by the parser constructing semantic representations directly This will be discussed in the final section of the paper Functional types included a list of arguments to the left, and a list of arguments to the right The only real difference is that Bar-Hillel allowed arguments to themselves be functions a relative clause 1990  1985) and HPSG, wtransition wh-arguments are treated using slash mechanisms or feature inheritance principles which correspond closely to function composition If X is a syntactic type, and L and R are lists of categories, then is a category Ttransition are two unusual features.
