 The phrase structure rule that describes this construction is Though a head-driven generator must generate first order head of order rule, nothing prescribes order order of generation of order complements of order head The relative efficiency of this evaluation leads our compiler to as order optimal evaluation order of our phrase structure rule for argument composition The optimal evaluation order for a phrase structure rule need not necessarily be head-first.
