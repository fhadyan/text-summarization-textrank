 This paper concerns how to generate and understand discourse anaphoric noun phrases, or noun phrases (NPs) that evoke a discourse entity already in the discourse model (Webber webber78  Dale dale89 dale92 implements Gricean constraints on informativeness for generating discourse anaphoric NPs Results in include a one-way correlation of overly informative discourse anaphoric NPs with shifts in global discourse structure The data reported above indicates that in the Pear corpus, definite pronouns and phrasal NPs are rarely over-specified or over-determined In the next section, I discuss how centering can be integrated with discuss model to account for under-specified pronouns, and certain over-specified phrasal NPs Then I modify discuss model to apply to understanding as well as generation; to include the current utterance in the context of evaluation; to apply informational constraints uniformly to pronouns and phrasal NPs; and to select modifiers on the basis of focused attribute-value pairs Dale dale89 generates anaphoric pronouns and phrasal NPs by distinct means Dale dale89 requires phrasal NPs to be distinguishing descriptions In discuss section, I present the results of an analysis of all discourse anaphoric NPs in a corpus of spoken narratives directed at the question of how informative NPs are, relative to their contexts of occurrence As in Webber webber78, Dale assumes that the discourse model represents the discourse entities that have already been evoked, and the attribute-value pairs describing them5% rate of over-specified discourse anaphoric NPs in the Pear data also supports the relaxation of brevity, but is partly conditioned by attentional factors (cf In discuss section I illustrate the role of in processing definite pronouns and phrasal NPs C_describe is a 4-place relation among a discourse entity E, a surface NP, the current utterance context , and the discourse context C that requires to be a distinguishing description of E relative to C The next subsection presents results showing that discourse anaphoric NPs in the corpus, whether pronominal or phrasal, are rarely more informative than necessary, and if so, tend to occur at shifts in global discourse structure A definite pronoun that is a distinguishing description is also a minimal distinguishing description because its length is 1 In generation, C attempts first to find a definite pronoun to satisfy the uninstantiated NP argument, succeeding if the pronoun is a distinguishing description , the arguments of are: The utterance context is assumed to be a feature structure co-indexed with any relevant discourse entities other than the uninstantiated variable E By using the utterance as part of the input in solving for NP, given information that appears anywhere in the current utterance can filter entities from the discourse context, following Dale's dale89 algorithm Dale dale89 takes the universe of discourse to be partitioned into focus spaces (cf I assume that segment boundaries in the Pear corpus correspond to focus spaces, and that some focus spaces may be composed of others Given such a mechanism, a new focus space would be added to the discourse model after a segment onset has been processed An analogous process applies to understanding the same pronoun in U4, with the entity variable E uninstantiated, NP instantiated to he and the utterance and discourse context instantiated as above Partitioning the search space into focus spaces controls the search through the discourse model to some degree In Fig The resulting NP the man is a minimal distinguishing description because no pronoun is a distinguishing description Above, I noted that centering can add structure to the search space for understanding discourse anaphoric NPs , the subject NP the boy is not a pronoun even though the utterance context is a distinguishing description of e2 The phrasal NPs in (2b) are adequate but not efficient (over-specified  Thus a definite pronoun is presumably well-specified, and the model presented so far would generate he  However, a pronoun would produce a garden path effect in discuss context; i First, constrains the semantic content of a discourse anaphoric NP, but not its grammatical role However, his model follows the tradition of assuming that distinct constraints govern pronouns versus phrasal NPs (cf Centering is a model of local focus of attention that constrains the use of definite pronouns  One of the discourse entities evoked by an NP in an utterance Ui may be the backward-looking center (CB) of Ui, the current local focus of attention But in discuss context, neither the pronoun alone nor the utterance is a distinguishing description of anyone, so the pronoun is under-specified On the other hand, integrating centering and can account for both NPs in U108and support inferences consistent with a global focus shift In Fig Centering and Gricean constraints coincide here in that the definite pronoun they is also a minimal distinguishing description , the feature increasing distinguishes between over-determined and over-specified NPs In understanding the object NP, the context argument must be instantiated to a more inclusive focus space, since neither the previous utterance nor the previous segment contains any entities described by discuss NP U10 would have a null CB because there is no definite pronoun constrained by property sharing that corefers with an NP in the previous utterance; in fact no NPs in U10 refer to entities mentioned in U9 A definite pronoun subject in U10 would be assumed to be CBU10 and would be inferred to refer to e1 Consequently, a pronoun must be blocked This imposes output constraints requiring the subject and object NPs to be other than definite pronouns I have presented an analysis of discourse anaphoric phrasal NPs in a corpus of narrative monologues showing that pronouns and phrasal NPs are rarely over-specified Centering predicts conditions under which an under-specified pronoun can be used, but says little about the interpretation of phrasal NPs In contrast to Dale Reiter dalereiter94, distinguishing descriptions are evaluated using the current utterance context as a filter, and by instantiating the discourse context successively to the Cf list of the preceding utterance, then the current focus space, then other focus spaces, until a solution is found Another mechanism would be needed to relax informational constraints at shifts in focus structure, so as to account for the one-way implication of over-specified NPs with global shifts of attention (Table  When neither the Cf list nor the current focus space is the appropriate context for understanding or generating a discourse anaphoric NP, I have assumed that either an earlier focus space or a more inclusive one must be accessed For example, the segment onset in Fig (U108) contains two NPs, one of which is the same as the CB of the preceding utterance Maintaining the same CB relates U108 and its focus space (FS22) to the most recent focus space FS21 But the object NP expresses attributes last mentioned in segment 17, thus relating U108 to the earlier focus space FS17 As part of a long term study of the relationship between linguistic features and discourse structure discourse anaphoric NPs in the corpus had already been coded for coreference relations and location Location of an NP is represented here in terms of the containing sentential utterance and discourse segment, as described below Centering gjw83 kameyama85, a model of local attentional state sidner79, has been applied primarily to definite pronouns I argue that Gricean constraints should be applied equally to discourse anaphoric pronouns and phrasal NPs, and that integrating centering and informational constraints covers a broader range of cases In , I present an analysis of all discourse anaphoric NPs (N=1,233) in a corpus of ten narratives showing that semantic explicitness depends largely on informational constraints In Fig , the sequence of coreferential NPs used to refer to the little boy are coindexed Discourse anaphoric NPs almost never provide new information, and are rarely more informative than necessary At the onset of segment 7, a phrasal NP is used to refer to him (U30) whereas at the onset of segment 8 (U33 a definite pronoun is used The pronoun subject in U33is locally well-specified because the boy is the only animate entity mentioned in U32; it is globally well-specified because the boy is the only entity in the discourse with a bicycle The goal of the analysis is to determine whether relative informativeness of NPs correlates with global discourse structure (cf Any phrasal NP that is discourse anaphoric is potentially over-specified, whereas a definite pronoun will only be over-specified if a zero pronoun could have been used I first sorted the discourse anaphoric NPs in the corpus (N=1,233) into the three categories of phrasal NPs (PhrNPs; N=563 explicit pronouns (PROs: definite, indefinite, demonstrative; N=544 and zero pronominals (ZPs; N=126  In , I show how Dale Reiter's dalereiter94 generation model can be augmented to apply uniformly to pronouns and phrasal NPs for both generation and understanding This procedure identified 128 discourse anaphoric NPs in the corpus that were potentially over-specified or over-determined Potentially over-specified NPs were sorted into four mutually exclusive categories well-specified, segment onset, attentional shift, and reiterative A potentially over-specified NP that is not well-specified, but which occurs in the first utterance of a new segment, is classified as a segment onset While centering has been used to account for informationally under-specified pronouns, I argue that centering also accounts for certain over-specified phrasal NPsg repetitions, repairs, contrastive NPs and unexplained cases Of the 69 NPs whose nearest antecedent was in a distinct segment, 29% occurred at a segment onset In sum, in the coded Pear corpus, NPs that re-evoke existing entities seem to be rarely over-specified (68/1233, or 5 To account for the choice of modifiers in phrasal discourse anaphoric NPs, it is necessary to determine how attributes are selected from the information known about a discourse entity With respect to discourse anaphoric NPs in the Pear stories, NP modifiers are derived from what I refer to as focussed attribute sets, independent of whether the NP is over-specified.
