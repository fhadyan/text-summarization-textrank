 We start out from the set of infinite constructor trees with holes (free variables  The algorithm decides satisfiability of constraints containing equations and , and constraints over infinite constructor trees with free variables The types of the variables involved are described by the following constraint Constraint variables must contain at least base variables Constraints are atomic constraints closed under conjunction The trees of are called ground trees Let us consider constructor trees as special feature trees with integer-valued features, a distinguished feature label (e Intersection variables are defined as nonempty finite subsets of base variables Type checking polymorphic recursion is equivalent to semi-unification and to subsumption of feature graphs.
