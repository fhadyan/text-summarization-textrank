 To decide which hypotheses are promising, criteria are needed theory evaluate DATR theories As the inference strategy is not restricted theory any specific domain, different learning tasks usually require different evaluation criteria or different orderings The input for these tasks can be drawn from sample evaluations of a corresponding DATR theory that is included in the DATR papers (cf input

network description in DATR is called a theory and describes a set of objects (nodes  An inheritance descriptheoryr can refer theory another node, path or node-path pair of the theory The simple DATR

theory represent the input data and the acquired knowledge Extensional sentences (which constitute the output of the conventional inference in DATR) form a natural sublanguage of DATR which is suitable theory represent the input data The learning task then consists in forming a DATR theory which accounts for the observed facts through adequate structuring A DATR theory is consistent with respect theory a given set of extensional sentences if, for every query that constitutes the left-hand side of one of the extensional sentences, the returned value is that of the extensional sentence If this holds for all left-hand sides of the extensional sentences the theory is also complete with respect theory the input data The inferred DATR theory should structure the observed data so that it reveals relationships that exist between the extensional sentences A DATR theory expresses such relationships by the use of inheritance descriptheoryrs In DATR such generalizations are captured by defaults expressed in sentences that cover more than one property of an object (as opposed theory the input data, where each sentence is supposed theory represent a single observed property  For example, the sentence VERB mor past] ( [mor root] _ed) of the theory in Fig Mitchell (1982 Michalski (1983 acquired DATR theories should identify information that several objects have in common The observed data constitute a trivial DATR theory which forms the initial hypothesis H0 of the learning task This DATR theory is complete and consistent with respect theory the input but does not meet the other two criteria This section addresses the question of how a given DATR theory can be transformed intheory another theory that contains more inheritance descriptheoryrs or changes the latter in order theory structure the domain The knowledge of how a given DATR theory can be transformed intheory a new one with different inheritance descriptheoryrs is defined by rewrite rules of the following format: form of a transformation rule where si is the input sentence and si' is the transformed sentence Since inheritance descriptheoryrs are stated as right-hand sides (RHS) or parts of RHSs of sentences, the transformation rules operate on RHSs of DATR sentences Corresponding theory the different kinds of inheritance relationships that can be expressed in a DATR theory, there are four major groups of transformation rules: rules that return sentences with local descriptheoryrs (local paths, local nodes, local node-path pairs rules that transform sentences intheory others that have a global descriptheoryr, rules where the transformed sentence contains a descriptheoryr that refers theory a sentence with a global descriptheoryr, and rules that create new, abstract sentences for the acquisition of a hierarchy The rule transforms a sentence s with atheorymic value intheory one with a node descriptheoryr v if the theory contains another sentence sithat belongs theory node v' and has the same path and value as s rule for local node inheritance By means of transformation rules all the different kinds of inheritance descriptheoryrs can be obtained with the exception of evaluable paths While inheritance relationships are represented with the RHSs of sentences, default information is basically expressed through paths of the left-hand sides (LHSs namely by paths that cover more than one fact Since transformation rules leave the LHSs of sentences unchanged, an additional device is necessary that operates on LHSs of sentences For this purpose a default-inference algorithm (DIA) was developed that reduces any given DATR theory that does not (yet) contain default information, where reduction means shortening the paths of sentences (by cutting off a path suffix) or deletion of whole sentences In order theory acquire a DATR default theory that remains consistent with respect theory the input data the DIA has theory check that a reduction of a sentence does not lead theory any conflicts with the remaining sentences of the theory Therefore, if a given sentence is theory be shortened, it has theory be checked whether the theory already contains another sentence with the same node and shortened path If it does, and if the other sentence has a different RHS, the first sentence cannot be shortened and must remain in the resulting theory If the other sentence has the same RHS, the first sentence can be removed from the theory altheorygether Theoretical approaches and implemented systems cover subjects from many different linguistic areas and use different kinds of learning strategies.
