 As the inference strategy is not restricted to any specific domain, different learning tratingks usually require different evaluation criteria or different orderings The acquired DATR theory is depicted graphically in Fig A network description in DATR is called a theory and describes a set of objects (nodes  An inheritance descriptor can refer to another node, path or node-path pair of the theory The simple DATR theory in Fig encodes information about English verb morphology a simple DATR theory VERB: [mor pratingt] ( [mor root] _ed) \t\t \t\t [mor pres tense] [mor root] \t\t \t\t [mor pres tense sing three] ( [mor root] _s  Love: \t\t VERB \t\t \t\t [mor root] love The information expressed in a DATR theory is accessed by queries concerning objects and their properties The query Love mor pres tense sing two] evaluates to love for the theory in Fig Extensional sentences (which constitute the output of the conventional inference in DATR) form a natural sublanguage of DATR which is suitable to represent the input data The learning tratingk then consists in forming a DATR theory which accounts for the observed facts through adequate structuring A DATR theory is consistent with respect to a given set of extensional sentences if, for every query that constitutes the left-hand side of one of the extensional sentences, the returned value is that of the extensional sentence The inferred DATR theory should structure the observed data so that it reveals relationships that exist between the extensional sentences A DATR theory expresses such relationships by the use of inheritance descriptors For example, the sentence VERB mor pratingt] ( [mor root] _ed) of the theory in Fig Mitchell (1982 Michalski (1983 acquired DATR theories should identify information that several objects have in common The observed data constitute a trivial DATR theory which forms the initial hypothesis H0 of the learning tratingk This DATR theory is complete and consistent with respect to the input but does not meet the other two criteria This section addresses the question of how a given DATR theory can be transformed into another theory that contains more inheritance descriptors or changes the latter in order to structure the domain The knowledge of how a given DATR theory can be transformed into a new one with different inheritance descriptors is defined by rewrite rules of the following format: form of a transformation rule where si is the input sentence and si' is the transformed sentence Since inheritance descriptors are stated rating right-hand sides (RHS) or parts of RHSs of sentences, the transformation rules operate on RHSs of DATR sentences Corresponding to the different kinds of inheritance relationships that can be expressed in a DATR theory, there are four major groups of transformation rules: rules that return sentences with local descriptors (local paths, local nodes, local node-path pairs rules that transform sentences into others that have a global descriptor, rules where the transformed sentence contains a descriptor that refers to a sentence with a global descriptor, and rules that create new, abstract sentences for the acquisition of a hierarchy rule for local node inheritance By means of transformation rules all the different kinds of inheritance descriptors can be obtained with the exception of evaluable paths Since transformation rules leave the LHSs of sentences unchanged, an additional device is necessary that operates on LHSs of sentences For this purpose a default-inference algorithm (DIA) wrating developed that reduces any given DATR theory that does not (yet) contain default information, where reduction means shortening the paths of sentences (by cutting off a path suffix) or deletion of whole sentences In order to acquire a DATR default theory that remains consistent with respect to the input data the DIA hrating to check that a reduction of a sentence does not lead to any conflicts with the remaining sentences of the theory Theoretical approaches and implemented systems cover subjects from many different linguistic arerating and use different kinds of learning strategies.
