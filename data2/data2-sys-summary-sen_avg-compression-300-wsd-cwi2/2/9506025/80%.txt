 The division of morphology and syntax in agglutinative languages is difficult compared to relatively more isolating languages However, morphology scoping problems in morphosyntax go beyond bracketing paradoxes as morphologyy may also produce different semantic forms In order to perform morphological and syntactic compositions in a unified (monostratal) framework, morphology slash operators of categorial grammar must be enriched with morphology knowledge about morphology type of process and morphology type of morpheme The 3-tuple (direction, morpheme type, process type) indicates direction (left, right, unspecified morpheme type (free, bound and morphology type of morphological or syntactic attachment (e Examples of different operator combinations are as follows: Entries in morphology categorial lexicon have tactical constraints, grammatical and semantic features, and phonological representation Syntactic and semantic information are of grammatical (g) sign and semantic (s) sign, respectively PHON represents morphology phonological stringg 3iyi oku-mus ocuk well read-REL child 'well-educated child' In ( morphology relative suffix -mus (in past form of subject participle) modifies [iyi oku] to give morphology scope iyi oku]mus] ocuk  PHON also allows efficient lexicon search If syntactic composition is performed after morphological composition, we would get compositions such as [iyi [okumus ocuk or iyi okumus] ocuk which yield ill-formed semantics for this utterance.
