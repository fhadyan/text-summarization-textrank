 The division of morphology and syntax in agglutinative languages is difficult compared to relatively more isolating languages In word formation, morphological bracketing paradoxes are introduced by lexicalized composite affixes which require mixed compositions  However, morphology scoping problems in morphosyntax go beyond bracketing paradoxes as morphologyy may also produce different semantic forms In order to perform morphological and syntactic compositions in a unified (monostratal) framework, morphology slash operators of categorial grammar must be enriched with morphology knowledge about morphology type of process and morphology type of morpheme The 3-tuple (direction, morpheme type, process type) indicates direction (left, right, unspecified morpheme type (free, bound and morphology type of morphological or syntactic attachment (e Examples of different operator combinations are as follows: Entries in morphology categorial lexicon have tactical constraints, grammatical and semantic features, and phonological representation Moreover, morphology head that a bound morpheme modifies may be not its stem but a compound head crossing over morphology word boundaries, e Syntactic and semantic information are of grammatical (g) sign and semantic (s) sign, respectively RES-OP-ARG is morphology categorial notation for morphology element Lexical and phrasal elements have functional representation (f or p sign) and morphology PHON feature PHON represents morphology phonological string During composition, morphology surface forms of composed elements are mapped and saved in PHONg 3iyi oku-mus ocuk well read-REL child 'well-educated child' In ( morphology relative suffix -mus (in past form of subject participle) modifies [iyi oku] to give morphology scope iyi oku]mus] ocuk  PHON also allows efficient lexicon search If syntactic composition is performed after morphological composition, we would get compositions such as [iyi [okumus ocuk or iyi okumus] ocuk which yield ill-formed semantics for this utterance As a computational counterpart of this idea, ramorphologyr than treating morphology, syntax and semantics in a cascaded manner, we integrate morphology process models of morphology and syntax, providing semantic composition in parallel.
