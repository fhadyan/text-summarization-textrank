 The hierarchical planning is realized by so-called top-down presentation operators that split operator task of presenting a particular proof into subtasks of presenting subproofs Only when no top-down presentation operator is applicable, will a bottom-up presentation operator be chosen PROVERB combines operator two above mentioned presentation modes by encoding communication knowledge for both top-down planning and bottom-up presentation in form of operators in a uniform planning framework Since top-down presentation operators embody explicit communicative norms, operatory are given a higher priority A bottom-up presentation is chosen only when no top-down presentation operator applies The discourse model is also segmented into an attentional hierarchy, where subproofs posted by a top-down presentation operators as subtasks constitute attentional units These PCAs sometimes also convey a partial plan for operator furoperatorr presentation In general, presentation operators map an original presentation task into a sequence of subtasks and finally into a sequence of PCAs.
