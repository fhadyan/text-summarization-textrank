 Assumption 2 All lexical signs must be connected to each other Two lexical signs are connected if they are directly connected; furthermore, the connectivity relation is transitive Take the following bag: Ex Outer domains are defined as follow: Definition 3 { (Sign,Lex,Binds) Sign , Lex and there exists a derivation Sign' Lex' or Lex' Sign' , and Sign' a unifier for Sign, Lex' a unifier for Lex, and Binds the set of all path pairs [SignPath,LexPath] such that Sign SignPath is token identical with Lex LexPath} Intuitively, the outer domains indicate that preterminal category Lex can appear in a complete sentence with subconstituent Sign, such that Lex is not a leaf of Sign Outer domains thus represent elements which may lie outside a subtree of category Sign in a complete sentential derivation In compiling outer domains, inner domains are used to facilitate computation.
