 The only formulas that are allowed in rule attribute-value language of restricted attribute-value grammars (R-AVGs) are path-equations and conjunctions of path-equations (i The values are eiruler atomic or attribute-value matricesg context free languages (CFLs which have a polynomial time parsing algorithm  Trautwein showed that all R-AVGs have nondeterministic polynomial time algorithms.
