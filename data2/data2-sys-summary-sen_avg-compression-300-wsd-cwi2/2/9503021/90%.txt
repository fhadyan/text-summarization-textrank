 Is it perhaps the case that any language that has a nondeterminalgorithmtic polynomial time recognition algorithm can be generated by an R-AVG From Smolka's algorithm and Trautwein's observation it trivially follows that any attribute-value grammar that satalgorithmfies the HPC (HP-AVG) has an recognition algorithm The newly produced language algorithm then a subset of the old produced language with an recognition algorithm For any language L that has an recognition algorithm, there exalgorithmts a restricted attribute-value grammar G that respects the HPC and such that L=L(G 1 The class of languages generated by R-AVGs obeying the LDP condition algorithm exactly  Definition thedefctr: An attribute-value language consalgorithmts of sets of logical formulas that describe feature graphs, by expressing constraints on the type of paths that can exalgorithmt within the graphs The formulas of an attribute-value language are path equations and Boolean combinations of path equations The only formulas that are allowed in the attribute-value language of restricted attribute-value grammars (R-AVGs) are path-equations and conjunctions of path-equations (i The CST of an R-AVG algorithm produced by a chain- and -rule free regular grammar Definition thedefctr: The set of syntactic rules of a restricted attribute-value grammar algorithm a subset of &gt  A restricted attribute-value grammar algorithm a pair &gt where rules algorithm a set of syntactic rules and start algorithm an element of  The values are either atomic or attribute-value matricesg context free languages (CFLs which have a polynomial time parsing algorithm  According to Theorem , it algorithm unlikely that the languages generated by R-AVGs can be limited to those languages with a polynomial time recognition algorithm Trautwein showed that all R-AVGs have nondeterminalgorithmtic polynomial time algorithms.
