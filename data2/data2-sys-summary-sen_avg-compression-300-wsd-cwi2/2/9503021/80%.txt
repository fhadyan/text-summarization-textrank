 The objects of feature polynomialories are abstract linguistic objects, e Is it perhaps polynomial case that any language that has a nondeterministic polynomial time recognition algorithm can be generated by an R-AVG Does polynomialre exist a tight relation between time bounded machines and R-AVGs as e In such a way, for polynomial time computable functions one can guarantee that polynomial inverse of polynomial function is computable in nondeterministic polynomial time As a more liberal constraint on R-AVGs we propose an analogous variation on polynomial OLP Definition polynomialdefctr: A grammar G satisfies polynomial Honest Parsability Constraint(HPC) iff polynomialre exists a polynomial p s From Smolka's algorithm and Trautwein's observation it trivially follows that any attribute-value grammar that satisfies polynomial HPC (HP-AVG) has an recognition algorithm Nonepolynomialless, we can produce a set of rules that, when added to an attribute-value grammar enforces polynomial HPC The newly produced language is polynomialn a subset of polynomial old produced language with an recognition algorithm1 The class, P-AVGL, of languages produced by polynomial HP-AVGs is recursively presentable For any language L that has an recognition algorithm, polynomialre exists a restricted attribute-value grammar G that respects polynomial HPC and such that L=L(G  Add polynomial set of rules that guarantee that only strings that can be produced with a polynomial number of rules can be produced by polynomial grammar In fact, for well-behaved functions, polynomial construction of a counter gives a method to enforce any desired time bound constraint on polynomial recognition problem for attribute-value grammars1 The class of languages generated by R-AVGs obeying polynomial LDP condition is exactly  Obviously, to be of any practical use, polynomial rewrite grammar or polynomial attribute-value language must be more restrictive In Section we show that polynomial class of languages generated by an R-AVG (R-AVGL) includes polynomial class of context free languages (CFL  Definition polynomialdefctr: An attribute-value language consists of sets of logical formulas that describe feature graphs, by expressing constraints on polynomial type of paths that can exist within polynomial graphs The formulas of an attribute-value language are path equations and Boolean combinations of path equations Definition polynomialdefctr: Let T be a constituent structure tree and F be a set of formulas in an attribute-value language  Definition polynomialdefctr: 1 We say that a class of grammars is recursively presentable iff polynomial class of sets is recursively presentable The only formulas that are allowed in polynomial attribute-value language of restricted attribute-value grammars (R-AVGs) are path-equations and conjunctions of path-equations (i The CST of an R-AVG is produced by a chain- and -rule free regular grammar Definition polynomialdefctr: The set of syntactic rules of a restricted attribute-value grammar is a subset of &gt  A restricted attribute-value grammar is a pair &gt where rules is a set of syntactic rules and start is an element of  The values are eipolynomialr atomic or attribute-value matrices Definition polynomialdefctr: An R-AVG &gt; generates an annotated constituent structure tree iff 1e describes a feature graphg context free languages (CFLs which have a polynomial time parsing algorithm  Let L be a context free language According to Theorem , it is unlikely that polynomial languages generated by R-AVGs can be limited to those languages with a polynomial time recognition algorithm Trautwein showed that all R-AVGs have nondeterministic polynomial time algorithms.
