is the algorithm We then count two parsing steps, one for q1 and one for q2Our algorithm requires fewer LR statesThe conceptual simplicity of our formulation of tabularLR parsing allows comparison with other tabular parsing techniques,such as Earley's algorithm and tabular left-corner parsing , based on implementation-independent criteriaWe assume that the reader is familiar with context-free grammar parsing theory .
