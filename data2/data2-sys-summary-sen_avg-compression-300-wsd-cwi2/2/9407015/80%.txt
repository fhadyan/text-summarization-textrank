 Given the syntactic and focus-marked semantic representation for the response, along with the syntactic and focus-marked semantic representation for the theme of the response, a representation for the rheme of the response can be worked out from the CCG rules Although the responses in these two sentences possess the same intonational tunes, the pitch accent location is crucial for conveying the appropriate contrastive properties The difference between members of sets like L, LL% and LL$ boundaries embodies Pierrehumbert and Beckman's distinction between intermediate phrase boundaries, intonational phrase boundaries, and utterance boundaries and may themselves be function categories For example, subject NPs bear the following category in the full notation: traumaid The derivation of the same simple transitive sentence using type-raised categories is illustrated in example in the abbreviated notation [a You propose, and Traumaid recommends, lavage Steedman [  Then we lock these two structural systems together via the following principle, which says that syntactic and prosodic constituency must be isomorphic: PROSODIC CONSTITUENT CONDITION: Combination of two syntactic categories via a syntactic combinatory rule is only allowed if their prosodic categories can also combine via a prosodic combinatory rule One way to accomplish this is to give pitch accents the category of functions from boundaries to intonational/intermediate phrases For example, the boundary L maps an H* pitch accent into an intermediate phrase rheme, p:rheme The categories that result from the combination of a pitch accent and a boundary may or may not constitute entire prosodic phrases, since there may be prenuclear material bearing null tone There may also be material bearing null tone separating the pitch accent(s) from the boundary We therefore assign the following category to the null tone, which can thereby apply to the right to any non-functional category of the form X:Y, and compose to the right with any function into such a category, including another null tone, to yield the same category: It is this omnivorous category that allows intonational tunes to be spread over arbitrarily large constituents, since it allows the pitch accent's desire for a boundary to propagate via composition into the null tone category, as in the earlier papers These rules change the prosodic category either to utterance, or to an endocentric function over that category Example  Traumaid recommends lavage L+H* LH% H* LL$ S:s S:s NP traumaid (S:recommend'x y NP:y NP:x NP lavage' p:theme/b:lh p:theme p:theme/b:lh) u:rheme SYN B PHON S:recommend' x *traumaid NP:x p:theme PHON PHON S:recommend' x *traumaid NP:x NP lavage' utterance/utterance utterance SYN PHON S: recommend' *lavage' *traumaid' utterance [Theme S:recommend' z *traumaid NP:z [Rheme NP lavage Note that it is the identification of the theme and rheme at the stage before the final reduction that determines the information structure for the response, for it is at this point that discourse elements like the theme of the answer can be defined, and can be used in semantically-driven synthesis of intonation contour directly from the grammar Traumaid recommends LA VAGE H* LL$ Such an utterance is of course ambiguous as to whether the theme is traumaid or what traumaid recommends However, in any context where thoracotomy procedures are already established as the set of procedures in question, the pitch accent on thoracotomy in the response will be inappropriate and perhaps even misleading Here the question itself establishes a contextual set Q: Does Traumaid prefer a LEFT thoracotomy or a RIGHT thoracotomy? A: (Traumaid prefers) (a LEFT thoracotomy The mere fact that alternatives are contrasted on a syntactical property is not enough however to mandate the inclusion of a pitch accent on the corresponding linguistic material Thus, in a situation in which the choices include a left thoracotomy, a right thoracotomy, a left thoracostomy and a right thoracostomy, the response to question , in which the adjective is unstressed, is perfectly appropriate: Q: Does Traumaid prefer a LEFT thora COTomy or a RIGHT thora COSTomy? A: (Traumaid prefers) (a left thora COTomy This example suggests that the set that is being considered by the time the adjective is semantically evaluated is no longer the entire set including the left and right thoracotomy and thoracostomy procedures In fact, it is not even the set containing only the left thoracotomy and right thoracostomy procedures, but rather the set containing only the left thoracotomy procedure, which by definition does not stand in contrast to any other thoracotomy procedure by virtue of the property of being performed on the left side This set arises because the noun thoracotomy restricts over the set including the left thoracotomy and the right thoracostomy procedures Q: Does Traumaid prefer a LEFT thora COTomy, a RIGHT thora COTomy or a LEFT thora COSTomy? A: (Traumaid prefers) (a LEFT thora COTomy Here the set established by the question is restricted by the noun in the rheme of the answer to be a set of two thoracotomy procedures (both left and right  Since they are distinguished by the property left, the corresponding linguistic material must be accented The set of alternatives is restricted by properties or objects explicitly mentioned in the theme of the question But which condition is a left THORACOSTOMY recommended for? A: A left THORACOSTOMY is recommended for the simple PNEUmothorax nIn the current implementation, such lexical stress shift is handled by identifying the lexical contrast properties in the alternative set representations and supplying separate pronunciations in the lexicon.
