 Thus, the semantic what is -complexity of S is greater than the what is -complexity of T Similarly, we can compute the semantic complexity of ELIZA as Q-complexity And these numbers are closer to our intuitive understanding of the semantic complexity of the two sets yes/no and what-is complexities  What is -complexity: A natural language understanding system has to deal with a set of basic objects Namely, what is -complexity and twice-iterated-what-is -complexity measures the size of the database of background knowledge facts Intuitively, this is a reasonable measure of their semantic complexity Complexity of grammatical constructions: In many cases the complexity of a new construction is not much greater than the complexity of the subconstructions they are built from We have defined semantic complexity by connecting the concept of Kolmogorov complexity with the types of questions that can apply to a sentence (a string  Acknowledgments Kanevsky for our discussions of semantic complexity, and W Secondly, they have a similar number of background knowledge facts One of the tools for measuring complexity widely used in theoretical computer science is Kolmogorov complexity We could define semantic complexity of a set of sentences S as its Kolmogorov complexity, i Let Q be a set of questions We now want to examine a few measures of semantic complexity: yes/no-complexity, and what is -complexity We also analyze the complexity of ELIZA as Q-complexity, and argue that defining semantic complexity of NL interfaces as Q-complexity makes sense.
