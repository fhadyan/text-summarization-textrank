 Our techniques apply to the feature structures described by Carpenter  Phrase markers are those partial phrase markers which have no non-terminal leaves Consider the simple grammar in figure and its training against the corpus in figure  Each introduction relationship has a probability and the probabilities for all the introduction relationships that apply to a given non-maximal type must sum to one The hierarchy whose ALE syntax is given in figure is captured in the new notation by figure We associate probabilities with feature structures, which are sets of maximal and non-maximal nodes generated by beginning from the starting node and successively expanding non-maximal leaves of the partial tree Maximally specified feature structures are those feature structures which have only maximal leaves The probabilities tell us that the corpus contains no free-standing structures of type num The zero probability of codifies a similar observation that there are no free-standing structures with type phrase These sets of nodes are equivalence classes.
