 Our techniques apply to the feature structures described by Carpenter  As things stand the stochastic procedure is free to generate structures where , but , which are not in fact legal feature structures This leads to distortions of the probability estimates since the training algorithm spends part of its probability mass on impossible structures We review the standard probabilistic interpretation of PCFGs  We associate probabilities with partial phrase markers, which are sets of terminal and non-terminal nodes generated by beginning from the starting node successively expanding non-terminal leaves of the partial tree Phrase markers are those partial phrase markers which have no non-terminal leaves The definition of PCFGs implies that the probability of a phrase marker depends only on the choice of rules used in expanding non-terminal nodes Consider the simple grammar in figure and its training against the corpus in figure  Each introduction relationship has a probability and the probabilities for all the introduction relationships that apply to a given non-maximal type must sum to one In the probabilistic type hierarchy, it is the iterated introduction relationships which correspond to the context-free rewrite rules of a PCFG The hierarchy whose ALE syntax is given in figure is captured in the new notation by figure We associate probabilities with feature structures, which are sets of maximal and non-maximal nodes generated by beginning from the starting node and successively expanding non-maximal leaves of the partial tree Maximally specified feature structures are those feature structures which have only maximal leaves The probabilities tell us that the corpus contains no free-standing structures of type num The zero probability of codifies a similar observation that there are no free-standing structures with type phrase These sets of nodes are equivalence classes For the purposes of the expansion algorithm, a fully inequated feature structure consists of a feature tree (as before) and an equivalence relation over all the maximal nodes in that tree.
