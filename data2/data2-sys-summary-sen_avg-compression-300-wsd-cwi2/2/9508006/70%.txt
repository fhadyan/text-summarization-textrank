 Transfer based approaches to machine translation (MT) involve three main phases: analysis, approach and generation In its original formulation, LMT consists of three main phrases: analysis, lexical-semantic approach and generation Suffice it to say that in our implementation, an attempt has been made to share maximum information between input and output lexical signs, although values such as semantic variables are not shared between input and output lexical signs Such restrictions need to be incorporated in the monolingual lexical signs and rules Implementationally, bilexical rules may be applied off-line in order to expand the bilexicon before processing, or they may be applied during approach to extend the bilexicon just sufficiently to enable approach We now show how bi-lexical rules can be used in the translation of `thirsty basing our analysis on the classification of support verbs proposed by for English-French translation The analysis phase involves parsing the input sentence to produce an output bag or multiset of SL lexical signs instantiated with sufficient information to permit appropriate translation Information regarding which support verb a noun requires is encoded in its lexical entry We will consider neutral support verbs only although the other categories could also be handled through bi-lexical rules Transfer maps these signs into a TL bag through the bilingual lexicon in which sets of source and target lexical signs are placed in translation correspondence An English-Spanish bi-lexical rule is then introduced to derive the adjective on the English side and to include the neutral support verb `be on the Spanish side the support verb tener, for the noun sed, is introduced: has an unquenchable thirst' and similar examples The neutral (ntrl) control verb required by the English adjective is included in its lexical entry's Qualia structure During approach, the bi-lexical rule above is applied to the bi-lexical entry for `thirst' to yield: be1e,s,x, thirsty1x tener1e,s,x, sed1xThis multi-lexeme relation is used to translate `is thirsty' into tiene sed; a separate entry translates `John' into Juan The purpose of bi-lexical rules then is to minimize the repetition of information in the bi-lexicon while allowing the exploitation of monolingual lexical processes There are other translation phenomena which can be described through the use of bi-lexical rules In the bi-lexical rule view, one relates verb translations to translations incorporating lexicalization patterns as follows: translation which includes `across' as a modifier (we leave the restriction on verbs to movement events implicit; also, a simplified description of `across' is assumed (  This is a major obstacle for syntactic and even some semantic based translation systems because of the recursive nature of their approach representations To exemplify the use of bi-lexical rules in head switching, we consider translation in embedded contexts in more detail now This concludes our overview of the different translation mismatches that may be handled through bi-lexical rules One difficulty we have found with bilexical rules has been their composition For example, consider the following translation: 1) John marched the soldiers across the valley Ideally one should be able to use the output of one as input to the other to derive `march across - hacer cruzar marchando but this is not possible because both bi-lexical rules expect a mono-lexeme bilexical entry One possible solution is to manually add further bi-lexical rules which incorporate the bi-lexical rules The line of work we are investigating combines bi-lexical rules with the context variables given in Section  In our proposed approach either the causative or the lexicalization pattern bi-lexical rule, or both, incorporate a context variable in their output bilexical entry Via the bi-lexical rule given in Section , `march across' is approachred such that cruzar and marchando form part of the final TL bag Our main problem is that of resolving conflicts between the syntactic constraints imposed by each bi-lexical rule The causative rule requires the Spanish side to include an infinitive verb, while the lexicalization pattern rule requires a gerundive verb If the lexicalization pattern rule rather than the causative rule had included the contextual verb lexical sign, the gerundive marchando could not have been generated The implemented prototype system contains approximately 250 bilexical entries; this figure includes 20 proper names, 20 multi-lexeme translations and 6 contextual rules We have introduced the mechanism of bi-lexical rules for incorporating lexical rules in MT These rules establish correspondences between bilexical entries such that given the presence of one entry, the existence of another bilexical entry can be inferred The problems arising from conflicting constraints imposed by different translation relations are described, and a partial solution to these was offered involving the combined use of bi-lexical rules and contextual variables Future work could consider implementing Mel'cuk's lexical functions ( ( in a manner similar to the way bi-lexical rules were used in the translation of support verbs above  TFSs of type qualia encode lexical semantic information based on the Qualia structures of  A bilexical entry for `John - Juan' would be: For reasons of space and convenience, we will abbreviate the above lexical sign and bilexical entry to 1x john1x juan1xrespectively, where the subscripts correspond to the argument variable It should be emphasised, however, that this abbreviated notation implicitly includes syntactic and semantic information which may be accessed during approach or generation To exemplify LMT, consider the translation of `John likes Mary  Before approach, a process similar to skolemization is applied to the approach representation in order to replace variables by constants By using sets of lexical signs as their approach representation, LMT systems can reduce the difficulties posed by structural mismatches between two languages, thus increasing the independence between source and target approach representations For example, approach systems adopting a recursive representation for approach ( as opposed to a non-recursive one ( may need additional mechanisms for handling head switching (  One of the reasons for approach modules being expensive to construct is the presence of complex approach relations ( ,  One type of phenomena that leads to complex approach in a number of systems may be called multi-lexical translation For our implementation we have extended the original SB formulation by postulating bilingual lexical rules (bi-lexical rules henceforth) which dynamically expand the bilingual lexicon in order to extend its functionality Consider for example the case of `John is thirsty its Spanish translation, Juan tiene sed (lit During Spanish bag generation, the appropriate support verb (i A variation of this strategy would be to use a partially instantiated lexical sign corresponding to the English support verb: { john11 , support-verb2,1,3 , thirsty3 } During approach, the support verb is translated as a partially instantiated support verb in Spanish The generation algorithm would then be applied such that monolingual constraints in the Spanish grammar fully instantiated the semantics and orthography of this verb according to the support verb requirements of its complement noun The second mechanism for capturing multi-lexeme regularities assumes translation variables similar to those used in several approach systems ( , ,  If one represents approach variables by tr restrictions then the necessary bilexical entry would be: 1x,y,z, tr(Adjz) tener1x,y,z, tr(Nounz)This entry states that `be' translates as tener as long as its complement adjective translates as the complement noun of tener This is followed by a description of the problems posed by certain multi-lexeme translations, and of how bi-lexical rules, in conjunction with lexical semantic information provide a framework for overcoming these problems The main difference between this and the approach variable variant is that the contextual elements, Adj and Noun, can serve as context to multiple approach relations within the same cover, whereas this would not be possible with approach variables The third mechanism uses bilingual lexical rules to map bilexical entries into new bilexical entries Lexical rules may be thought of as establishing a relationship between lexical items such that given the presence of one lexical item in the lexicon the existence of a further item may be inferred A bi-lexical rule ( , ( takes a bilexical entry as input, and outputs a new bilexical entry These rules may be seen as expanding the bilexicon in order to increase its coverage; under this view, they are somewhat analogous to lexical rules in that they reduce the number of bilexical entries that need to be explicitly listed Bi-lexical rules also serve to capture lexical, syntactic and semantic regularities in the translation between two languages by relating equivalent lexical processes cross-linguistically We give a simple example of a bi-lexical rule before addressing the multi-lexeme translations introduced earlier Consider the relationship that exists in English-Spanish translations between the translation of fruits and The relevant relationship may be described by the following bi-lexical rule: This bi-lexical rule says that if there is a bilexical entry translating English fruit nouns into Spanish fruit nouns, then there is a bilexical entry translating `noun tree' in English into a morphologically derived tree-denoting noun in Spanish.
