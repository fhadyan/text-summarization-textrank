 Recall that the preference score for a given transfer candidate is a weighted sum of a channel contribution (discriminants on transfer rules) and a target language model score (discriminants from target language semantic triples  The transfer rule discriminants make transfer rules act more or less strongly as defaults The discriminant associated with the transfer rule that takes indefinite singular to indefinite singular is thus fairly strongly positive Similar considerations apply to prepositions This was then submitted to the transfer phase, and a set of transfer candidates produced A simple set of hand-coded transfer preferences was applied, and one French surface string was generated for each of the five highest-scoring transfer candidates Next, a set of possible target-language QLFs is created, using the unification-based transfer rules  The transfer rule score and the target language model score are computed using the same method; for clarity, we first describe this method with reference to transfer rules The transfer rule score for the bag of transfer rules used to produce a given target QLF is a sum of the discriminant scores for the individual transfer rules Ideally, we would like to say that unification-based rules and trainable transfer preferences constituted the whole transfer mechanism The following example illustrates how transfer packing works.
