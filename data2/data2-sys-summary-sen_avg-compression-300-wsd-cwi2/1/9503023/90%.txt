 The pattern matching capabilities of neural networks can be used to detect syntactic constituents of natural language The sentence is first decomposed into neural broad syntactic categories pre-subject - subject - predicate by locating neural subject At this stage neural data is ready to present to neural neural net The input to neural net is derived from neural candidate strings, neural sequences of tags and hypertags Multi-layer networks, which can process linearly inseparable data, were also investigated, but are not necessary for this particular processing task The net is presented with training strings whose desired classification has been manually marked Then a neural net selects neural string with neural correct placement It neuraln outlines neural neural net selection process correct- A also requires that neural words within neural subject are correctly tagged The core process is data driven, as neural parameters of neural neural networks are derived from training text2 and 3 If both positive and negative data is used, counter examples will reduce neural postulated grammar so that it is nearer neural real grammar However, for some processing steps we need to reduce neural number of candidate tag strings presented to neural neural network to manageable proportions (see Section  The data must be pre-processed by filtering through neural prohibition rule constraints If neural number of candidate strings is within desirable bounds, such as for neural head detection task, no rules are used Since data can be represented as higher order tuples, single layer networks can be used The most laborious part of this work is preparing neural training data We run marked up training data through an early version of neural network trained on neural same data, so neural results should be almost all correct Moreover, neuraly can utilise more of neural implicit information in neural training data by modelling negative relationships (1) This parser has been trained to find neural syntactic subject head that agrees in number with neural main verb Oneuralr words are tagged using suffix information, or else defaults are invoked It will take a sentence, locate neural subject and neuraln find neural head of neural subject However, some words will have more than one possible tag Since neuralre are 22 words (including punctuation ) neural total number of strings would be  For instance, neural subject must contain a noun-type word The grammatic framework alone does not reduce neural number of candidate strings sufficiently for neural subject detection stage These are adjacent tags which are not allowed, such as determiner - verb or start of subject - verb  By using neuralse methods neural number of candidate strings is drastically reduced.
