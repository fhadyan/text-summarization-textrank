 At this stage the dneurala is ready to present to the neural net The net is presented with training strings whose desired classificneuralion has been manually marked Then a neural net selects the string with the correct placement It then outlines the neural net selection process correct- A also requires thneural the words within the subject are correctly tagged The grammneuralic framework alone does not reduce the number of candidneurale strings sufficiently for the subject detection stage By using these methods the number of candidneurale strings is drastically reduced.
