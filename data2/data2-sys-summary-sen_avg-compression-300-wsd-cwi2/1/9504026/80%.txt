 The resulting DCG, FSA pair for phencyclidine_hydrochloride example PCP is given in figure : The question whephencyclidine_hydrochlorider phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection of a FSA and an off-line parsable DCG is empty is undecidable Suppose phencyclidine_hydrochloride problem was decidable The PCP problem however is known to be undecidable Hence phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection question is undecidable too Raphencyclidine_hydrochlorider than assuming phencyclidine_hydrochloride input for parsing is a FSA in its full generality, we might assume that phencyclidine_hydrochloride input is an ordinary word graph (a FSA without cycles  Completeness in this context means: phencyclidine_hydrochloride parse forest grammar contains all possible parses For any threshold it is phencyclidine_hydrochloride case that phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection problem of off-line parsable DCGs and FSA is decidable Soundness in this context should be understood as phencyclidine_hydrochloride property that all parse trees in phencyclidine_hydrochloride parse forest grammar are valid parse trees Then we compute phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection of phencyclidine_hydrochloride skeleton with phencyclidine_hydrochloride input FSA This results in a parse forest grammar Finally, we add phencyclidine_hydrochloride corresponding constraints from phencyclidine_hydrochloride DCG to phencyclidine_hydrochloride grammar rules of phencyclidine_hydrochloride parse forest grammar In this paper we investigate whephencyclidine_hydrochlorider phencyclidine_hydrochloride same techniques can be applied in case phencyclidine_hydrochloride grammar is a constraint-based grammar raphencyclidine_hydrochlorider than a CFG For specificity we will take phencyclidine_hydrochloride grammar to be a Definite Clause Grammar (DCG)  The calculation of phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection of a CFG and a FSA is very simple  Thus phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection of a FSA and a CFG is a CFG that exactly derives all parse-trees Such a grammar might be called phencyclidine_hydrochloride parse-forest grammar Parsing uncertain input might be necessary in case of ill-formed textual input, or in case of speech input In fact phencyclidine_hydrochloride (possibly enormously large) parse forest grammar might define an empty language (if phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection was empty  The predicate side_effect is used to construct phencyclidine_hydrochloride parse forest grammar In phencyclidine_hydrochloride parse-forest grammar, complex symbols are non-terminals, atomic symbols are terminals Next consider phencyclidine_hydrochloride definite clause specification of a FSA FSA of course generalizes such word lattices If our input `sentence' now is phencyclidine_hydrochloride definition of trans/3 as given above, we obtain phencyclidine_hydrochloride following parse forest grammar (where phencyclidine_hydrochloride start symbol is p(s,q0,q2 Thus, even though we now use phencyclidine_hydrochloride same parser for an infinite set of input sentences (represented by phencyclidine_hydrochloride FSA) phencyclidine_hydrochloride parser still is able to come up with a parse forest grammar A possible derivation for this grammar constructs phencyclidine_hydrochloride following (abbreviated) parse tree in figure  if phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection is empty we want an empty parse-forest grammar The same techniques that are used for calculating phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection of a FSA and a CFG can be applied in phencyclidine_hydrochloride case of DCGs In order to compute phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection of a DCG and a FSA we assume that FSA are represented as before A fortiori phencyclidine_hydrochloride problem of deciding whephencyclidine_hydrochlorider phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection of a FSA and a DCG is empty or not is undecidable I now show that phencyclidine_hydrochloride question whephencyclidine_hydrochlorider phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection of a FSA and an off-line parsable DCG is empty is undecidable A yes-no problem is undecidable (cf I use Post's Correspondence Problem (PCP) as a well-known undecidable problem First I give a simple algorithm to encode any instance of a PCP as a pair, consisting of a FSA and an off-line parsable DCG, in such a way that phencyclidine_hydrochloride question whephencyclidine_hydrochlorider phencyclidine_hydrochloridere is a solution to this PCP is equivalent to phencyclidine_hydrochloride question whephencyclidine_hydrochlorider phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection of this FSA and DCG is empty This FSA generates x  Observe that phencyclidine_hydrochloride DCG is off-line parsable.
