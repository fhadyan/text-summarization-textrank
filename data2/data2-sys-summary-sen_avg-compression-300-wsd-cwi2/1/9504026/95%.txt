 The resulting DCG, FSA pair for phencyclidine_hydrochloride example PCP is given in figure : The question whephencyclidine_hydrochlorider phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection of a FSA and an off-line parsable DCG is empty is undecidable For any threshold it is phencyclidine_hydrochloride case that phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection problem of off-line parsable DCGs and FSA is decidable Then we compute phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection of phencyclidine_hydrochloride skeleton with phencyclidine_hydrochloride input FSA This results in a parse forest grammar Finally, we add phencyclidine_hydrochloride corresponding constraints from phencyclidine_hydrochloride DCG to phencyclidine_hydrochloride grammar rules of phencyclidine_hydrochloride parse forest grammar Such a grammar might be called phencyclidine_hydrochloride parse-forest grammar Parsing uncertain input might be necessary in case of ill-formed textual input, or in case of speech input The predicate side_effect is used to construct phencyclidine_hydrochloride parse forest grammar FSA of course generalizes such word lattices if phencyclidine_hydrochloride intersection is empty we want an empty parse-forest grammar figure  This FSA generates x .
