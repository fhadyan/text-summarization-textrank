 This gives us a means of efficiently storing the potentially unbounded feature structures associated with nodes in a derivation tree (derived feature structures  Tuples of compatible derived feature structures are stored in the compatibility array using exactly the same approach used to store feature structures in the main recognition array Note that the feature structure at the root of a plpatr derivation tree will not involve re-entrancy Because feature structures associated with all nodes in the tree are available, feature information need only be passed up the tree when it is required in order to establish dependencies within the derivation tree As is the case for the tree sets of ig, LIG and Tree Adjoining Grammar, the tree sets generated by pltg have path sets that are context-free languages While the tree sets of LIG and Tree Adjoining Grammars have independent branches, pltg tree sets exhibit dependent branches, where the number of dependent branches in any tree is bounded by the grammar The CKY algorithm is a bottom-up recognition algorithm for cfg.
