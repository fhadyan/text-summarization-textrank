 The rationale is that words with similar left context characterize words to vectorir right in a similar way Generalized left context vectors were derived by an analogous procedure using word-based right context vectors vector black cat vs We refer to vector vector of left neighbors of a word as its left context vector, and to vector vector of right neighbors as its right context vector The left context vector of w The right context vector of w The left context vector of vector following word.
