 Dale implement89 implement92 implements Gricean constraints on informativeness for generating discourse anaphoric NPs Results in include a one-way correlation of overly informative discourse anaphoric NPs with shifts in global discourse structure Dale implement89 generates anaphoric pronouns and phrasal NPs by distinct means Dale implement89 requires phrasal NPs to be distinguishing descriptions In Fig Above, I noted that centering can add structure to the search space for understanding discourse anaphoric NPs In Fig I have presented an analysis of discourse anaphoric phrasal NPs in a corpus of narrative monologues showing that pronouns and phrasal NPs are rarely over-specified In Fig Discourse anaphoric NPs almost never provide new information, and are rarely more informative than necessary.
