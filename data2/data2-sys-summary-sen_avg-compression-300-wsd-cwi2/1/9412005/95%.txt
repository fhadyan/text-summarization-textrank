 Whereas the segmentation point data are inconclusive, word type data demonstrate that combining information sources is more useful than using distributional information aloneg `thekitty g Jusczyk et al 1993b  Two such hypotheses are: lexicons: frequent words combine Segmentation 2 yields a much larger lexicon of infrequent words 74-75  The lexicon lists words (represented as phoneme sequences) paired with their code after the other; the first column is called the word inventory column; the second column is called the code word inventory column The sample can be represented most compactly by assigning short code words to frequent words, reserving longer code words for infrequent words To satisfy this property, code words are assigned so that their lengths are frequency-based; the length of the code word for a word of frequency f(w) will not be greater than: The total length of the code word list is the sum of the code word lengths over all lexical entries: As in the word inventory column (described above the length of each code word is represented in a fixed-length field The total length of the representation of the entire hypothesis is the sum of the representation lengths of the word inventory column, the code word inventory column and the sample.
