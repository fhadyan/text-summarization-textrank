 Rather, discourse participants summarize the verbatim contents of a discourse segment by the discourse intention it satisfies Cue phrases are correlated with focusing operations The discourse intention of greatest scope is the Discourse Purpose (DP the reason for initiating a discourse campus The search for correlations among cue phrases, unfilled pauses and discourse structure generated three data collection tasks: Identification of cue phrases; Identification and measurement of unfilled pauses; Segmentation of the discourse via the identification of the focusing operations that effected the segmentation Attentional cues are especially important because topical relations do not always predict discourse structure In such discourse, domain and attentional hierarchies often coincide the relations among segments and of each segment to the overall Discourse Purpose are clear In prepared discourse (written or spoken) the intentional structure is tightly coupled to the Discourse Purposee current context) changes only from segment to segment In particular, the attentional state describes the processing of the discourse segment which has been introduced to satisfy the current discourse intention58, p =  For each focusing operation, the difference between mean pause durations at best only approaches significance (see Table [24  The minimal cue in this regard is the filled pause Cue phrases serve not only the listener but also the speaker The relationships among cue phrases, unfilled pauses and the structuring of discourse are investigated within the paradigm of the tripartite model of discourse Especially, the difficulty of utterance production might be explained by the complexity of the co-occurring focusing operation Thus, it treats the emerging discourse structure and the changing attentional foci as publicly accessible properties of the discourse The theory of the tripartite nature of discourse frames my hypotheses about the correlation of cue phrases, pause duration and discourse structure The correlation of unfilled pauses with attentional state is less certain because pauses appear at all levels of discourse structure In the theory of discourse structure, changes to the attentional state are modeled as operations on the focus space stack The relations among discourse intentions are captured in the intentional structure The study of cue phrases and their correlation with discourse structure and focus of attention is most extensive for the discourse marker SCHIFFRIN subcategory.
