 This paper has presented a new measure of semantic similarity in an IS-A taxonomy, based on the notion of information content Section sets up the probabilistic framework and defines the measure of semantic similarity in information-theoretic terms; Section presents an evaluation of the similarity measure against human similarity judgments, using the simple edge-counting method as a baseline; and Section discusses related work This quantitative characterization of information provides a new way to measure semantic similarity In practice, one often needs to measure word similarity, rather than concept similarity Although there is no standard way to evaluate computational measures of semantic similarity, one reasonable way to judge would seem to be agreement with human similarity ratings The first is the similarity measurement using information content proposed in the previous section One problem is that, like simple edge counting, the measure sometimes produces spuriously high similarity measures for words on the basis of inappropriate word senses For example, Table shows the word similarity for several words with tobacco.
