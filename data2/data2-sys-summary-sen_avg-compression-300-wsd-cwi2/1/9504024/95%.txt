 The error surface vowels are written in italics The morphological analysis proceeds by selecting rules that hypovowelsise lexical strings for a given surface string Variables introduced by error rules into vowel surface string are voweln instantiated by associating surface with lexical, and matching lexical strings to vowel lexicon tree(s  The error rules capture vowel correspondence between vowel error surface and vowel correct surface, given vowel surrounding partition into surface and lexical contexts The lexical level maintains three lexical tapes , : pattern tape, root tape and vocalism tape; each tape scans a lexical tree A vowel shift error rule will be tried with a partition on a (short) vowel which is not an expected (lexical) vowel at that position The rule deletes vowel vowel from vowel surface.
