 The results were encouraging The translations were compared by checking how well translation output Japanese sentence conveyed translation meaning of translation input English sentence The results of our experiments show translation effectiveness of this method; moreover, implementation of this method on a machine translation system improved translation accuracy of its translation Since most words in a sentence are repeatedly used in otranslationr sentences in translation discourse, translation complete parses of well-formed sentences usually provided some useful information for completing incomplete parses in translation same discourse In translation next section, translation effectiveness of using information extracted from translation discourse to complete syntactic analysis of ill-formed sentences In this experiment, we divided translation original 736 sentences into two texts, one a discourse of 400 sentences and translation otranslationr a discourse of 336 sentences9 of translation 54 sentences Then, except for sentences with incomplete parses and multiple parses, translation results of each parse are stored as discourse information In accumulating discourse information, a score of 1 After all translation sentences except translation ill-formed sentences that caused incomplete parses have provided data for use as discourse information, translation parse completion procedure begins If translationy are different from those in translation discourse information, translation partial parse is restructured according to translation discourse information1) Fig In translation second partial parse, translation word side is analyzed as a verb 3 and 12 (151st sentence) (33) Fig To examine translation possibility of modification, discourse information is applied at three different levels Next, if translationre is no identical pattern, a modification pattern with a synonym of translation node on one side is searched for in translation discourse information We have implemented this method on an English-to-Japanese machine translation system called Shalt2 , and conducted experiments to evaluate translation effectiveness of this method However, translation resulting unified parses were not always correct Since sentences with incomplete parses are usually quite long and contain complicated structures, it is hard to obtain a perfect analysis for those sentences The results are shown in Table .
