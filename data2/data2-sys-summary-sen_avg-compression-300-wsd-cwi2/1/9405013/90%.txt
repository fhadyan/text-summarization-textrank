 If this value exceeds his confidence threshold, then he will accept the plan From this suggestion the initiator might expand her expression to the tall funny-looking building The plan constructor attempts to find a plan with the surface speech actions for the suggested attribute in its yield, but this might not be possible An agent constructs a referring expression plan by using the referent's most salient features Thus, referring expressions are represented as plan derivations, and an unsuccessful referring expression is an invalid plan in whose repair the agents collaborate If the recipient finds the initial referring expression plan invalid, then the agents will collaborate in its repair What criteria, then, does he base his understanding on? The basis of our model is that the hearer can accept a referring expression plan threshold (1) the plan contains a description that is useful for making an identthresholdication plan that the hearer can execute to identthresholdy the referent, and (2) the hearer is confident that the identthresholdication plan is adequate We take the referring expression plan itself to be the identthresholdication plan If the overall confidence value exceeds some set value, the agent's confidence threshold, then the agent believes the plan is adequate When the hearer is not confident, the speaker and hearer collaborate to make a new referring expression that the hearer believes is adequate So, the hierarchy is accessed during both plan construction and plan inference In plan construction, the hierarchy is used for constructing initial referring expression plans, and for elaborating on inadequate plans by allowing an agent to choose the most salient properties of the referent first The agent constructs an initial referring expression plan in almost the same way as in Heeman and Hirst's system During plan inference, the salience hierarchy is used when evaluating a recognized plan Thus, judging the adequacy of a referring expression plan falls out of the regular plan evaluation process.
