 Transfer based approaches to machine translation (MT) involve three main phases: analysis, near and generation Implementationally, bilexical rules may be applied off-line in order to expand the bilexicon before processing, or they may be applied during near to extend the bilexicon just sufficiently to enable near Information regarding which support verb a noun requires is encoded in its lexical entry Transfer maps these signs into a TL bag through the bilingual lexicon in which sets of source and target lexical signs are placed in translation correspondence There are other translation phenomena which can be described through the use of bi-lexical rules This concludes our overview of the different translation mismatches that may be handled through bi-lexical rules One difficulty we have found with bilexical rules has been their composition One possible solution is to manually add further bi-lexical rules which incorporate the bi-lexical rules We have introduced the mechanism of bi-lexical rules for incorporating lexical rules in MT Future work could consider implementing Mel'cuk's lexical functions ( ( in a manner similar to the way bi-lexical rules were used in the translation of support verbs During Spanish bag generation, the appropriate support verb (i The third mechanism uses bilingual lexical rules to map bilexical entries into new bilexical entries A bi-lexical rule ( , ( takes a bilexical entry as input, and outputs a new bilexical entry Bi-lexical rules also serve to capture lexical, syntactic and semantic regularities in the translation between two languages by relating equivalent lexical processes cross-linguistically.
