 There are different types of text Texts vary along several parameters, all relevant for the general information retrieval problem of matching reader needs and texts Miscellaneous the most problematic category, is a loose grouping of different informative texts We discuss how well this method categorizes a set text, given a set of categories, and given a set of parameters Certain parameters probably vary more in certain text types than others, and they may have a skewed distribution as well General text types may be useful, but quite probably tough will be a domain- or field-specific text typology The project uses categories such as query comment announcement FAQ and so forth, categorizing them using parameters such as different types of length measures, form word content, quote level, percentage quoted text and other USENET News specific parameters Douglas Biber has studied text variation along several parameters, and found that texts can be considered to vary along five dimensions.
