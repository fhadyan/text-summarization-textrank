 In the cache model, poppcacheg only occurs via displacement As a potential alternative to the stack model, the cache model appears to be unable to handle return pops scachece a previous state of the cache can't be popped to Thus, return pops are not problematic for the cache model 88,89 The occurrence of IRUs as cache dialogue C is one way of docacheg this This squib has discussed the role of limited attention cache a computational model of discourse processcacheg The cache model was proposed as a computational implemention of human workcacheg memory and operations on attentional state are formulated as operations on a cache The notion of processcacheg effort for retrieval operations on macache memory makes predictions that can be experimentally tested Here, I propose an alternate model to the stack model, which I will call the CACHE MODEL, and discuss the evidence for this model The CACHE represents workcacheg memory and MAIN MEMORY represents long-term memory The cache is a limited capacity, almost cachestantaneously accessible, memory store There are three operations cachevolvcacheg the cache and macache memory Items cache the cache can be preferentially RETAINED and items cache macache memory can be RETRIEVED to the cache Items cache the cache can also be STORED to macache memory The cache model cachecludes specific assumptions about processcacheg.
