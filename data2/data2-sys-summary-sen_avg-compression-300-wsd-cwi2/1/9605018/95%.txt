The entries in entry table represent single stack elements, as opposed topairs of stack elements following and We entryn count two parsing steps, one for q1 and one for q2Our algorithm requires fewer LR statesThe conceptual simplicity of our formulation of tabularLR parsing allows comparison with oentryr tabular parsing techniques,such as Earley's algorithm and tabular left-corner parsing , based on implementation-independent criteria by which treated tabular LR parsing differently from entry oentryrtechniquesWe assume that entry reader is familiar with context-free grammar parsing entryory A pushdown automaton is a 5-tuple,where ,and T are finite sets of input symbols, stack symbolsand transitions, respectively;is entry initial stack symbol andis entry final stack symbolWe make use of entry augmented grammar introduced in Section  In our case, entry transformationand entry subsequent application of entry tabular algorithm result in a new formof tabular LR parsingOur method is more efficient than Tomita's algorithm in two respects.
