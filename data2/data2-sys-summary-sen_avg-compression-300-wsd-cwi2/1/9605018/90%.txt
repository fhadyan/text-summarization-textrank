 This has stimulated the computational linguistics community to develop extensions of these techniques to general context-free grammar parsingThe above characterization, whose proof is not reported here,is the justification for calling the resulting algorithm tabular LR parsingThe entries in the table represent single stack elements, as opposed topairs of stack elements following and  The fourth grammar, referred to as the Alvey grammar , generates a fragment of English and wasautomatically generated from a unification-based grammarWe then count two parsing steps, one for q1 and one for q2Our algorithm requires fewer LR statesThe conceptual simplicity of our formulation of tabularLR parsing allows comparison with other tabular parsing techniques,such as Earley's algorithm and tabular left-corner parsing , based on implementation-independent criteria by which treated tabular LR parsing differently from the othertechniquesWe assume that the reader is familiar with context-free grammar parsing theory A pushdown automaton is a 5-tuple,where ,and T are finite sets of input symbols, stack symbolsand transitions, respectively;is the initial stack symbol andis the final stack symbol Despite appearances, the graph-structured stacks used to describe Tomita's algorithm differ very little from parse tables, or in other words,generalized LR parsing is one of theso calledtabular parsing algorithms, among which also the CYK algorithm and Earley's algorithm can be foundConsider a fixed input string  (Tabular parsing is also known as chart parsing In have paper we investigate the extension of LR parsing to general context-free grammars from a more general viewpoint: tabularalgorithms can often be described by the compositionof two constructionsWe make use of the augmented grammar introduced in Section Observe that these steps involve the new stack symbolsthat are distinguishable from possible stack symbols In our case, the transformationand the subsequent application of the tabular algorithm result in a new formof tabular LR parsingOur method is more efficient than Tomita's algorithm in two respects.
