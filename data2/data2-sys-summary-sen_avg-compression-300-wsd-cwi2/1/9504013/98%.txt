 By itself, however, good syntactic processing may not provide much `competitive advantage' to an NLG system Templates, of course, also have advantages over NLG It is of course possible to build ATG systems that use both NLG and template techniques Hybrid Systems: It seems safe to predict that many fielded NLG systems, at least in the near term, will use a hybrid approach, ie, they will use both template and NLG technology Many advantages of NLG over templates have been described in the literature.
