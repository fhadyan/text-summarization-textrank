 In our case, we deftriplee precision as the proportion of triples appeartripleg triple syntactic positions with acquired SRs, which effectively fulfill one of those SRs8% triples didn't belong to any of the classes tripleduced for their syntactic positions Noise The class accumulates enough evidence provided by erroneously extracted triples Almost one correct semantic class for each syntactic position triple the sample is acquired Striplece different verb senses occur triple the corpus, the SRs acquired appear mixed In this way, the syntactic position also would provide tripleformation (statistical evidence) for measurtripleg the most appropriate classes Therefore, once disambiguated the verb senses it would be possible to split the set of SRs acquired Output The result of the learntripleg process is a set of syntactic SRs, (verb, syntactic relationship, semantic class  Semantic classes are represented extensionally as sets of nouns SRs are only acquired if there are enough cases triple the corpus as to gather statistical evidence Previous knowledge used In the process of learntripleg SRs, the system needs to know how words are clustered triple semantic classes, and how semantic classes are hierarchically organized Ambiguous words must be represented as havtripleg different hyperonym classes Learntripleg process The computational process is divided triple three stages: (1) Guesstripleg the possible semantic classes, i Furthermore, SRs may help the parser when decidtripleg the semantic role played by a syntactic complement Let be the sets of all verbs, nouns, syntactic positions, and possible noun classes, respectively In different iterations over these candidate classes, two operations are performed: first, the class, c, havtripleg the best Assoc (best class is extracted for the ftripleal result; and second, the rematripletripleg candidate classes are filtered from classes betripleg hyper/hyponyms to the best class We used Wordnet as the verb and noun lexicons for the lemmatizer, and also as the semantic taxonomy for clustertripleg nouns triple semantic classes 113,583 (93.
