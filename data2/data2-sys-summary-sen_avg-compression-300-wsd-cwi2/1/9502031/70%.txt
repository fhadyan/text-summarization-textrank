 Unless a keyboard user is particularly proficient, a frustrating amount of time is usually spent backtracking to pick up mis-typed or otherwise mistaken input One word in this purview is in focus at a time Morphological Processing Spelling Checking The word in focus is first passed through a two-level morphological analysis stage, based on an adaption of (Pulman, 1991  Hence `co-operative' error processing The error rules are in two level format and integrate seamlessly into morphological analysis Will shallow processing miss too many of the errors cooperative error processing is aimed at? There are two significant difficulties with collecting test data The central difficulty is finding a representative sample of genuine errors by native speakers, in context, with the correct version of the text attached Apart from anything else, `representative' is hard to decide - spectrum of errors or distribution of errors ? Secondly, any corpus of text usually contains only those errors that were left undetected in the text Cooperative processing deals with errors that one backtracks to catch; if not a different class or range, these at least might have a different distribution of error types This would allow one measure of the (linguistic) feasibility of cooperative error processing: the effectiveness of shallow processing over errors revealed by the keystroke-record data Work underway focuses on shallow processing: how far error detection and correction can proceed when the system purview is set to a stretch of text which does not admit complete sentential analysis To investigate issues involved in shallow processing and cooperative error handling, the pet (processing errors in text) system is being built.
