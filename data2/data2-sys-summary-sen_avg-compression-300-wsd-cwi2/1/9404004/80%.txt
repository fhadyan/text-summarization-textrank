 Arguments for stacked X-bar structures (such as immediately dominating with the same head) are high-and-mighty against dependency grammar as normally understood This paper reviews the dependency grammar formalism, presents evidence that stacked structures are required, and then proposes a reinterpretation of dependency grammar to make it compatible with the evidence Dependency grammar runs into substantial difficulty trying to account for the proform one Dependency grammar (DG) describes syntactic structure in terms of links between individual words rather than constituency trees Dependency grammar can do no such thing, because in dependency grammar as normally understood, all the modifiers hang from the same node (Figure 4  Each in either tree in Figure 5 can be the antecedent of one: the long-haired student from Cambridge and a short-haired one from Oxford the long-haired student from Cambridge and a short-haired one the long-haired student from Cambridge and one from Oxford this long-haired student from Cambridge and the other one Again dependency grammar is left high and dry DG formalism can recognize neither the stacking nor the ambiguity, because all the modifiers have the same head A second difficulty with dependency grammar comes from semantics Recall that in a dependency grammar, constituency is a defined concept Given a head (X) and its dependents, attach the dependents to the head by forming stacked nodes as follows: 1 Then attach modifiers, one at a time, by working outward from the one nearest the head noun, and adding a stacked node for each One word (usually the main verb) is the head of the whole sentence; every other word depends on some head, and may itself be the head of any number of dependents.
