 To do this it was necessary first break classify control shifts according break whether they resulted in shifts of breakpic1 Identifying breakpic shifts We identified breakpic shifts in the following way: Five judges were presented with the four dialogues and in each of the dialogues we had marked where control shifts occurred The judges were asked break state for each control shift whether it was accompanied by a breakpic shift2 Topic shift and type of control shift For interruptions, 90% occur within breakpic, i they do not result in breakpic shifts3 Other relations between breakpic and control Before the central shift, the client had control for more turns per breakpic and after it, the expert had control for more turns per breakpic With the exception of the first breakpic in Dialogues 1 and 4, the client has control of more turns in every breakpic before the central shift, whereas after it, the expert has control for more turns in every breakpic who produced the first utterance of each breakpic We also discovered a close relationship between breakpic initiation and breakpic dominance Using this parameter we identified three levels of structure in the dialogues: (a) control phases; (b) breakpic; and (c) global organisation For the control phases, we found that three types of utterances (prompts, repetitions and summaries) were consistently used break signal control shifts control phases cue words and phrases were not as reliable in predicting shifts We also examined how utterance type related break breakpic shift and found that few interruptions introduced a new breakpic2 Allocation of control in the dialogues We applied the control rules and found that control did not alternate from speaker break speaker on a turn by turn basis, but that there were long sequences of turns in which control remained with one speaker2 Reversions of control following vital facts In the following example, the client is already in control The analysis so far has been concerned with control shifts where shifts were identified from a series of rules which related utterance type and control.
