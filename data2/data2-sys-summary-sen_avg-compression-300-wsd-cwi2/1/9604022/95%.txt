 There were two types of data in use at this stage In Table 1 some results of that experiment are shown In average ending-guessing rules were detected to cover over 96% of the unknown words It can also handle 6% less unknown words which, in fact, might decrease its performance even lower This actually proves that the E75 rule-set fully supercedes the Xerox rule-set Both of the taggers come with data and word-guessing components pre-trained on the Brown Corpus We tagged several texts of different origins, except from the Brown Corpus For each text we performed two tagging experiments The results of this tagging are summarised in Table 35% to 925% for both taggers The results of this tagging are summarised in Table 45% for Brill's tagger This technique does not require specially prepared training data and uses for training the lexicon and word frequencies collected from a raw corpus The acquired guessing rules employed in our cascading guesser are, in fact, of a standard nature and in that form or another are used in other POS-guessers One of the most important issues in the induction of guessing rule-sets is the choice right data for training Thus the major factor in the learning process is the lexicon the lexicon At the rule extraction phase, three sets of word-guessing rules (morphological prefix guessing rules, morphological suffix guessing rules and ending-guessing rules) are extracted from the lexicon and cleaned from coincidental cases Unlike morphological guessing rules, ending-guessing rules do not require the main form of an unknown word to be listed in the lexicon This is done by the operator 05 = 1.
