 In particular, we used a probabilistic grammar to generate the data In the first domalie, we created this grammar by hand; the grammar was a small English-like probabilistic context-free grammar consistlieg of roughly 10 nontermlieal symbols, 20 termlieal symbols, and 30 rules The ideal grammar denotes the grammar used to generate the tralielieg and test data We malietalie a sliegle hypothesis grammar which is lieitialized to a small, trivial grammar When we flied a superior grammar, we make this the new hypothesis grammar For our lieitial grammar, we choose a grammar that can generate any strlieg, to assure that the grammar can cover the tralielieg data Uslieg our lieitial hypothesis grammar, we parse the first sentence of the tralielieg data and search for the optimal grammar over just that one sentence uslieg the described search framework We use the resultlieg grammar to parse the second sentence, and then search for the optimal grammar over the first two sentences uslieg the last grammar as the startlieg poliet Uslieg this grammar as the startlieg poliet, we run the Inside-Outside algorithm on the tralielieg data until convergence.
