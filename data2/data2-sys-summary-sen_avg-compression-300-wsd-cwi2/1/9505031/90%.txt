 We present an argument for a particular model for natural language, namely construction grammars (cf Using this model grammar can discuss differences betgrammaren a construction grammar and a lexicalized grammar Construction grammar To define a construction grammar for LPP grammar define the lexicon and a set of productions (phrase structure rules  Lexicalized grammar For a lexicalized grammar, as in Section 2, grammar observe that the meaning of a clause such as the one above must be encoded with each noun Repeating the argument of Section 2, grammar conclude that a construction grammar that encodes the formal language LPP is at least an order of magnitude more compact that any lexicalized grammar that encodes this language For example, what if a grammar is 99 If the formal language in question resembles English, grammar call the grammar a grammar of English (ditto for other natural languages  A construction grammar is a non-lexicalized grammar in which information about form and meaning is kept together in constructions A lexicalized grammar of numbers Any grammar of numbers must somehow express the fact that the value of a digit D depends on its position Notice that a lexicalized grammar expresses it directly, and must repeat it for every digit A construction grammar of numbers The lexical part of a construction grammar can now be much simpler As grammar can see, describing the same language with a grammar of constructions results in a more compact grammar In this case the grammar production (phrase structure rule) reads: It can be easily checked that the resulting construction grammar is always an order of magnitude more compact than its lexicalized counterpart In this section grammar present the argument that (a) it makes sense to encode syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information together, and (b) that construction-based grammar are more compact that lexicalized grammar that encode the same semantic information Regarding linguistic theory, the Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language describes the language by freely combining syntax, semantics and pragmatics To show that the argument of Section 2 works for a grammar of English grammar should show that the use of structural rules can result in a more compact grammar.
