 Rather than interpreting node definitions (in a given global context) as partial functions from paths to values (i Now suppose that is the function associated with the node definition in a given DATR interpretation For example, atoms now denote constant functions: More generally, value descriptors will denote different values for different paths Section presents the syntax of the DATR language and introduces the notion of a DATR theory In principle, a DATR theory may consist of any combination of DATR sentences, either definitional or extensional, but in practice, DATR theories are more restricted than this In the remainder of this paper we will use the term (DATR) theory always in the sense functional, definitional (DATR) theory Implicit specification is achieved via DATR 's default mechanism More generally, the global context is used to fill in the missing node (path) when a global path (node) is encountered the value associated with in the prevailing global context  DATR theories can be viewed semantically as collections of definitions of partial functions nodes' in DATR parlance) that map paths onto values.
