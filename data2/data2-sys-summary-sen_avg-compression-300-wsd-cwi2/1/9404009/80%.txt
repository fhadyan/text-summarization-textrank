 Before we look at quantifier scope ambiguity and interactions between scope and bound anaphora, we demonstrate the basic operation of our proposed representation of the semantic contribution of a determiner Scope ambiguities are manifested in two different ways in our system: through the choice of different semantic structures H, corresponding to different syntactic choices for where to scope the quantifier, or through different relative orders of quantifiers that scope at the same point The semantic contribution of the pronoun is, then, a formula that consumes the meaning of its antecedent and then reintroduces that meaning, simultaneously assigning it to its own semantic projection: In other words, the semantic contribution of a pronoun copies the meaning X of its antecedent as the meaning of the pronoun itself LFG assumes two syntactic levels of representation: constituent structure (c-structure) represents phrasal dominance and precedence relations, while functional structure (f-structure) represents syntactic predicate-argument structure Our approach exploits the f-structure of LFG for syntactic information needed to guide semantic composition, and also exploits the resource-sensitive properties of linear logic to express the semantic composition requirements of natural language The use of linear logic as the glue language in a deductive semantic framework allows a natural treatment of quantification which automatically gives the right results for quantifier scope ambiguities and interactions with bound anaphora The meaning language is based on Montague's intensional higher-order logic The glue language refers to three kinds of terms: meaning terms, f-structures, and semantic or -structures These two phrase structure rules do not encode semantic information; they specify only how grammatical functions such as are expressed in English The relation between the nodes of the c-structure and the f-structure for the sentence is expressed by means of arrows in (1 Unlike phrase structure rules, lexical entries specify semantic as well as syntactic information The syntactic information given in lexical entries consists of equality statements about the f-structure, while the semantic information consists of assertions about how the meaning of the f-structure participates in various semantic relations The semantic information in a lexical entry, which we will call the semantic contribution of the entry, is a linear-logic formula that constrains the association between semantic structures projected from the f-structures mentioned in the lexical entry , and their semantic interpretations The semantic projection function maps an f-structure to a semantic structure encoding information about its meaning, in the same way as the functional projection function maps c-structure nodes to the associated f-structures We will see, however, that f-structures and their semantic projections must be distinguished, because in general semantic projections carry more information than just the association to the meaning for the corresponding f-structure We can now explain the semantic contributions in  Those accounts therefore force the adoption of categorial syntactic analyses, with their strong dependence on phrase structure and linear order The semantic contribution of the appointed entry is more complex, as it relates the meanings of the subject and object of a clause to the clause's meaning Specifically, if f is the f-structure for a clause with predicate ( ) `appoint the semantic contribution asserts that if f's subject has meaning X and (linear conjunction ) f's object has meaning Y, then (linear implication ) f has meaning  In contrast, our approach uses linear logic to represent the connection between two dissimilar levels of representation, LFG f-structures and their semantic interpretations The glue language, described below, is a fragment of linear logic The semantic contribution of each lexical entry is represented by a linear-logic formula that can be understood as instructions in the glue language for combining the meanings of the lexical entry's syntactic arguments into the meaning of the f-structure headed by the entry F-structures provide a crosslinguistically uniform representation of syntactic information relevant to semantic interpretation that abstracts away from the details of phrase structure and linear order in particular languages Instead, the semantic contributions are occurrences of information which are generated and used exactly once For example, the formula can be thought of as providing one occurrence of the meaning associated to the semantic projection  It is this resource-sensitivity of natural language semantics an expression is used exactly once in a semantic derivation that linear logic can model The extraction of meanings from derivations following the Curry-Howard isomorphism that is standard in categorial systems demands that the order of syntactic combination coincide with the order of semantic combination so that functor-argument relations at the syntactic and semantic level are properly aligned The generalized quantifier meaning of a natural language determiner has the following type, a function from two properties, the quantifier's restriction and scope, to a proposition: At the semantic glue level, we can understand that type as follows In addition to providing a semantic type assignment for determiners, uses glue language quantification to express how the meanings of the restriction and scope of quantification are determined and combined into the meaning of the quantified clause The condition We first demonstrate how the semantic contribution of a quantified noun phrase such as every voter is derived The f-structure for the noun phrase every voter is: The semantic contributions of common nouns and determiners were described in the previous section Given those entries, the semantic contributions of every and voter in are From these two premises, the semantic contribution for every voter follows: The propositional part of this contribution corresponds to the standard type for noun phrase meanings,  Informally, the whole contribution can be read as follows: if by giving the arbitrary meaning x of type e to the argument position filled by the noun phrase we can derive the meaning S x of type tfor the semantic structure scope of quantification H, then S can be the property that the noun phrase meaning requires as its scope, yielding the meaning for H.
