 Instead of generating four separate messages as in Fig This is done by grouping messages with the same action attribute Though this heuristic disallows the combination of messages with different actions, the messages in each action group already contain enough information to produce quite complex sentences Sorting: putting similar messages right next to each other Merging Same Attribute: combining adjacent messages that only have one distinct attribute Identity Deletion: deletion of identical components across messages Combining messages according to the highest ranking attribute ensures that minimum text will be generated for these messages Attribute class and action (Fig The list of sorted messages is traversed Whenever there is only one distinct attribute between two adjacent messages, they are merged into one message with a conjoined attribute, which is a list of the distinct attributes from both messages Once the distinct attributes are different from the combined messages, the system starts a new sentence They are combined because they are the first two messages.
