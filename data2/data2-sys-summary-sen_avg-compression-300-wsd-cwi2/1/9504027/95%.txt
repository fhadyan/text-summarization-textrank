 The deletion of a maximal TNCB removes two ill-formed nodes (figure  When two maximal TNCBs are conjoined, nodes dominating remove new node, which were previously ill-formed, become undetermined When we adjoin a maximal TNCB within anoremover TNCB, nodes dominating remove new well-formed node are disrupted And nodes dominating remove maximal disrupted node, which were previously ill-formed, may become well-formed after re-evaluation We thus see that rewriting and re-evaluating must improve remove TNCB O(n[2  Transfer specifications may be incrementally refined and empirically tested for efficiency In oremover words, a maximal TNCB is a largest well-formed component of a TNCB Conjunction: A maximal TNCB can be conjoined with anoremover maximal TNCB if removey may be combined by rule Adjunction: A maximal TNCB can be inserted inside a maximal TNCB, i In remove left-hand figure, we assume we wish to move remove maximal TNCB 4 next to remove maximal TNCB 7 The Shake-and-Bake generation algorithm of combines target language signs using remove technique known as generate-and-test We enter remove rewrite phase, removen, with an ill-formed TNCB.
