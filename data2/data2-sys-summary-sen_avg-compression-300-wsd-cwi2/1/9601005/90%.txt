 Several methods to capture segment boundaries have been proposed in the studies of text structure One of the constituents of the text structure is a text segment LCP of the text is a sequence of lexical cohesiveness c(Si  Figure 2 Correlation between LCP and text segments This paper proposes an indicator, called the lexical cohesion profile (LCP which locates segment boundaries in a narrative text LCP is a record of lexical cohesiveness of words in a sequence of text Note that LCP can detect segment changing of a text regardless of its paragraph structure This paper proposed LCP, an indicator of segment changing, which concentrates on lexical cohesion of a text segment Analyzing text structure: Segment boundaries can be considered as segment switching (push and pop) in hierarchical structure of text The segmentation can be applied also to text summarizing.
