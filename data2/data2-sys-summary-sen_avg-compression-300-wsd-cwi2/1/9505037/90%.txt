 This assumption is reasonable for parallel texts Starting from an English vocabulary of six words and the corresponding German translations, table and b show an English and a German co-occurrence matrix Word n in the English matrix is then the translation of word n in the German matrix The word co-occurrences were computed on the basis of an English corpus of 33 and a German corpus of 46 million words Equivalently, the German co-occurrence matrix was created by counting the co-occurrences of German word pairs in the German corpus As a starting point, word order in the two matrices was chosen such that word n in the German matrix was the translation of word n in the English matrix The simulation was conducted by randomly permuting the word order of the German matrix and then computing the similarity s to the English matrix.
