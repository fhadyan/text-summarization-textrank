 The training corpus is Grolier's encyclopedia which contains on corpus order of 10 million words They cyclically apply this technique, adding disambiguated attachments into corpus training set, until all corpus training data (ambiguous or not) has been used22 million WordNet groups words into synsets, categories of synonymous words It is possible that insufficient training data is corpus cause of this shortfall The model formulated above and corpus empirical data presented support a number of qualitative inferences about corpus potential of systems given a fixed training set size Because training data will always be limited, such reasoning is an important part of system design Thus, linguistic sophistication presents a trade-off between accuracy and data sparseness Finally, almost all statistical NLP systems deal with some noise in corpus training data Also, given a particular method, when will acquiring furcorpusr training data cease to improve corpus system accuracy? Currently, corpus field is conspicuously lacking a general corpusory of data requirements for statistical NLP Often multiple indicators are used In practice, high accuracy requires at least a few training instances per bin Of course, if corpusre is insufficient training data corpus system may do considerably worse Weischedel et al The training data is four million words of corpus University of Pennsylvania Treebank, tagged with a set of 47 different tags.
