 Otherwise, the normal parser fails, and then the robust parser starts to execute with edges generated by the normal parser These removed rules are almost for peculiar sentences and the left rules are very general rules Of these sentences, 410 are failed in normal parsing, and are processed again by the robust parser Among 1,000 sentences from the ATIS, 465 sentences are processed by the robust parser after the failure of the normal parsing Table shows the results of the robust parser on WSJ With heuristics, our robust parser can enhance the processing time and reduce the number of edges The experiment says that our robust parser with heuristics can recover perfectly about 23 sentences out of 100 sentences which are just failed in normal parsing, as the percentage of no-crossing sentences is about 23 Our robust parser can recover these extragrammatical sentences with 68 77% accuracy To enhance the performance of the robust parser for extragrammatical sentences, we proposed several heuristics The heuristics assign the error values to each error-hypothesis edge, and edges which has less error values are processed first The robust parser using the extended least-errors recognition algorithm overgenerates many error-hypothesis edges during parsing process Heuristics 1: error types The analysis on 3,538 sentences of the Penn treebank corpus WSJ shows that there are 498 sentences with phrase deletions and 224 sentences with phrase insertions When handling sentences, the robust parser assings more error values( ) to the error hypothesis edge occurring within a fiducial nonterminal So, the robust parser assigns less error values( ) to the error hypothesis edges with these symbols than to the other terminal symbols All error values are additive One module is a normal parser which is the bottom-up chart parser The other is a robust parser with the error recovery mechanism proposed herein.
