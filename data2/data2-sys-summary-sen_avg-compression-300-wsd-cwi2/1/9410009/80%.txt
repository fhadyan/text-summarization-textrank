 Collocations present specific problems in translation, both in human and automatic contexts It is essentially in addressing the issue of overgenerality that Mel'cuk introduces sub- and superscripts to lexical functions, enhancing their precision and making them sensitive to meaning aspects of the lexical items over which they operateg ( ( that collocational systems are systematically predictable from the lexical semantics of nouns We consider one case briefly One way to emulate such a mapping might be through the use of Mel'cuk's lexical paraphrasing rules For instance, one could conceive of a lexical paraphrasing rule as follows:  Again, we suggest the use of merged LFs and corresponding mappings via lexical paraphrasing rules as a possible translation strategy in these cases In this paper we have discussed how the lexicographical concept of lexical functions, introduced by Mel'cuk to describe juxtaposition, can be used as an interlingual device in the machine translation of such structures We have been concerned with investigating the lexical functions (LFs) of Mel'cuk ( ) as a candidate interlingual device for the translation of adjectival and verbal collocates Our use of lexical functions as an interlingua assumes that the relevant aspects of the meaning of the collocate are fully captured by the LF We have suggested some ways in which LFs can be enriched with lexical semantic information to improve translation quality Given that juxtaposition may translate as non-juxtaposition, we also have to provide a way to represent these expressions using lexical functions The use we make of lexical functions as interlingual representations, does not respect their original Mel'cukian interpretation In the lexical combinatorics zone, we find a list of the lexical functions that are relevant to this particular lexeme Each lexical function is followed by one or more lexemes (the result or value of the function applied to the head word  The argument corresponds to the base and each value is a collocate Lexical functions are used to represent an important syntactico-semantic relation between the base and the collocate Mel'cuk deals with this by including in the ECD an entry for the free variant and putting the collocate-specific information in the entry for the base (with the result of the lexical functions  Choosing the level at which lexical functions will be situated Relating the collocate information to the free variant entry As far as the second problem is concerned, the obvious place to put lexical functions is in the semantic representation provided by HPSG In contrast to the ECD, the meaning of the collocate is represented by the lexical function only In our case, the feature ` COLLS' has a set of lexical entries as its value Each collocate subentry bears the value of the lexical function in its semantics field In this representation the lexical function is chosen as the real semantic value of the collocate The collocate subentry only provides partial information The adjunct daughter will contain the adjective collocate The project has tried to investigate the use of lexical functions as an interlingual device, i This information is used to generate the correct translation in the target language This treatment of juxtaposition rests, among others, on the assumptions that there are only a limited number of lexical functions, that lexical functions can be assigned consistently, that all (or a significant number of) juxtaposition realise a lexical function, that lexical functions are not restricted to particular languages, etc Thus, for translating heavy smoker into grand fumeur we will need the obvious entry for smoker-fumeur plus the entry below: The interlingual status of the lexical function is self-evident Lexical Functions abstract away from certain nuances in meaning and from different syntactic realizations An important problem stems from the interpretation of LFs implied by their use as an interlingua namely that the meaning of the collocate in some ways reduces to the meaning implied by the lexical function.
