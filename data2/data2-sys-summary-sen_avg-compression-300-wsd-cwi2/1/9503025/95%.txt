 For the word sense disambiguation based on the context similarity, co-occurrence vectors from the 1987 Wall Street Journal (20M total words) was advantageous over distance vectors from the Collins English Dictionary ( head words + definition words  For learning or meanings from example words, distance vectors gave remarkably higher precision than co-occurrence vectors ) is used to measure the distance between words The words in Fig We used the same set of origin words as similarity the distance vectors Co-occurrence Vector With WSD, the precision by using co-occurrence vectors from a 20M words corpus was higher than by using distance vectors from the CED.
