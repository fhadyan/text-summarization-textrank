 where the phrase key for each text contains a set of phrases and the coreference links among them However, evaluation of coreference performance is complicated by the need to take into account the implicit coreference links among phrasese what fraction of correct coreference links is implied by the transitive closure of the coreference links in the system response RESOLVE used the C45 decision tree system to learn how to classify coreferent phrases for the experiments reported in this paper An experiment was conducted to compare the performance of the decision trees generated by RESOLVE with the performance of manually engineered rules used for coreference classification in the UMass/Hughes MUC-5 IE system The pairings that contained coreferent phrases formed positive instances, while those that contained two non-coreferent phrases formed negative instancesg people The phrases underlined in this sentence contain relevant information that must be extracted by an IE system Some phrases are multireferent, i The coreference module of the UMass/Hughes MUC-5 IE system was designed to minimize false positives, i The rules used to determine whether two phrases (represented as memory tokens) were coreferent in the MUC-5 system are shown in Table .
