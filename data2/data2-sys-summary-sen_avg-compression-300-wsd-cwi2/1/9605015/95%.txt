 Section describes the French morphology rules Figure presents examples illustrating the main French question constructions In French, the corresponding feature has five values: inverted, uninverted, est_ce_que, complex and pseudo, distinguishing clauses formed using the different question-formation constructions Sections and describe the French and Spanish grammars In particular, the English semantic rules can still be used, and produce QLF representations with similar form More specifically, we introduce two sets of new rules In general, the Spanish rules were distinctly simpler than the French ones In a little more detail: Question-formation: The Spanish rules for question-formation are similar to, but less elaborate than the French ones Clitics: The Spanish clitic system is also considerably simpler than the French one9 this only involved moving the relevant syntax rules to the morphology rule file Syntax: Syntax rules are written in a unification-based feature-grammar formalism When adapting the system to French and Spanish, the problems arose almost exclusively in connection with morphology and syntax rules Two-level spelling rules were also used to describe the inter-word effects that are particularly common in French The total number of rules required to describe inflectional morphology was around 75 for French and 50 for Spanish (inter-word rules being responsible for much of the difference  Intra-word spelling changes for French present several problems not encountered in English inflectional morphology In particular, French exhibits many multiple letter changes, e When comparing the French and English grammars, there are two types of objects of immediate interest: syntax rules and features Of the remainder, some rules (e.
