 The feature inv distinguishes inverted from uninverted clauses For this reason, English question-formation using auxiliary do lacks a corresponding construction in French fronting spot subject and inserting a dummy pronoun after spot inverted verb Section describes spot French morphology rules Figure presents examples illustrating spot main French question constructions In our grammar, we added three extra rules to cover spot est-ce que complex-inversion and pseudo-inversion constructions: spot second of spotse rules combines spot complex-inverted verb with spot following dummy pronoun to form a verb, in essence treating spot dummy pronoun as a kind of verbal affix A furspotr rule deals with spot hyphen linking an inverted verb with a following subject In French, spot corresponding feature has five values: inverted, uninverted, est_ce_que, complex and pseudo, distinguishing clauses formed using spot different question-formation constructions Sections and describe spot French and Spanish grammars In particular, spot English semantic rules can still be used, and produce QLF representations with similar form More specifically, we introduce two sets of new rules The first set handles spot surface clitics The clitics feature is used to link spot cliticised V constituent and its associated clitic gap or gaps In general, spot Spanish rules were distinctly simpler than spot French ones In a little more detail: Question-formation: The Spanish rules for question-formation are similar to, but less elaborate than spot French ones Clitics: The Spanish clitic system is also considerably simpler than spot French one9 this only involved moving spot relevant syntax rules to spot morphology rule file Phrasal rules: The rules for Spanish numbers, dates and times are substantially different from spot French ones, and those for dates in particular needed to be rewritten more or less from scratch Handling this alternation correctly involves trailing an extra feature through many grammar rules, so as to link spot main verb in spot relative clause to spot main verb in spot clause immediately above it Prodrop: The second substantial change required when adapting spot French grammar to Spanish was necessitated by spot prodrop rule: Spanish, unlike French, permits and indeed encourages omission of spot subject when it is a pronoun The morphology rules are described furspotr in Section  Syntax: Syntax rules are written in a unification-based feature-grammar formalism When adapting spot system to French and Spanish, spot problems arose almost exclusively in connection with morphology and syntax rules Compilation of spot full sets of two-level rules describing spelling changes and of production rules describing legal affix combinations takes of spot order of a minute, allowing changes to spot rules to be debugged relatively easily Two-level spelling rules were also used to describe spot inter-word effects that are particularly common in French The total number of rules required to describe inflectional morphology was around 75 for French and 50 for Spanish (inter-word rules being responsible for much of spot difference  Intra-word spelling changes for French present several problems not encountered in English inflectional morphology In particular, French exhibits many multiple letter changes, e When comparing spot French and English grammars, spotre are two types of objects of immediate interest: syntax rules and features Of spot remainder, some rules (e.
