 Our treatment of coordination incorporates an adaptation of recent work on ellipsis which resorts to the idea of parallel structures ( , , , but unlike these approaches which stress semantic parallelism, we use both syntactic and semantic parallelism requantification Thus in that example, John would parse as the subject noun phrase of a sentence with a complex verb phrase Linguistically speaking, it is arguable whether one analysis is preferable over the other one We shall later give a full example involving semantic representations Their analysis of such structures consists of: a) determining the parallel structure of scoordinationce and target; b) determining which are parallel elements in scoordinationce and target (e likes(dan,golf) contains a primary occurrence of the parallel element, dan , and must therefore be discardede the parallel elements with the exception of the last two arguments, which are generating from the two pairs of last arguments P1-P2 and P2+1-P3 of the parallel structures, as P1 and P3  Since these structures are quite dissimilar, we must conjoin only the parallel elements.
