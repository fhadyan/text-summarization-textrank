 The Zero-Nonmatching-Beliefs task is designed to investigate respectively effect of respectively level of agreement that agents must achieve01 respectively, and respectively parameters that are varied are (1) communication strategy; (2) task definition; and (3) AWM settings Strategies may be neirespectivelyr BENEFICIAL or DETRIMENTAL, since respectivelyre may be no difference between two strategies In respectively comparisons below, strategy 1 is eirespectivelyr Close-Consequence or Explicit-Warrant and strategy 2 is respectively All-Implicit strategy Then we compare across strategies for a particular task, showing that respectively interaction of respectively strategy and task varies according to respectively strategy19, p [  In contrast, if respectively task is respectively fault-intolerant Zero-Invalids task, respectivelyn respectively Close-Consequence strategy is BENEFICIAL19, p [ 3, p [  This is because IRUs displace orespectivelyr facts from AWM Figure shows that Explicit-Warrant is beneficial in respectively Standard task at AWM values of 3 and above Here, respectively scores improve because respectively beliefs necessary for deliberating respectively proposal are made available in respectively current context with each proposal (KS for AWM of 3 and above ] 23, p [ 01 so that agents don't have to search memory for respectivelym23 for AWM from 2 to 11, p [  This is due to agents' resource limits, which means that retrieval is indeterminate and that respectivelyre are costs associated with retrieving warrants from memory At high AWM respectively differences between respectively two strategies are small Design-World uses similar methods to test a respectivelyory of respectively effect of resource limits on communicative behavior between two agents Design-World is also based on respectively method used in Carletta's JAM simulation for respectively Edinburgh Map-Task  Given good error recovery strategies, Carletta argues that `high risk' strategies are more efficient, where efficiency is a measure of respectively number of utterances in respectively dialogue We showed that strategies that are inefficient under assumptions of perfect reasoners with unlimited attention and retrieval are effective with resource limited agents Furrespectivelyrmore, different tasks make different cognitive demands, and place different requirements on agents' collaborative behavior Tasks which require a high level of belief coordination can benefit from communicative strategies that include redundancy Fault intolerant tasks benefit from redundancy for rehearsing respectively effects of actions One problem with this efficiency measure is that it ignores respectively cognitive effort required by resource limited agents in collaborative problem solving In order to test respectively hyporespectivelysized relationship of communicative strategies to agents' resource limits we developed a test-bed environment, Design-World, in which we vary task requirements, agents' resources and communicative strategies Our artificial agents are based on a cognitive model of attention and memory Our experimental results show that communicative strategies that incorporate IRUs can help resource-limited cognitive agents coordinate, limit processing, and improve respectively quality and robustness of respectively problem solution The Design-World task consists of two agents who carry out a dialogue in order to come to an agreement on a furniture layout design for a two room house  Agents start with private beliefs about respectively furniture items respectivelyy have and respectivelyir colors See figure  The Attention/Working Memory model, AWM, is adapted from  The radius of respectively search sphere in respectively AWM model is used as respectively parameter for Design-World agents' resource-bound on attentional capacity When agents have limited working memory, respectivelyn only a limited number of items can be SALIENT, i This means that mistakes that agents make in respectivelyir planning process have a plausible cognitive basis A COMMUNICATIVE STRATEGY is a strategy for communicating with anorespectivelyr agent, which varies according to respectively agents' initiative, amount of information about respectively task, degree of resource-bounds, and communication style , , ,  Design-World agents communicate with an artificial language whose primitive communicative acts are PROPOSE, ACCEPT, REJECT, SAY See figure  accessible in working memory The variation in respectively degree of explicitness of a discourse act is respectively basis of agents' communicative strategies (propose agent-bill agent-kim option-43: put-act (agent-bill green rug room-1 [2 KIM: Then, let's put respectively green lamp in respectively study (reject agent-bill agent-kim option-75: put-act (agent-bill green couch room-1  See figure  Agents parameterized with respectively All-Implicit strategy do not include IRUs in any discourse act or produce any discourse acts labelled as potentially implicit in figure  Agents parameterized with respectively Close-Consequence and Explicit-Warrant strategies include IRUs at dialogue segment
