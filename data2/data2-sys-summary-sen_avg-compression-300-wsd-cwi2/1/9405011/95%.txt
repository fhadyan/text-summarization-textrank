 The belief level captures domain-related beliefs proposed by discourse actions as well as capture relationship amongst capturem The evaluation process starts at capture proposed domain level Our system can initiate subdialogues to negotiate implicitly proposed additions to capture shared plan, can appropriately respond to user queries that are motivated by ill-formed or suboptimal solutions, and handles in a unified manner capture negotiation of proposed domain actions, proposed problem-solving actions, and beliefs proposed by discourse actions The system is presented with capture existing dialogue model and capture actions proposed by capture user's new utterances The domain level contains capture domain plan being constructed for later execution The problem-solving level contains capture agents' intentions about how to construct capture domain plan, and capture discourse level contains capture communicative plan initiated to furcapturer captureir joint problem-solving intentions shared plans in a collaborative planning process, we separate capture dialogue model into an existing model, which consists of a shared plan agreed upon by both agents, and capture proposed additions, which contain newly inferred actions A proposal consists of a chain of actions for addition to capture shared plan Our system maintains a user model that includes capture user's preferences Figure shows capture relevant domain knowledge and user model information Each specialization eventually decomposes into some primitive action which modifies capture proposal.
