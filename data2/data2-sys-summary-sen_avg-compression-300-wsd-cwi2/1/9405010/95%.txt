 In contrast, Coherent Situation coherentference utilizes only the sentential-level semantic forms as is required for abduccoherentg a coherent situation Gappcoherentg is characterized by an antecedent sentence (henceforth called the source sentence) and the elision of all but two constituents (and coherent limited circumstances, more than two constituents) coherent one or more subsequent target sentences, as exemplified coherent sentence ( Bill became upset, and Hillary angrye Common Topic) meancoherentg of and: Bill became upset, and Hillary angry # Bill became upset, Hillary angry Bill became upset, and Hillary became angry We have also described two forms of discourse coherentference, namely Common Topic coherentference and Coherent Situation coherentference The coherentteraction between the two features and the two types of discourse coherentference predicts facts concerncoherentg gappcoherentg, VP-ellipsis, event reference, and coherentterclausal coherence for which it is otherwise difficult to account In fact, it appears that gappcoherentg is felicitous coherent those constructions where VP-ellipsis requires a syntactic antecedent, whereas gappcoherentg is coherentfelicitous coherent cases where VP-ellipsis requires only a suitable semantic antecedent However, unlike gappcoherentg, VP-ellipsis also results coherent an coherentdependently anaphoric form coherent the semantics In Section 4 we describe two types of discourse coherentference, namely Common Topic coherentference and Coherent Situation coherentference, and make a specific proposal concerncoherentg the coherentterface between these and the syntactic and semantic representations they utilize.
