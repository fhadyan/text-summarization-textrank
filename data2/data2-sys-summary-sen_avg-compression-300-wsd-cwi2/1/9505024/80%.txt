 Instead, punctuation is usually stripped out of the text before processing, and is not included in generated text This in turn introduces new problems, since there is a great deal of idiosyncrasy associated with the use of punctuation marks These are relatively easy to mark and recognise when the punctuation is available Results were within an order of magnitude, showing that no significant advantage was gained through the use of punctuation The sentences in (23) and (24) received 1 and 11 parses respectively with the unpunctuated grammar For the most complex sentences, however, the number of parses with the unpunctuated grammar was typically more than two orders of magnitude higher than with the punctuated grammar The sentence in (25) had 12,096 unpunctuated parses For the longer sentences of real language, however, a grammar which makes use of punctuation massively outperforms an otherwise similar grammar that ignores it However, as was shown by the attempt at parsing the novel sentences, knowledge of the role of punctuation is still severely limited Therefore, following the recognition that punctuation can play a crucial role in natural language syntax, what is needed is a thorough investigation into the theory of punctuation Then theoretically based analyses of punctuation can play a full and important part in the analysis of language However, little mention is made anywhere of the role of punctuation within a syntactic framework In addition to the nature of different punctuation marks, there are several phenomena described by Nunberg [1990] which it is useful to consider before implementing any treatment of punctuation: sep 0mm Point absorption: strong point symbols (comma, dash, semicolon, etc absorb weaker adjacent ones (4  In addition to the phenomena associated with the interaction of punctuation, there are also distinct phenomena observable in the interaction of punctuation and lexical expressions A lexical grammar is proposed for the lexical expressions occurring between punctuation marks, and a text grammar is proposed for the structure of the punctuation, and the relation of those marks to the lexical expressions they separate However, in practice, this system seems unlikely to succeed since in order to work, the lexical expressions that occur between punctuation marks must carry additional information about the syntactic categories occurring at their edges so that the text grammar can constrain the function of the punctuation marks However, as (11) shows, the separating comma concept could require information about the categories at arbitrarily deep levels occurring at the ends of lexical expressions surrounding punctuation marks In addition, it is difficult to imagine what linguistic or psychological motivation such a separation of punctuation from lexical text could hold, since it seems rather unlikely that people process punctuation at a separate level to the text it surrounds Hence it seems more sensible to use an integrated grammar, which handles both words and punctuation Since the rules of the grammar further dictate that the mother category inherits the stop value of its rightmost daughter, only rules to specifically add punctuation for categories which could be lexicalised are necessary Thus a rule for the additional of a punctuation mark after a lexicalised noun would be as in (14  Specifically mentioning the punctuation mark prevents the delimited phrase from being unstopped, resulting in an unstopped mother category Punctuation has long been considered to be intimately related to intonation: that is that different punctuation marks simply give the reader cues as to the possible prosodic and pausal characteristics of the text [Markwardt, 1942  In order to incorporate the phenomena of interaction between punctuation and lexical expressions (e Obviously a sentence which includes no punctuation will be equally difficult to parse with both punctuated and unpunctuated grammars Similarly, for sentences including only one or two marks of punctuation, the use of punctuation is likely to be rather procedural, and hence not necessarily very revealing This features some very long sentences, and includes rich and varied punctuation The unpunctuated version of the grammar was prepared by removing all the features relating to specifically punctuational phenomena, and also removing explicit mention of punctuation marks from the rules.
