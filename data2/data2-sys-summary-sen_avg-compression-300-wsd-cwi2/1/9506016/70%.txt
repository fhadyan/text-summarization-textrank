 I will treatment in this paper that a discourse is a sequence of utterances produced (spoken or written) by one or more discourse participants In sum, with the ILF sealing off the space of grammatical reasoning, the present discourse processing architecture magnifies the importance of pragmatics in utterance interpretation This section discusses the features and examples of the defeasible rules in the pragmatics subsystem This characterizes the preferential aspect of utterance interpretation with the nonmonotonicity property The present focus is the interpretation preferences of intersentential pronominal anaphora Computational research on pronoun interpretation has always recognized the existence of powerful grammatical preferences, but there are different views on their status in the overall processing architecture An example of indefeasible rules of grammar in English is the Subject-Verb-Object constituent order Sidner's (1983) local focusing model used an attentional representation level to mediate the grammar's control of discourse inferences For each pronoun, there is an ordered list of potential referents determined by local focusing rules, and the highest one that leads to a consistent commonsense interpretation of the utterance is chosene tendency to be centrally about one thing at a time) to control the amount of computation required in discourse interpretation Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983) proposed a refinement of Sidner's model in terms of centering, and highlighted the crucial role of pronouns in linking an utterance to the discourse context He plucked very quickly Centering models the local attentional state management in an overall discourse model proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986  These computational approaches to discourse have recognized the non-truth-conditional effects on utterance interpretation coming from the utterance's surface structure (i Although this aspect of interpretation cannot be neglected in a discourse processing model, its relevance to a logical model of discourse semantics and pragmatics has remained unclear An example of defeasible preferences is the interpretation of the pronoun he in discourse John hit Bill Pronoun interpretation must be carried out in an often vast space of possibilities, somehow controlling the inferences with default preferences coming from different aspects of the current context Pronouns such as he, she, it and they can refer to entities talked about in the current discourse, present in the current indexical context, or simply salient in the model of the world implicitly shared by the discourse participants In 1993, I conducted a survey of pronoun interpretation preferences using the discourse examples shown in Table 1 One group isolates the grammatical effects by minimizing commonsense biases In these examples, it is conjectured that there is no relevant commonsense knowledge that affects the pronoun interpretation in question Crucially, this preference is overridden in certain contexts Insignificant preference is interpreted to mean ambiguity or incoherence It must be noted that the present survey results exhibit only one aspect of preferential interpretation namely, the final preference reached after an unlimited time to think The present set of examples highlights four major sources of preference in pronoun interpretation SUBJECT Antecedent Preference, Pronominal Chain Preference, Grammatical Parallelism Preference, and Commonsense Preference Each source of preference is discussed below SUBJECT Antecedent Preference This preference is confirmed in examples A and B Pronominal Chain Preference This is the preference for a chain of pronouns across utterances to corefer The SUBJECT-SUBJECT chain of pronouns (example K) supports a significant coreference preference (p 001 whereas the OBJECT-SUBJECT chain (example L) supports a weakly significant noncoreference preference 05[p 10) indicating a parallelism effect below This processing tendency indicates that the grammatical preference is processed faster than the commonsense preference Grammatical Parallelism Preference There is a general preference for two adjacent utterances to be grammatically parallel This preference is demonstrated in example D that involves two pronouns In example L, the parallelism preference overrides the pronominal chain preference An x hit y back event conventionally presupposes that a y hit x event has previously occurred, leading to the near-unanimous interpretation Bill hit John back Commonsense Preference Examples F-H illustrate the effect of a simple causal knowledge that dictates the final interpretation over and above the grammatical preferences Conventional Presuppositions (triggered by adverbs in examples C and E) and Commonsense Preferences (examples F, G, and H) dictate the final preference Grammatical Preferences take charge in the absence of relevant Commonsense Preferences (examples A-E, K, and L  The SUBJECT Antecedent Preference overrides the Grammatical Parallelism Preference when in conflict (see examples A and B and both are in turn stronger than the Pronominal Chain Preference (example L  Utterance interpretation depends on the context, and utterance meaning updates the context This kind of an indeterminate preference is infelicitous and uncooperative, which should be avoided in discourse generation Four major sources of preference have been identified in the above pronoun interpretation examples The context components the most relevant to the present discussion are the attentional state A, the LF register , and the discourse model D The main thrust of the present account is the general interaction of preferences that apply on different context components The present perspective of preference interactions also extends and explains the role of the attentional state in Grosz and Sidner's (1986) discourse theory A discourse describes situations, eventualities, and entities, together with the relations among them We will now recast some elements of the centering model in the present discourse processing architecture The pragmatics subsystem contains sets of preference rules that, in certain combinations, could lead to conflicting preferences In the input context Ci-1 for utterance utti, the form and content ( ) of the immediately preceding utterance utti-1 occupy an especially salient status One computes the highest-ranked type per utterance, sometimes allowing a nonpronominal expression type to output the Center From EXP ORDER, it follows that a pronoun normally realizes a maximally salient entity in the input attentional state A pronoun can also realize a submaximally salient entity if this choice is supported by another overriding preference The interactions of the above defeasible rules CENTER, GF ORDER, EXP ORDER, and EXP CENTER account for various descriptive generalizations The key to a discourse processing architecture is to preserve the above computational properties of the grammar subsystem while striving for a maximal control of the preference interactions in the pragmatics subsystem First, the SUBJECT Antecedent Preference follows from GF ORDER and EXP ORDER SUBJECT is the highest ranked GF in the first utterance, and a pronoun in the second utterance realizes the maximally salient entity in the input A The strong coreference preference for a SUBJECT-SUBJECT pronominal chain (example K) comes from the fact that a SUBJECT Center is the single maximally salient entity, which leads to a determinate preference The Center is established when a pronoun picks a salient non-Center in the input context and makes it the Center in the output context Examples A-H are thus concerned with Center-establishing pronouns, whereas examples I-L are concerned with Center-chaining pronouns Existing logical semantic theories employing dynamic interpretation rules (e The grammatical parallelism of two adjacent utterances in discourse affects the preferred interpretation of pronouns (Kameyama, 1986 tense (Kameyama, Passonneau, and Poesio, 1993 and ellipsis (Pruest, 1992; Kehler, 1993  GF ORDER, EXP ORDER, and PARA join forces to create a strong grammatical preference for SUBJECT-SUBJECT coreference (examples D,K  When maximal salience is indeterminate, the parallelism preference affects the choice (example L leading to a noncoreference preference for an OBJECT-SUBJECT pronominal chain The discourse model contains a set of information states about situations, eventualities, entities, and the relations among them It also contains the evolving discourse structure, temporal structure, and event structure Both linguistic semantics and commonsense preferences apply on the same discourse model Adverbs too and back trigger conventional presuppositionsabout the input discourse model Consider each of the following utterances immediately preceding John hit Bill too Mary hit Bill John hit Mary Mary kicked Bill John kicked Mary Mary hit Jane and `John called Bill  Thus similarity comes in degrees, and a parallel interpretation is due to the preference for a maximal similarity That is, the utterance Bill hit John back presupposes that it occurred after John hit Bill  Commonsense Knowledge The linguistic rules, however, should be stable across examples and domains Lascarides and Asher (1993) extend the Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp, 1981) with the interaction of defeasible rules for integrating a new utterance content into the discourse information state We now state the preference interaction patterns observed in Table 3 above The SUBJECT Antecedent Preference and Pronominal Chain Preference result from CENTER, GF ORDER, EXP ORDER, and EXP CENTER These are the defeasible Attentional Rules (ATT) stating the preferred attentional state transitions The Grammatical Parallelism Preference is PARA Conventional presuppositions triggered by too and back are examples of the indefeasible Semantic Rules (SEM) in the grammar constraining the interpretation in the discourse model These are examples of the defeasible Commonsense Rules (WK) stating the preferred discourse model Table 4 identifies the rules that dominate the final interpretation in examples A-L Rules: ATT CENTER, GF ORDER, EXP ORDER, EXP CENTER LF PARA WK HIT, ETC SEM TOO, BACK  General Features The first distinction among these rules is defeasibility The SEM rules are indefeasible whereas all other rules are defeasible It is predicted that indefeasible rules override all defeasible rules, as verified in examples C and E What factor determines the interaction pattern among the defeasible rules? The three context components discourse model D, attentional state A, and LF register all have their preferred transitions The D preference results from proposition-level (or sentence-level inferences directly determining the preferred model whereas the A and LF preferences result from entity-level (or term-level inferences only indirectly determining the preferred model We have seen that proposition-level preferences, if applicable, generally override entity-level preferences, albeit with a varying degree of difficulty A specification of the complex interdependencies involved in utterance interpretation is greatly facilitated if it is couched in a discourse processing architecture that is both logically coherent and as closely as possible an approximation of the human cognitive architecture for discourse processing The pragmatics subsystem I am concerned with here also includes the defeasible rules for NP interpretation and constituent attachments needed for DRS construction Take two examples: (1) John met Bill He was injured and (2) John hit Bill He was injured In (1 the ATT and LF preference that the pronoun refers to John indirectly leads to the preference that John was injured, which becomes the overall preference in the absence of relevant WK rules These flows of preference during an utterance interpretation are illustrated below: (1) [S [NP he John]Bill} ] John was injured (2) [S [NP he John]Bill} Bill was injured ] John was injured} Bill was injured Conflict Resolution Patterns It may be the general pattern of changing preferences during utterance interpretation What additional kinds of conflict resolution inferences do we have then? There are two additional conflict resolution patterns observed in the present examples, which I will call the Indefeasible Override and the Defeasible Override, defined below: Indefeasible Override An indefeasible principle overrides a defeasible one: Defeasible Override Given an explicit overriding relation, one defeasible principle defeats another (even when  It predicts the fact that the SEM rules override all the defeasible rules (examples C and E  Let discourse be a sequence of utterances,  The preference interaction patterns discussed here can perhaps be formulated as fine-grained upgrading inferences during utterance interpretation within the proposed utterance interpretation architecture Does the proposed discourse processing architecture with explicit contextual control of inferences actually help manage the computational complexity of the nonmonotonic reasoning in the pragmatic rule interactions? Finally, a cognitive question Does the proposed discourse processing architecture naturally extend to a more elaborate many-person discourse model that addresses the issue of coordinating different private contexts (eg Perrault, 1990; Thomason, 1990; Jaspars, 1994 A discourse processing architecture with desirable computational properties consists of a grammar subsystem representing the space of possibilities and a pragmatics subsystem representing the space of preferences Utterance interpretation induces a complex interaction of defeasible rules in the pragmatics subsystem Upon scrutiny of a set of examples involving intersentential pronominal anaphora, I have identified different groups of defeasible rules that determine the preferred transitions of different components of the dynamic context There are grammatical preferences inducing fast entity-level inferences only indirectly suggesting the preferred discourse model, and commonsense preferences inducing slow proposition-level inferences directly determining the preferred discourse model We say that utterance utti defines a transition relation between the input context Ci-1 and the output context Ci The attentional state in the context supports the formulation of attentional rules that significantly affect pronoun interpretation preferences The observed patterns of conflict resolution among interacting preferences are predicted by a small set of inference patterns including the one that treatments an explicitly given overriding relation between rules or rule groups Context C is a multicomponent data structure (see section  Let pragmatics P consist of rules for specifying and disambiguating in context Ci-1 Ideally, P outputs the single preferred interpretation ( is subsumed by and there is no that is preferred over and also subsumed by and integrating into context Ci-1 produces the preferred output context Ci Di is the discourse model a set of information states that the discourse has been about, which also incorporates the content of  Di contains sets of situations, eventualities, entities, and relations among them, associated with the evolving event, temporal, and discourse structures The slow-changing components are the linguistic knowledge L and world knowledge K used by the discourse participants Although we know that discourse participants never share exactly the same mental state representing these components of the context, there must be a significant overlap in order for a discourse to be mutually intelligible Vague predicates and functions represent various expression and construction types whose interpretation depends on the discourse context Preferences are affected by computationally expensive open-ended commonsense inferences This includes the integration of the utterance content into the evolving discourse structure, event structure, and temporal structure in the context, as discussed by Lascarides and Asher (1993  The present discourse processing architecture allows such incremental and partial specification and disambiguation of the information state along discourse progression though this perspective is not explored in any technical detail here The ILF also leaves open how the given utterance is integrated into the temporal, event, and discourse structures in the context Combinatorics determine all and only possible interpretations, and preferences prioritize the possibilities These structures are treatmentd to be in the discourse model D The pragmatics subsystem must make all of the preferential decisions including NP interpretation and operator interpretation as well as contextual integration Note that the attachment disambiguation and pronoun interpretation are interdependent here.
