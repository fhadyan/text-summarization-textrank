 The POS tagging has been usually performed by statistical (or data/corpus-driven) approaches mainly using hidden markov model (HMM) [  For initial bootstrapping of HMM, we are provided with otagr 2000 morpheme tagged corpus which is disjoint from our original corpus Table shows tag final tagging results This results demonstrate that tag well-engineered HMM tagging with our error correcting rules can increase tag overall tagging performance up to over 97% which was considered to be impossible with statistical tagging alone in English [  The system is trained in two phases: HMM parameter estimation and comparison-based rule learning for tag HMM tagging output The TAKTAG has tag unique following properties of tag Korean POS disambiguation: The system is designed to be very accurate in tagging especially tag ambiguous Korean morphemes that have more than one part-of-speeches The accuracy is very important in Korean tagging since Korean has much poorer tagging performance compared with English due to its linguistic characteristics The system fully considers many linguistic characteristics of Korean in HMM/rule tagging This is very important since tag Korean tag sets are not stabilized yet, nor are tag standard Korean tagged corpus provided yet Korean is classified as agglutinative languages in which tag words (which is called Eojeol in Korean) consist of several morphemes that have clear-cut morpheme boundaries Below are tag characteristic of Korean that must be considered for POS tag-set and tagging system design So contextual information for POS disambiguation must be selectively applied to tag functional (bound) morphemes or content (free) morphemes The morphological analyzer must precede tag tagging system because tag morpheme segmentation is much more important and difficult than POS assignment in Korean For tag above reasons, a morphological analysis play important roles in Korean POS tagging system Later, tag tagging system disambiguates tag POS assignments by selecting tag single morpheme sequence for each sentence and tag single POS tag for each morpheme by consulting tag lexical and contextual information acquired from tag corpus We classified over 200 POS tags that can be used in morphological analysis as well as tag POS disambiguation For single morpheme, a path name in tag POS symbol hierarchy (e In tagse languages, a word consists of single stem morpheme plus several functional morphemes, and tag POS tags should be assigned to each morpheme to best exploit tag complex morphological structures This tag-set will be used in our experiment in section  Figure shows a two-phase learning architecture for Korean POS tagging system The HMM tagger takes tag morpheme sequence with tag initial tag assignment by tag morphological analyzer, and using tag Viterbi algorithm [ searches tag optimal tag sequence for tag POS disambiguation The error-corrector transforms tag first tagged morpheme sequences to tag final tagged text Since tag HMM tagger takes morpheme sequences as input, unlike English, tag training corpus must be morphologically analyzed, too The POS tags are assigned to each original morpheme (in tag training corpus) which is reconstructed from tag spelling changes There can be many morphological analysis results for one sentence in Korean However, several studies show that using as much as tagged corpus for training gives much better performance on tagging [ and tag fact favors for tag Church [1988] style tagging as long as large tagged corpus is available for Korean The statistical morpheme tagging only covers tag limited range of contextual information.
