 Ellipsis interpretations are represented as simple sets of substitutions on semantic representations of the antecedent For the QLF to be interpretable, it is necessary to give the antecedent book term wide scope over the interpretation in order to discharge the index The first reading involves scoping the book quantifier before interpretation resolution The modification is to allow (strict) substitutions on terms not explicitly appearing in the interpretation antecedent i the implicit his paper in the second interpretation when resolving the third interpretation Multiple VP Ellipsis Multiple VP interpretation poses problems at the level of determining which VP is the antecedent of which interpretation Other Forms of Ellipsis: Other forms of interpretation, besides VP-interpretation can be handled substitutionally Any uninstantiated meta-variables in the antecedent are thus re-entrant in the interpretation Whichever scoping is given to the antecedent, a parallel scoping should be given to the interpretation This increases the computational complexity of the interpretation resolution task gives `every house' wide scope over both antecedent and interpretation In this case the two terms, in interpretation and antecedent are both discharged (i We replace both the term and its index by the corresponding term and index from the interpretation In this way, the version of the term occurring in the interpretation is directly linked to antecedent term.
