 Dalrymple, Shieber and Pereira DalShiPer:henceforward (henceforth, DSP) give an equational treatment of ellipsis via higher-order unification which, amongst other things, provides an insightful analysis of the interactions between ellipsis and quantification Ellipsis interpretations are represented as simple sets of substitutions on semantic representations of the antecedent The pronominal term occurs in the restriction of the book term  The ellipsis can be represented as which is conjoined with the antecedent (b) Strict substitution for the book leaves behind an occurrence of the index in the ellipsis For the QLF to be interpretable, it is necessary to give the antecedent book term wide scope over the ellipsis in order to discharge the index As above, the antecedent pronoun is constrained to be given wide scope over the ellipsis, on pain of the index h being undischargeable (Pronouns, like proper names, are treated as contextually restricted quantifiers, where the contextual restriction may limit the domain of quantification to one individual The index substitution from the primary term re-indexes the contextual restriction of the pronoun The first reading involves scoping the book quantifier before ellipsis resolution In DSP's representation of the antecedent of book, both NPs `John' and `he' give rise to two occurrences of the same term (a constant, j  The coverage is basically the same as DSP's: Antecedent Contained Deletion: A sloppy substitution for every person that Simon did in the sentence John greeted every person that Simon did results in re-introducing the ellipsis in its own resolution The modification is to allow (strict) substitutions on terms not explicitly appearing in the ellipsis antecedent i the implicit his paper in the second ellipsis when resolving the third ellipsis Multiple VP Ellipsis Multiple VP ellipsis poses problems at the level of determining which VP is the antecedent of which ellipsis Other Forms of Ellipsis: Other forms of ellipsis, besides VP-ellipsis can be handled substitutionally Who slept? John is straightforwardly accommodated agent(e john  In VP ellipsis, strict identity corresponds to copying the entire role assignment from the antecedent Selecting ellipsis antecedents and parallel elements within them is an open problem , , ,  In the ellipsis is contained within a form expression whose category is This states the syntactic tense, aspect and polarity marked on the ellipsis (underscores indicate lack of specification  The category also says that, for this kind of VP match, the term in the antecedent whose category identifies it as being the subject should be treated as parallel to the explicit term in the ellipsis As this example illustrates, tense and aspect on ellipsis and antecedent do not have to agree When this is so, the antecedent and ellipsis categories are both used to determine what should be substituted for the antecedent  This comprises the restriction of the antecedent and a new category constructed by taking the features of the antecedent category, unless overridden by those on the ellipsis a kind of (monotonic) priority union except using skeptical as opposed to credulous default unification  co-referential vs co-indexed terms  This is reflected in the order-sensitive interleaving of scope and ellipsis resolution in DSP's account Section describes the substitutional treatment of ellipsis by way of a few examples presented in a simplified version of Quasi Logical Form (QLF) ,  Section raises some open questions concerning the determination of parallelism between ellipsis and antecedent, and other issues This section illustrates the substitutional treatment of ellipsis through a small number of examples Prior to reference resolution, the contextual restriction on the term would be an uninstantiated meta-variable; resolution consists of instantiating meta-variables to contextually appropriate values The scope of the term is indicated by the scope node prefixing the formula  Again, prior to resolution this scope node would be an uninstantiated meta-variable To resolve the ellipsis, it needs to be instantiated to some contextually salient predicate Along similar lines to DSP, we can set up an equation to determine possible values for ?P: That is, we are looking for a predicate that when applied to the subject term of the ellipsis antecedent returns the antecedent The interpretation of the ellipsis is then given by applying this predicate to the subject of the ellipsis The substitutions are represented using the notation ` The meaning of an ellipsis is composed in essentially the same way, and from the same components, as the meaning of its antecedent In the example discussed above, the meaning of the ellipsis is built up in the same way as for the antecedent, except that whenever you encounter a term corresponding to `John' or something dependent/co-indexed with it, you it is treated as though it were the term for `Mary' or dependent/co-indexed with it The reason that substitutions are not `applied' immediately upon ellipsis resolution is as follows At the time of deciding on the ellipsis substitutions, the precise composition of the antecedent may not yet have been determined (For instance the scopes of quantifiers or the contextual restrictions on pronouns in the antecedent may not have been resolved; this will correspond to the presence of uninstantiated meta-variables in the antecedent QLF The ellipsis should follow, modulo the substitutions, the same composition as the antecedent, whatever that composition is eventually determined to be The elliptical QLF will contain a predicate formed from the antecedent QLF plus substitutions Any uninstantiated meta-variables in the antecedent are thus re-entrant in the ellipsis Consequently, any further resolutions to the antecedent are automatically imposed on the ellipsis It was noted above that substitutions on term indices in scope nodes ensures scope parallelism Whichever scoping is given to the antecedent, a parallel scoping should be given to the ellipsis This increases the computational complexity of the ellipsis resolution task Whichever resolution is made, the substitution of for ensures parallel scoping in the ellipsis for `an American flag  gives `every house' wide scope over both antecedent and ellipsis In this case the two terms, in ellipsis and antecedent are both discharged (i This paper presents a treatment of ellipsis which avoids these difficulties, while having essentially the same coverage as DSP The sentence has three readings: John and Simon read the same book; John and Simon both read a book belonging to John, though not necessarily the same one; John reads one of John's books and Simon reads one of Simon's books Intuitively, the first reading arises from strictly identifying the elliptical book with the antecedent book We need to distinguish between parallel and non-parallel terms in ellipsis antecedents The treatment is easily implementable, and forms the basis of the ellipsis resolution component currently used within the Core Language Engine  Parallel terms, like John in the example above, are those that correspond terms appearing explicitly in the ellipsis Non-parallel terms are those that do not have an explicit parallel in the ellipsis (Determining which terms are parallel/non-parallel is touched on in section For parallel terms, we have no choice about the ellipsis substitution We replace both the term and its index by the corresponding term and index from the ellipsis A sloppy substitution involves substituting a new term index for the old one This has the effect of reindexing the version of the term occurring in the ellipsis, so that it refers to the same kind of thing as the antecedent term but is not otherwise linked to it A strict substitution substitutes the term by its index In this way, the version of the term occurring in the ellipsis is directly linked to antecedent term To illustrate, an abbreviated QLF for the antecedent John read a book he owned is Here, we have left the scope node as an uninstantiated meta-variable ?S.
