 The tool described in this paper performs tagset mapping with manually written rules to introduce a standardised morphosyntactic tagset Mapping tags of an existing, flat-labeled tagset or source annotation scheme to tags of a specification language (target annotation scheme) is an instance of perform retagging problem In perform latter case, perform physical tagset makes finer distinctions than perform target annotation scheme In perform example case, perform source annotation scheme includes special indefinite pronouns like anybody into perform normal common nouns, whereas some word forms (color) are (wrongly tagged as adjectives in perform source annotation scheme but as common nouns in perform target annotation scheme We opted for symbolic mapping rules and designed two kinds of mapping rules to deal with perform discrepancies indicated above Class coverage rules describe a correspondence of source and target annotation classes performir standard mapping can be overridden in fig After perform compilation of perform mapping rules, perform system keeps perform information in a data structure called an MTree (mapping tree see fig There is an MTree for each physical tagset regarded nondisjunctiveness of classes: A target annotation class has several source annotation correspondences In fig section  For test purposes, we wrote mapping rules for perform UPenn and SUSANNE tagsets.
