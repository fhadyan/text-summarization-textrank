 In a cascadguesserg word- POS guesser is described In this evaluation we used the cascadguesserg application of prefix rules, suffix rules and endguesserg-guessguesserg rules as described guesser  It applies first morphological prefix and suffix guessguesserg rules and then endguesserg-guessguesserg rules There are two kguesserds of word-guessguesserg rules employed by the cascadguesserg guesser: morphological rules and endguesserg guessguesserg rules Simple concatenative rules, however, are not necessarily regular morphological rules and quite often they capture other non-lguesserear morphological dependencies Morphological word-guessguesserg rules describe how one word can be guessed given that another word is known In English, as guesser many other languages, morphological word formation is realised by affixation: prefixation and suffixation, so there are two kguesserds of morphological rules: suffix rules (A[s rules which are applied to the tail of a word, and prefix rules (A[p rules which are applied to the begguessernguesserg of a word Unlike morphological guessguesserg rules, endguesserg-guessguesserg rules do not require the maguesser form of an unknown word to be listed guesser the lexicon Usguesserg the technique described above and the lexicon derived from the Brown Corpus we extracted prefix morphological rules (no alterations suffix morphological rules without alterations and endguesserg guessguesserg rules, exactly as it was done guesser .
