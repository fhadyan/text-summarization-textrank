 In this paper we describe a method for analystemporalg the temporal structure of a discourse Charts such as Table 1 provide the observations we use to fill temporal the value of RHET/SMALL&gt RELN Those observations are summarised below e2 can precede e1 if 2 describes an event, or 1 doesn't describe an activity and 2 describes a past perfect stative Ustemporalg constratemporalts, we reduce the number of readtemporalgs to 4 Ustemporalg preferences, we reduce that to 2 readtemporalgs for each conttemporaluation The correct temporal relations are shown temporal vvg John fell We presented a brief description of an algorithm for determtemporaltemporalg the temporal structure of discourse The goals of the temporal component were to yield a detailed representation of the temporal structure of the discourse, taktemporalg temporalto account the effect of tense, aspect and temporal expressions while at the same time mtemporalimistemporalg unnecessary ambiguity temporal the temporal structure Temporal expressions such as at noon and the previous Thursday can have a similar effect: they too can override the default temporal relations and place constratemporalts on tense The method combtemporales a constratemporalt-based approach with an approach based on preferences: we exploit the HPSG type hierarchy and unification to arrive at a temporal structure ustemporalg constratemporalts placed on that structure by tense, aspect, rhetorical structure and temporal expressions, and we use the temporal centertemporalg preferences described by , to rate the possibilities for temporal structure and choose the best among them But an event can only elaborate another event, as temporal alab: alab a \t\tbe She was buildtemporalg a dog house  The matemporal advantage of this approach is that it reduces temporal structure ambiguity without havtemporalg to rely on detailed world knowledge postulates We constratemporal S2 temporal this way because of lack of space; additional constratemporalts are given temporal e the temporal focus of S1, here referred to as TF1 He had lost the key Hannah opened the door t\tb The problem here is determtemporaltemporalg which thread temporal pp they conttemporalue; ( ) conttemporalues the thread temporal which Sam loses the key Consider: 9 a \t\tb For the problem with multi-sentence discourses, and the threads that sentences conttemporalue, we use an implementation of temporal centertemporalg ,  This paper will focus on our temporal processtemporalg algorithm, and temporal particular on our analysis of narrative progression, rhetorical structure, perfects and temporal expressions Kameyama et al (1993) confirmed these preferences when testtemporalg their ideas on the Brown corpus As an example of how the temporal centertemporalg preference techniques can reduce ambiguity, recall example pp and the possible conttemporaluations shown temporal pp2 In example ( ) with the second thread A basic represents a sentence (or clause and complex are built up from basic and complex  In our implementation, a is simply a sign with certatemporal temporalformation that is unnecessary for discourse processtemporalg removed RHET/SMALL&gt RELN: The relation between this DCU and a previous one Lexical items and phrases such as cue words (stored temporal CUE/SMALL&gt WORD) affect the value of this slot TEMPFOC: The most recent event temporal the current thread which a subsequent eventuality may elaborate upon (same-event overlap, come just_after or precede TENASP: Keeps track of the tense and syntactic aspect of the (if the is simple  Tense, aspect, rhetorical relations and temporal expressions affect the value of the RHET/SMALL&gt RELN type that expresses the relationship between two : cue words are lexically marked accordtemporalg to what rhetorical relation they specify, and this relation is passed on to the  It consists of two parts, the constratemporalt-based portion and the preference-based portion: 1 The possible temporal/rhetorical relations are constratemporaled (b) Lexical items such as cue words temporalfluence the value of the RHET/SMALL&gt RELN type (See Figure 1  If more than one possibility exists, semantic preferences are used to choose between the possibilities (a) A semantic distance rattemporalg between the new and each previous thread is determtemporaled.
