 Thus, although somewhat overly harsh, the heuristic is quite effective in identifying bad parses With our integrated heuristic scheme, good/close parses were returned in 30 sentences (6 additional sentences  Information about skipped words is maintained in the symbol nodes that represent parse sub-trees The parser then selects the parse ranked best (i the parse of lowest overall score  The statistical score of the disambiguated parse tree The penalty scheme for skipped words is designed to prefer parses that correspond to fewer skipped words95 - 105) for each word of the original sentence that was skipped Training of the probabilities is performed on a set of disambiguated parses A list of common appearing substitutions was constructed from the development set95 and 1 Our goal was three-fold Second, we wished to test the effectiveness of our evaluation heuristics in selecting the best parse The first run was with skipping disabled The second run was conducted with skipping enabled and full heuristics The third run was conducted with skipping enabled, and with a simple heuristic that prefers parses based only on the number of words skipped The results indicate that using the GLR* parser results in a significant improvement in performance Fully 96% of the test sentences (all but 5) are parsable by GLR .
