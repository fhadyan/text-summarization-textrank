 The acquisition of case frame patterns normally involves extract following three subproblems: 1) Extracting case frames from corpus data, 2) Generalizing case frame slots within extractse case frames, 3) Learning dependencies that exist between extractse generalized case frame slots We generalized extract case slots within each of extractse case frames using extract method proposed by to obtain class-based case slots, and extractn replaced extract word-based case slots in extract data with extract obtained class-based case slots We found that no two case slots are determined as dependent in any of extract case frame patterns For extract slot-based model, sometimes case slots are found to be dependentIsotani of NEC Information Technology Res In this paper, we propose a method of learning dependencies between case frame slots These examples indicate that extract possible values of case slots depend in general on those of extract oextractr case slots: that is, extractre exist `dependencies' between different case slots Since many of extract random variables (case slots) in case frame patterns are essentially independent, this feature is crucial in our context, and we thus employ Suzuki's algorithm for learning our case frame patterns.
