 A SIC is a finite set of elementary node addresses (ENAs  Each node of elementary d-trees has an associated sister-adjunction constraint (SAC  We subsert the resulting structure into the seems clause by substituting its maximal projection node, labelled VP[fin: at the VP[fin: frontier node of seems, and by inserting the subject into the d-edge of the seems tree We first subsert the to adore d-tree into the seems tree as above, by substituting the anchor component at the substitution node of seems The derivation proceeds as follows We first subsert the embedded clause tree into the matrix clause tree When comparing this derivation structure to the dependency structure in Figure , the following problems become apparent Vijay-Shanker points out that use of adjunction for clausal complementation in TAG corresponds, at the level of dependency structure, to substitution at the foot node of the adjoined tree Section briefly discusses DTG recognition algorithms When a d-tree is subserted into another d-tree , a component of is substituted at a frontier nonterminal node (a substitution node) of and all components of that are above the substituted component are inserted into d-edges above the substituted node or placed above the root node In the composed d-tree the component is substituted at a substitution node in .
