 Each node of elementary d-trees has an associated sister-adjunction constraint (SAC  The derivation proceeds as follows We first subsert the embedded clause tree into the matrix clause tree When a d-tree is subserted into another d-tree , a component of is substituted at a frontier nonterminal node (a substitution node) of and all components of that are above the substituted component are inserted into d-edges above the substituted node or placed above the root node In the composed d-tree the component is substituted at a substitution node in .
