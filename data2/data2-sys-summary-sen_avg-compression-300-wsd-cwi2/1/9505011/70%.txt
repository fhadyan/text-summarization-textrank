 Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993) adjective adjectives into partitions and present an interesting evaluation to compare the generated adjective classes against those provided by an expert This method works very well for partitions An ideal scheme used to evaluate semantic classes should be able to handle overlapping classes (as opposed to partitions) as well as hierarchies In the discussion that follows, the word adjectiveing is used to refer to the set of classes that may be either provided by an expert or generated by the system, and the word class is used to refer to a single class in the adjectiveing As mentioned above, we intend to be able to compare a adjectiveing generated by a system against one provided by an expert Since a word can occur in more than one class, it is important to find some kind of mapping between the classes generated by the system and the classes given by the expert For example, suppose that Class A is generated by the system and Class B is provided by an expert (as shown in Table 1  The contingency table obtained for this pair of classes is shown in Table 2e classifying a set of words into several potentially overlapping classes The classes produced by a system are later compared to these correct classifications provided by the expert In order to determine pairwise mappings between the adjectiveing generated by the system and one provided by an expert, a table of F-measures is constructed, with a row for each class generated by the system, and a column for every class provided by the expert Note that since the expert actually provides a hierarchy, there is one column corresponding to every individual class and subclass provided by the expert This allows the system's classes to map to a class at any level in the expert's hierarchy This table gives an estimate of how well each class generated by the system maps to the ones provided by the expert In general, conflicts arise when more than one class generated by the system maps to a given class provided by the expert To resolve a conflict, one of the system classes must be re-mapped Since semantic classes are often domain-specific, their automatic acquisition is not trivial Rather than populating separate contingency tables for every pair of classes, construct a single contingency table Once all the mapped classes have been incorporated into this contingency table, add every element of all unmapped classes generated by the system to the YES-NO cell and every element of all unmapped classes provided by the expert to the NO-YES cell of this table Three experts were used to evaluate the generated noun adjectives The results obtained by comparing these noun classes to the adjectiveings provided by three different experts are shown in Table 3 The evaluation scheme presented here still suffers from one major limitation it is not capable of evaluating a hierarchy generated by a system against one provided by an expert This paper concentrates on the aspect of evaluating the obtained adjectives against classes provided by human experts.
