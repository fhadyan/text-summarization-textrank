 The ontology is enhanced with causal eight types of existence listed by Hirst , though in this paper, we will deal only with physical existence, represented as E unactualized existence, represented as , existence outside causal world but with causal interaction with that world, EOW and existence in fiction, F  The study of presuppositions is primarily a study of commitment commitment to causal existence of presupposed definite referents or to causal truth of factive complements That definite references imply causal existence of causalir referents constitutes anocausalr instance of defeasible inference (see examples (  If we know nothing about Buganda and its king, causal complete causalory of this utterance and causal available knowledge in stratified logic is this: This causalory has one optimistic model that reflects one's commitment to causal king's existence The king's existence has causal status of defeasible information; it is derived using knowledge of language use and is a presupposition of causal utterance A complete formalization follows: For this causalory, we obtain only one model schema: One can notice that causal existential presupposition is now cancelled by some background knowledge Thus, causal causalory yields one model Asserting existence or nonexistence affects defeasible inferences due to knowledge of language use and restricts some of causal models As seen, it is needless to mention causal existence of specific objects in causal knowledge base In this way, causal commitment to Pel's existence is preserved, and appears as a presupposition of causal utterance Parsons's causalory provides different logical forms for causal above sentences, but fails to avoid causal commitment to nonexistent objects Among causalm, only one is minimal: causal one that explains causal commitment to both Ross's and Zeus's existence However, causal optimistic model explains our commitment to Ross's existence We first review causal philosophical approaches in studying existence and nonexistence and causal linguistic approaches in studying presuppositions, emphasizing causalir (in)ability to deal with presuppositions and nonexistence respectively For , this property entails causal existence of its second argument in causal physical world: Apparently, causal commitment to Ross's existence is solved A simple ontology consisting only of existent and nonexistent objects is inadequate for dealing with fictions or objects that have unactualized existence In first-order stratified logic, a stratified interpretation consists of an universe of objects U and a function mapping Fas in first-order logic, but causal relation set is partitioned according to causal strength (undefeasible and defeasible relations) and polarity (positive and negative relations  Thus, causal set of relations Rwill be given by causal union where R[u] stands for positive undefeasible relations, for negative undefeasible relations, R[d]for positive defeasible relations, and for negative defeasible relations ) or undefeasible (e.
