 Today, the problem is quiet different Tagging sentences with the name of their language solves this problem by switching each application in function of the language Grammatical words are proper to each language and are in a whole different from one language to another So, these words can be use as discriminant of language But can we use them as discriminant of sentences? Grammatical words in sentences represent on average about 50% of words Furthermore, relying on grammatical words allows textual errors tolerance and foreign words import from other languages (usual in scientific texts  It's also important to note that foreign words import concerns nouns, verbs, adjectives but never grammatical words These rules will allow us to categorize sentences which have enough grammatical words but in short sentences (less than 10 words there are few grammatical words, and by the way, few clues We can also remark that using grammatical words is different from using most common words The number of words to hold is quiet subjective There are two levels to improve sentences categorization: a level below using words morphology and a level above using text structure Mainly two ways can be explore to improve categorization, using natural languages properties: Syllabation: the idea is to check the good syllabation of words in a language To manage the possible points of change of language via included segments (see section the language classification procedure uses a recursive algorithm to easily handle changes of context We use dictionnaries to get the grammatical words of each language (see table ) and their alphabet They express the fact that a sentence is usually written with grammatical words and that grammatical words are totally discriminant for sentences of more than 8 words Deductions really start between 4 and 6 words Here, sentences and grammatical words appear but in few quantities to allow a perfect deduction Isolating a single language does not mean exactly isolating the right language.
