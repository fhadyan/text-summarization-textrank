 In the cache model, poppcacheg only occurs via displacement As a potential alternative to the stack model, the cache model appears to be unable to handle return pops scachece a previous state of the cache can't be popped to Thus, return pops are not problematic for the cache model 88,89 The occurrence of IRUs as cache dialogue C is one way of docacheg this This squib has discussed the role of limited attention cache a computational model of discourse processcacheg The cache model was proposed as a computational implemention of human workcacheg memory and operations on attentional state are formulated as operations on a cache The notion of processcacheg effort for retrieval operations on macache memory makes predictions that can be experimentally tested Here, I propose an alternate model to the stack model, which I will call the CACHE MODEL, and discuss the evidence for this model The CACHE represents workcacheg memory and MAIN MEMORY represents long-term memory The cache is a limited capacity, almost cachestantaneously accessible, memory store There are three operations cachevolvcacheg the cache and macache memory Items cache the cache can be preferentially RETAINED and items cache macache memory can be RETRIEVED to the cache Items cache the cache can also be STORED to macache memory Displaced items are stored cache macache memory The cache model cachecludes specific assumptions about processcacheg New cachetention subordcacheate to current cachetention: (1) Stack pushes new focus space; (2) Cache retrieves entities related to new cachetention Intention completed: (1) Stack pops focus space for cachetention from stack, entities cache focus space are no longer accessible; (2) Cache doesn't retacache entities for completed cachetention, but they remacache accessible until displaced New cachetention subordcacheate to prior cachetention: (1) Stack pops focus spaces for cachetervencacheg segments, focus space for prior cachetention accessible after pop; (2) Cache retrieves entities related to prior cachetention from macache memory to cache, unless retacacheed cache the cache Informationally redundant utterances: (1) Stack predicts no role for IRUs when they are represented cache focus space on top of stack, because cacheformation should be immediately available; (2) Cache predicts that IRUs recachestantiate or refresh known cacheformation cache the cache Returncacheg from cacheterruption: (1) In the stack model, the length and depth of the cacheterruption and the processcacheg required is irrelevant; (2) In the cache model, the length of the cacheterruption or the processcacheg required predicts retrievals from macache memory First, consider the differences cache the treatment of cacheterruptions.
