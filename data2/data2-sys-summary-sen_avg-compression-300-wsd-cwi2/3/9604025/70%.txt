 Then we measured whether suffix rules with alterations (A) add any improvement if they are used in conjunction with the ending-guessing rules The second part of Table 1 shows that simple concatenative suffix rules (S60) improved the precision of the guessing when they were applied before the ending-guessing rules (E75) by about 5  We gathered about three thousand words from the lexicon developed for the Wall Street Journal corpus and collected frequencies of these words in this corpus This, actually, did not come as a surprise, since many main forms required by the suffix rules were missing in the lexicon In a cascading word- POS guesser is described The task of unknown word guessing is, however, a subtask of the overall part-of-speech tagging process So, we performed an independent evaluation of the impact of the word guessing sets on tagging accuracy In this evaluation we used the cascading application of prefix rules, suffix rules and ending-guessing rules as described in  We measured whether the addition of the suffix rules with alterations increases the accuracy of tagging in comparison with the standard rule-sets In the evaluation of tagging accuracy on unknown words we payed attention to two metrics It applies first morphological prefix and suffix guessing rules and suffix ending-guessing rules This small lexicon contained only 5,456 entries out of 53,015 entries of the original Brown Corpus lexicon This text was detected to have 347 unknown to the Brown Corpus lexicon words and as it can be seen the additional rule-set did not cause any improvement to the tagging accuracy Then we tagged the same text using the small lexicon Out of 5,970 words of the text, 2,215 were unknown to the small lexicon The target of the research reported in this paper was to incorporate the learning of morphological word- POS guessing rules which do not obey simple concatenations of main words with affixes into the learning paradigm proposed in  Thus simple concatenative rules naturally became a subset of the mutative rules - they can be seen as mutative rules with the zero mutation, i There are two kinds of word-guessing rules employed by the cascading guesser: morphological rules and ending guessing rules Simple concatenative rules, however, are not necessarily regular morphological rules and quite often they capture other non-linear morphological dependencies Morphological word-guessing rules describe how one word can be guessed given that another word is known As it was measured in simple concatenative prefix and suffix morphological rules improved the overall precision of the cascading guesser by about 5 which resulted in 2% higher accuracy of tagging on unknown words The additional rule-set of suffix rules with one letter mutation caused some further improvement In English, as in many other languages, morphological word formation is realised by affixation: prefixation and suffixation, so there are two kinds of morphological rules: suffix rules (A[s rules which are applied to the tail of a word, and prefix rules (A[p rules which are applied to the beginning of a word For example, the prefix rule: A[p] : [un (VBD VBN) (JJ says that if segmenting the prefix un from an unknown word results in a word which is found in the lexicon as a past verb and participle (VBD VBN we conclude that the unknown word is an adjective (JJ  An example of a suffix rule is: A[s] : [ed (NN VB) (JJ VBD VBN This rule says that if by stripping the suffix ed from an unknown word we produce a word with the POS-class noun/verb (NN VB the unknown word is of the class adjective/past-verb/participle (JJ VBD VBN  This rule works, for instance, for word pairs [book booked [water watered etc Unlike morphological guessing rules, ending-guessing rules do not require the main form of an unknown word to be listed in the lexicon These rules guess a POS-class for a word just on the basis of its ending characters and without looking up its stem in the lexicon Not surprisingly, morphological guessing rules are more accurate than ending-guessing rules but their lexical coverage is more restricted, i they are able to cover less unknown words This, actually, resulted in about 2% higher accuracy of tagging on unknown words This is where word- POS guessers take their place - they employ the analysis of word features, e So we thought that the incorporation of a set of guessing rules which can capture morphological word dependencies with letter alterations should extend the lexical coverage of the morphological rules and hence might contribute to the overall guessing accuracy The major topic in the development of word- POS guessers is the strategy which is to be used for the acquisition of the guessing rules Brill outlines a transformation-based learner which learns guessing rules from a pre-tagged training corpus word leading and trailing characters to figure out its possible POS categories from an unknown word we strip the affix S, add the mutative segment M, lookup the produced string in the lexicon and if it is of class Iwe conclude that the unknown word is of class R Next, we modified the operator which was used for the extraction of morphological guessing rules The operator will extract the rules with the alterations in the last letter of the main word, as in the example above The operator is applied to a pair of words from the lexicon Then it tries to segment an affix by subtracting the shorter word without the mutative ending from the longer word Thus sets of morphological guessing rules together with their calculated frequencies are produced Next, from these sets of guessing rules we need to cut out infrequent rules which might bias the further learning process For example, if a guessing rule strips a particular suffix and a current word from the corpus does not have such suffix we classify these word and rule as incompatible and the rule as not applicable to that word First, we measure the performance of a guessing rule-set against the actual lexicon: every word from the lexicon, except for closed-class words and words shorter than five characters, is guessed by the rule-sets and the results are compared with the information the word has in the lexicon A similar approach was taken in where an unknown word was guessed given the probabilities for an unknown word to be of a particular POS, its capitalisation feature and its ending In our approach, guessing rules are extracted from the lexicon and the actual corpus frequencies of word-usage suffix allow for discrimination between rules which are no longer productive (but have left their imprint on the basic lexicon) and rules that are productive in real-life texts In a system of rules which uses both ending-guessing and more morphologically motivated rules is described Using the technique described above and the lexicon derived from the Brown Corpus we extracted prefix morphological rules (no alterations suffix morphological rules without alterations and ending guessing rules, exactly as it was done in  Then we extracted suffix morphological rules with alterations in the last letter ( which was a new rule-set for the cascading guesser Quite interestingly apart from the expected suffix rules with alterations as: [ S= ied I= (NN, VB) R= (JJ VBD VBN) M=y] which can handle pairs like deny denied, this rule-set was populated with second-order rules which describe dependencies between secondary forms of words This rule, for instance, is applicable to word pairs: affects affection, asserts assertion, etc The first part of Table 1 shows the best obtained scores for the standard suffix rules (S) and suffix rules with alterations in the last letter (A .
