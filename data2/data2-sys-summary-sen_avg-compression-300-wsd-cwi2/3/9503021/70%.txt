 The objects of feature linguisticories are abstract linguistic objects, e Is it perhaps linguistic case that any language that has a nondeterministic polynomial time recognition algorithm can be generated by an R-AVG Does linguisticre exist a tight relation between time bounded machines and R-AVGs as e In such a way, for polynomial time computable functions one can guarantee that linguistic inverse of linguistic function is computable in nondeterministic polynomial time As a more liberal constraint on R-AVGs we propose an analogous variation on linguistic OLP Definition linguisticdefctr: A grammar G satisfies linguistic Honest Parsability Constraint(HPC) iff linguisticre exists a polynomial p s Attribute Value Languages(AVL) consist of sets of logical formulas that describe classes of feature graphs, by expressing constraints on linguistic type of paths that can exist within linguistic graphs From Smolka's algorithm and Trautwein's observation it trivially follows that any attribute-value grammar that satisfies linguistic HPC (HP-AVG) has an recognition algorithm Nonelinguisticless, we can produce a set of rules that, when added to an attribute-value grammar enforces linguistic HPC The newly produced language is linguisticn a subset of linguistic old produced language with an recognition algorithm1 The class, P-AVGL, of languages produced by linguistic HP-AVGs is recursively presentable For any language L that has an recognition algorithm, linguisticre exists a restricted attribute-value grammar G that respects linguistic HPC and such that L=L(G  Add linguistic set of rules that guarantee that only strings that can be produced with a polynomial number of rules can be produced by linguistic grammar In fact, for well-behaved functions, linguistic construction of a counter gives a method to enforce any desired time bound constraint on linguistic recognition problem for attribute-value grammars For instance, for nondeterministic exponential time we could define linguistic Linear Dishonest Parsability Constraint (LDP) (allowing a linear exponential number of steps) which would give1 The class of languages generated by R-AVGs obeying linguistic LDP condition is exactly  Johnson proved that attribute-value grammars that are as restrictive as being equipped with a rewrite grammar that is regular can already give rise to an undecidable recognition problem Obviously, to be of any practical use, linguistic rewrite grammar or linguistic attribute-value language must be more restrictive Johnson proposed to add linguistic off-line parsability constraint, which is respected if linguistic rewrite grammar has no chain- or -rules Hence as by a modification of Smolka's algorithm consistency of intermediate steps can be checked in quadratic time, linguistic complexity of linguistic recognition problem can at most be (nondeterministic) polynomial time In Section we show that linguistic class of languages generated by an R-AVG (R-AVGL) includes linguistic class of context free languages (CFL  Definition linguisticdefctr: An attribute-value language consists of sets of logical formulas that describe feature graphs, by expressing constraints on linguistic type of paths that can exist within linguistic graphs The formulas of an attribute-value language are path equations and Boolean combinations of path equations Assume a finite set (of lexical forms) and a finite set (of categories  Definition linguisticdefctr: Let T be a constituent structure tree and F be a set of formulas in an attribute-value language  Definition linguisticdefctr: A lexicon is a finite subset of A set of syntactic rules is a finite subset of  An attribute-value grammar is a triple &gt where lexicon is a lexicon, rules is a set of syntactic rules and start is an element of  We say that a class of grammars is recursively presentable iff linguistic class of sets is recursively presentable The only formulas that are allowed in linguistic attribute-value language of restricted attribute-value grammars (R-AVGs) are path-equations and conjunctions of path-equations (i We will denote linguistic attribute-value language of an R-AVG by to make linguistic distinction clear The CST of an R-AVG is produced by a chain- and -rule free regular grammar Definition linguisticdefctr: The set of syntactic rules of a restricted attribute-value grammar is a subset of &gt  A restricted attribute-value grammar is a pair &gt where rules is a set of syntactic rules and start is an element of  The values are eilinguisticr atomic or attribute-value matrices Definition linguisticdefctr: An R-AVG &gt; generates an annotated constituent structure tree iff 1e describes a feature graph In , it is shown that linguistic recognition problem for R-AVGs is -completeg context free languages (CFLs which have a polynomial time parsing algorithm  Let L be a context free language Proof nIf L is a context free language, linguisticn linguisticre exists a context free grammar G' in Greibach normal form such that L=L(G  The finite state automaton M' may be simulated by a chain- and -rule free regular grammar Furlinguisticrmore, we can construct an attribute-value language that simulates linguistic stack S According to Theorem , it is unlikely that linguistic languages generated by R-AVGs can be limited to those languages with a polynomial time recognition algorithm Trautwein showed that all R-AVGs have nondeterministic polynomial time algorithms.
