 Tomabechi, 1991) in systems using lexicalist grammar formalisms (e5 grammar, and Alshawi (personal communication) points out that the CLE parser had not previously been run with a grammar containing such a large number of rules, in contrast to the ANLT parsers Briscoe Carroll (1993) describe a methodology for constructing an LR parser for a unification-based grammar, in which a CF `backbone' grammar is automatically constructed from the unification grammar, a parse table is constructed from the backbone grammar, and a parser is driven by the table and further controlled by unification of the `residue' of features in the unification grammar that are not encoded in the backbone The space complexity is also cubic, since the parser uses Earley's representation of parse forests Parsing uses fixed-arity term unification The ANLT grammar also failed to parse three of these, plus an additional four Table 1 shows the total parse times and storage allocated for the BU-LC parser, the LR parser, and the CE parser, all with ANLT grammar and lexicon5 grammar and lexicon The throughput of the CE parser is half that of the LR parser, and also less than that of the BU-LC parser.
