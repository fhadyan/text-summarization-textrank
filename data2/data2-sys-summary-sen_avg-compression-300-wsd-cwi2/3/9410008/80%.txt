 There are different types of text Texts about the same thing may be in differing genres, of different types, and of varying quality For data we used the Brown corpus of English text samples of uniform length, categorized in several categories as seen in table  We ran discriminant analysis on the texts in the corpus using several different features as seen in table  Texts vary along several parameters, all relevant for the general information retrieval problem of matching reader needs and texts Miscellaneous the most problematic category, is a loose grouping of different informative texts We discuss how well this method categorizes a set text, given a set of categories, and given a set of parameters Certain parameters probably vary more in certain text types than others, and they may have a skewed distribution as well As long as readability indexing schemes are used in descriptive applications they work well to discriminate between text types The technique shows practical promise General text types may be useful, but quite probably genre will be a domain- or field-specific text typology The project at present studies texts which appear on several different types of USENET News conferences, and investigates how well the classification criteria and categories that experienced USENET News users report using (IntFilter, 1993) can be used by a newsreader system The project uses categories such as query comment announcement FAQ and so forth, categorizing them using parameters such as different types of length measures, form word content, quote level, percentage quoted text and other USENET News specific parameters Texts about certain topics may only occur in certain genres, and texts in certain genres may only treat certain topics; most topics do, however, occur in several genres, which is what interests us here Douglas Biber has studied text variation along several parameters, and found that texts can be considered to vary along five dimensions.
