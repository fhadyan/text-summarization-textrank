 Similarly, we can compute the semantic complexity of ELIZA as Q-complexity yes/no and what-is complexities  Namely, what is -complexity and twice-iterated-what-is -complexity measures the size of the database of background knowledge facts Intuitively, this is a reasonable measure of their semantic complexity One of the tools for measuring complexity widely used in theoretical computer science is Kolmogorov complexity We could define semantic complexity of a set of sentences S as its Kolmogorov complexity, i We also analyze the complexity of ELIZA as Q-complexity, and argue that defining semantic complexity of NL interfaces as Q-complexity makes sense.
