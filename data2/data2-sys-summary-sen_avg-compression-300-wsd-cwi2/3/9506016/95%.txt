 The present focus is pronominal_phrase interpretation preferences of intersentential pronominal anaphora Although this aspect of interpretation cannot be neglected in a discourse processing model, its relevance to a logical model of discourse semantics and pragmatics has remained unclear An example of defeasible preferences is pronominal_phrase interpretation of pronominal_phrase pronoun he in discourse John hit Bill In 1993, I conducted a survey of pronoun interpretation preferences using pronominal_phrase discourse examples shown in Table 1 The present set of examples highlights four major sources of preference in pronoun interpretation SUBJECT Antecedent Preference, Pronominal Chain Preference, Grammatical Parallelism Preference, and Commonsense Preference SUBJECT Antecedent Preference Pronominal Chain Preference This processing tendency indicates that pronominal_phrase grammatical preference is processed faster than pronominal_phrase commonsense preference Grammatical Parallelism Preference In example L, pronominal_phrase parallelism preference overrides pronominal_phrase pronominal chain preference Utterance interpretation depends on pronominal_phrase context, and utterance meaning updates pronominal_phrase context Four major sources of preference have been identified in pronominal_phrase above pronoun interpretation examples The pragmatics subsystem contains sets of preference rules that, in certain combinations, could lead to conflicting preferences Existing logical semantic pronominal_phraseories employing dynamic interpretation rules (e It also contains pronominal_phrase evolving discourse structure, temporal structure, and event structure Both linguistic semantics and commonsense preferences apply on pronominal_phrase same discourse model Commonsense Knowledge Lascarides and Asher (1993) extend pronominal_phrase Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp, 1981) with pronominal_phrase interaction of defeasible rules for integrating a new utterance content into pronominal_phrase discourse information state The SUBJECT Antecedent Preference and Pronominal Chain Preference result from CENTER, GF ORDER, EXP ORDER, and EXP CENTER The Grammatical Parallelism Preference is PARA These are examples of pronominal_phrase defeasible Commonsense Rules (WK) stating pronominal_phrase preferred discourse model Take two examples: (1) John met Bill It may be pronominal_phrase general pattern of changing preferences during utterance interpretation The preference interaction patterns discussed here can perhaps be formulated as fine-grained upgrading inferences during utterance interpretation within pronominal_phrase proposed utterance interpretation architecture Utterance interpretation induces a complex interaction of defeasible rules in pronominal_phrase pragmatics subsystem There are grammatical preferences inducing fast entity-level inferences only indirectly suggesting pronominal_phrase preferred discourse model, and commonsense preferences inducing slow proposition-level inferences directly determining pronominal_phrase preferred discourse model The attentional state in pronominal_phrase context supports pronominal_phrase formulation of attentional rules that significantly affect pronoun interpretation preferences Vague predicates and functions represent various expression and construction types whose interpretation depends on pronominal_phrase discourse context Preferences are affected by computationally expensive open-ended commonsense inferences.
