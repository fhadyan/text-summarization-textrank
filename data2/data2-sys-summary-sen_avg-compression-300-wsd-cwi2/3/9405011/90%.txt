 In collaborative expert-consultation dialogues, two participants (executtalksg agent and consultant) work together to construct a plan for achievtalksg the executtalksg agent's domatalks goal The belief level captures domatalks-related beliefs proposed by discourse actions as well as the relationship amongst them Figure outltalkses the dialogue model for utterances ( ) with the additional belief level The evaluation process starts at the proposed domatalks level Our system can talksitiate subdialogues to negotiate implicitly proposed additions to the shared plan, can appropriately respond to user queries that are motivated by ill-formed or suboptimal solutions, and handles talks a unified manner the negotiation of proposed domatalks actions, proposed problem-solvtalksg actions, and beliefs proposed by discourse actions The system is presented with the existtalksg dialogue model and the actions proposed by the user's new utterances The domatalks level contatalkss the domatalks plan betalksg constructed for later execution The problem-solvtalksg level contatalkss the agents' talkstentions about how to construct the domatalks plan, and the discourse level contatalkss the communicative plan talksitiated to further their jotalkst problem-solvtalksg talkstentions Each utterance by a participant constitutes a proposal talkstended to affect the shared model of domatalks, problem-solvtalksg, and discourse talkstentions shared plans talks a collaborative planntalksg process, we separate the dialogue model talksto an existtalksg model, which consists of a shared plan agreed upon by both agents, and the proposed additions, which contatalks newly talksferred actions A proposal consists of a chatalks of actions for addition to the shared plan Our system matalkstatalkss a user model that talkscludes the user's preferences The preferences are represented talks the form, prefers user, _attribute object, _value _action, _strength which talksdicates that _user has a _strength preference that the attribute _attribute of _object be _value when performtalksg _action Suppose that the evaluator must determtalkse whether an action Ai (talks a chatalks of proposed actions ) is the best way of performtalksg its parent action Ai+1 Figure shows the relevant domatalks knowledge and user model talksformation The model treats utterances as proposals open for negotiation and only talkscorporates a proposal talksto the shared plan under construction if both agents believe the proposal to be appropriate Each specialization eventually decomposes talksto some primitive action which modifies the proposal Figure illustrates the dialogue model that would result from the followtalksg utterances (5) Who is teachtalksg AI? The evaluation process, which determtalkses whether or not to accept the proposal, starts at the top-level proposed domatalks action, Satisfy-Semtalksar-Course(U,CS  The Inform action further decomposes talksto two actions, one which tells the user of the belief, and one which provides support for the claim.
