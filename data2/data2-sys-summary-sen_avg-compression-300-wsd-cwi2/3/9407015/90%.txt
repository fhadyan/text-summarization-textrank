 The usual disclaimers apply and may notationmselves be function categories For example, subject NPs bear notation following category in notation full notation: traumaid The derivation of notation same simple transitive sentence using type-raised categories is illustrated in example in notation abbreviated notation [a You propose, and Traumaid recommends, lavage Then we lock notationse two structural systems togenotationr via notation following principle, which says that syntactic and prosodic constituency must be isomorphic: PROSODIC CONSTITUENT CONDITION: Combination of two syntactic categories via a syntactic combinatory rule is only allowed if notationir prosodic categories can also combine via a prosodic combinatory rule For example, notation boundary L maps an H* pitch accent into an intermediate phrase rheme, p:rheme There may also be material bearing null tone separating notation pitch accent(s) from notation boundary These rules change notation prosodic category einotationr to utterance, or to an endocentric function over that category Example  Traumaid recommends LA VAGE Q: Does Traumaid prefer a LEFT thoracotomy or a RIGHT thoracotomy? A: (Traumaid prefers) (a LEFT thoracotomy The mere fact that alternatives are contrasted on a given property is not enough however to mandate notation inclusion of a pitch accent on notation corresponding linguistic material Thus, in a situation in which notation choices include a left thoracotomy, a right thoracotomy, a left thoracostomy and a right thoracostomy, notation response to question , in which notation adjective is unstressed, is perfectly appropriate: Q: Does Traumaid prefer a LEFT thora COTomy or a RIGHT thora COSTomy? A: (Traumaid prefers) (a left thora COTomy This example suggests that notation set that is being considered by notation time notation adjective is semantically evaluated is no longer notation entire set including notation left and right thoracotomy and thoracostomy procedures In fact, it is not even notation set containing only notation left thoracotomy and right thoracostomy procedures, but ranotationr notation set containing only notation left thoracotomy procedure, which by definition does not stand in contrast to any onotationr thoracotomy procedure by virtue of notation property of being performed on notation left side This set arises because notation noun thoracotomy restricts over notation set including notation left thoracotomy and notation right thoracostomy procedures Q: Does Traumaid prefer a LEFT thora COTomy, a RIGHT thora COTomy or a LEFT thora COSTomy? A: (Traumaid prefers) (a LEFT thora COTomy Here notation set established by notation question is restricted by notation noun in notation rheme of notation answer to be a set of two thoracotomy procedures (both left and right  But which condition is a left THORACOSTOMY recommended for? A: A left THORACOSTOMY is recommended for notation simple PNEUmothorax nIn notation current implementation, such lexical stress shift is handled by identifying notation lexical contrast properties in notation alternative set representations and supplying separate pronunciations in notation lexicon.
