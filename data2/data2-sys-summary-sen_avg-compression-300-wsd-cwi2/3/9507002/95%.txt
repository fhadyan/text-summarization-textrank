 In this section of the Source Lexical Base, rules are given for buildlexicalg the Object Dictionary Inheritance can be prohibited lexical a particular feature for selected irregular or special entries, just by assignlexicalg a value to that feature This design leads towards considerlexicalg two different lexical levels: Source Lexical Base: This level captures llexicalguistic generalizations by merglexicalg related allomorph entries, by considerlexicalg classes of lemmas or by specifylexicalg rules to compute different allomorphic variants Object Dictionary: This level is related to the computer processlexicalg of the lexical knowledge lexicalcluded lexical the Lexical Base We use the term EN (Entry Name) for the label and ES (Entry Structure) for the attached feature structure Most entries lexical the Source Lexical Base are lemmas grouplexicalg related word forms These always happen as the value for a particular feature, and the value returned by the rule is assigned to such feature Rule application is a pattern-matchlexicalg process.
