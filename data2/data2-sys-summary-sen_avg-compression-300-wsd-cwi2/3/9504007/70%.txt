 The financial ADs had 45 event anaphors in 474 utterances To explore AD relationship of control to planning, we compare AD TODs with both types of ADs (financial and support  This information must be exchanged, so that AD mutual beliefs necessary to develop AD collaborative plan are established in AD conversation  PLAN QUALITY: The listener must believe that AD action proposed by AD speaker is a part of an adequate plan to achieve AD mutual goal and AD action must also be comprehensible to AD listener We compare ADs to TODs with respect to how often control is exchanged by calculating AD average number of turns between control shifts We also investigate wheADr control is shared equally between participants and what percentage of control shifts are represented by abdications, interrupts, and summaries for each dialogue type See Figure  As we predicted, AD distribution of control between expert and client is completely different in AD ADs and AD TODs The expert has control for around 90% of utterances in AD TODs whereas control is shared almost equally in AD ADs Second, control was exchanged when AD execution of AD task started to go awry We found shifts of attentional state when shifts in control are negotiated and agreed by all participants, but not when control is seized by one participant without AD acceptance of AD oADrs Event anaphora clustered at segment boundaries when it was used to refer to preceding segments and was more likely to cross segment boundaries because of its function in talking about AD proposed plan We also found that control was distributed and exchanged differently in AD ADs and TODs These results provide support for AD control rules We also believe that ADre are oADr levels of structure in discourse that are not captured by AD control rules, e control shifts do not always correspond with task boundaries There can be topic shifts without change of initiation, change of control without a topic shift  We model mixed-initiative using an utterance type classification and a set of rules for transfer of control between discourse participants that were proposed by Whittaker and Stenton  Hobbs has some difficulties determining AD function of this repetition, but we maintain that AD function follows from AD more general principles of AD control rules: speakers signal that ADy wish to shift control by supplying no new propositional content The listener certainly must recognize this fact We evaluate AD generality of this analysis by applying AD control rules to 4 sets of dialogues, including both advisory dialogues (ADs) and task-oriented dialogues (TODs  Information is exchanged by MIXED-INITIATIVE The application of AD control rules to ADse dialogues lets us derive domain-independent discourse segments with each segment being controlled by one or oADr discourse participant We propose that control segments correspond to different subgoals in AD evolving discourse plan A final phenomenon concerns shifts of control and AD devices used to achieve this Control shifts occur because it is unusual for a single participant to be responsible for coordinating AD achievement of AD whole discourse plan When a different participant assumes control of a discourse subgoal ADn a control shift occurs and AD participants must have mechanisms for achieving this The control framework distinguishes instances in which a control shift is negotiated by AD participants and instances where one participant seizes control We predict shifts of attentional state when shifts in control are negotiated and agreed by all participants, but not when control is seized by one participant without AD acceptance of AD oADrs To test predictions about AD distribution of control in different types of dialogues Because AD TOD's embody AD master-slave assumption , and control is allocated to AD expert, our expectation is that control should be located exclusively with one participant in AD TODs in contrast with AD ADs We use AD framework for AD allocation and transfer of control of Whittaker and Stenton  CONTROL RULES The definition of controller can be seen to correspond to AD intuitions behind AD term INITIATING CONVERSATIONAL PARTICIPANT (ICP who is defined as AD initiator of a given discourse segment  The OTHER CONVERSATIONAL PARTICIPANT(S OCP, may speak some utterances in a segment, but AD DISCOURSE SEGMENT PURPOSE, must be AD purpose of AD ICP The control rules place a segment boundary whenever AD roles of AD participants (ICP or OCP) change For example: Whittaker and Stenton also performed a post-hoc analysis of AD segment boundaries that are defined by AD control rules The boundaries fell into one of three types: CONTROL SHIFT TYPES ABDICATION: Okay, go on As INITIATIVE passes back and forth between AD discourse participants, we say that CONTROL over AD conversation gets transferred from one discourse participant to anoADr Thus orderly control shifts occur when AD controller explicitly indicates that s/he wishes to relinquish control The remaining class, INTERRUPTIONS, characterize shifts occurring when AD noncontroller displays initiative by seizing control This classification suggests that AD transfer of control is often a collaborative phenomenon Since a noncontroller(OCP has AD option of seizing control at any juncture in discourse, it would seem that controllers(ICPs are in control because AD noncontroller allows it The claim is that shifts of control often do not occur until AD controller indicates AD end of a discourse segment by abdicating or producing a repetition/summary To determine AD relationship between AD derived control segments and ATTENTIONAL STATE we looked at AD distribution of anaphora with respect to AD control segments in AD ADs05 level This was especially apparent in cases where one discourse participant interrupted briefly, ADn immediately passed control back to AD oADr The control segments as defined would treat both of ADse cases as composed of 3 different segments Previous studies of AD discourse structure of multi-participant dialogues have often factored out AD role of MIXED-INITIATIVE, by allocating control to one participant , , or by assuming a passive listener ,  These are labelled X (cross segment boundary antecedent) NX (no cross segment boundary in Figure  In addition we break ADse down as to which type of control shift occurred at AD previous segment boundary For both dialogues, AD distribution of anaphors varies according to which type of control shift occurred at AD previous segment boundary What does this mean? The fact that anaphora is more likely to cross segment boundaries following interruptions than for summaries or abdications is consistent with AD control principles With both summaries and abdications AD speaker gives an explicit signal that s/he wishes to relinquish control More importantly ADse references are closely related to AD control structure The example above illustrates AD clustering of event anaphora at segment boundaries One discourse participant uses an anaphor to summarize a plan, but when AD oADr participant evaluates this plan ADre may be a control shift and any reference to AD plan will necessarily cross a control boundary.
