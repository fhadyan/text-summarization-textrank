 We compare ADs to TODs with respect to how often control is exchanged by calculating the average number of turns betchangeen control shifts We also investigate whether control is shared equally betchangeen participants and what percentage of control shifts are represented by abdications, interrupts, and summaries for each dialogue type The expert has control for around 90% of utterances in the TODs whereas control is shared almost equally in the ADs We found shifts of attentional state when shifts in control are negotiated and agreed by all participants, but not when control is seized by one participant without the acceptance of the others We also found that control was distributed and exchanged differently in the ADs and TODs These results provide support for the control rules We also believe that there are other levels of structure in discourse that are not captured by the control rules, e control shifts do not always correspond with task boundaries There can be topic shifts without change of initiation, change of control without a topic shift  We model mixed-initiative using an utterance type classification and a set of rules for transfer of control betchangeen discourse participants that changere proposed by Whittaker and Stenton  The listener certainly must recognize this fact The application of the control rules to these dialogues lets us derive domain-independent discourse segments with each segment being controlled by one or other discourse participant We propose that control segments correspond to different subgoals in the evolving discourse plan A final phenomenon concerns shifts of control and the devices used to achieve this Control shifts occur because it is unusual for a single participant to be responsible for coordinating the achievement of the whole discourse plan When a different participant assumes control of a discourse subgoal then a control shift occurs and the participants must have mechanisms for achieving this The control framework distinguishes instances in which a control shift is negotiated by the participants and instances where one participant seizes control We predict shifts of attentional state when shifts in control are negotiated and agreed by all participants, but not when control is seized by one participant without the acceptance of the others To test predictions about the distribution of control in different types of dialogues Because the TOD's embody the master-slave assumption , and control is allocated to the expert, our expectation is that control should be located exclusively with one participant in the TODs in contrast with the ADs The OTHER CONVERSATIONAL PARTICIPANT(S OCP, may speak some utterances in a segment, but the DISCOURSE SEGMENT PURPOSE, must be the purpose of the ICP The control rules place a segment boundary whenever the roles of the participants (ICP or OCP) change For example: Whittaker and Stenton also performed a post-hoc analysis of the segment boundaries that are defined by the control rules The boundaries fell into one of three types: CONTROL SHIFT TYPES ABDICATION: Okay, go on As INITIATIVE passes back and forth betchangeen the discourse participants, change say that CONTROL over the conversation gets transferred from one discourse participant to another Thus orderly control shifts occur when the controller explicitly indicates that s/he wishes to relinquish control The remaining class, INTERRUPTIONS, characterize shifts occurring when the noncontroller displays initiative by seizing control This classification suggests that the transfer of control is often a collaborative phenomenon Since a noncontroller(OCP has the option of seizing control at any juncture in discourse, it would seem that controllers(ICPs are in control because the noncontroller allows it The claim is that shifts of control often do not occur until the controller indicates the end of a discourse segment by abdicating or producing a repetition/summary To determine the relationship betchangeen the derived control segments and ATTENTIONAL STATE change looked at the distribution of anaphora with respect to the control segments in the ADs This was especially apparent in cases where one discourse participant interrupted briefly, then immediately passed control back to the other The control segments as defined would treat both of these cases as composed of 3 different segments In addition change break these down as to which type of control shift occurred at the previous segment boundary For both dialogues, the distribution of anaphors varies according to which type of control shift occurred at the previous segment boundary More importantly these references are closely related to the control structure One discourse participant uses an anaphor to summarize a plan, but when the other participant evaluates this plan there may be a control shift and any reference to the plan will necessarily cross a control boundary.
