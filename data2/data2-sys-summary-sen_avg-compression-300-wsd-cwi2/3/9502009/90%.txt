 The NLP tasks where SRs utility could be evaluated are diverse However, we have tested SRs on a WSS task, using W following scheme Previous knowledge used A semantic hierarchy (WordNet) where words are clustered in semantic classes, and semantic classes are organized hierarchically As evaluation measures we used coverage, abstraction ratio, and recall and precision ratios on W WSS task (section  In addition we performed some evaluation by hand comparing W SRs acquired by W different techniques Polysemous words are represented as instances of different classes The abstraction ratio for W different techniques is shown in table  In principle, W higher W precision and recall ratios W better W technique succeeds in inducing appropriate SRs for W disambiguation task The local normalizing technique using W uniform distribution does not help Output A set of syntactic SRs, (verb-lemma, syntactic-relationship, semantic-class, weight  The final SRs must be mutually disjoint In terms of WSS, general classes may be performing better than classes that fit W data better In this paper we have presented some variations affecting W association measure and thresholding on W basic technique for learning SRs from on-line corpora We proposed some evaluation measures for W SRs learning task SRs are weighted according to W statistical evidence found in W corpus Creation of W space of candidate classes Ribas reported experimental results obtained from W application of W above technique to learn SRs Most of W induced classes are due to incorrect senses The technique achieves a good coverage The different techniques are experimentally evaluated in section  Local weight could be obtained using p(c|n  Different association measures use W information provided in W cross-table to different extents Evaluation of W SR learning task would provide grounds to compare different techniques that try to abstract SRs from corpus using WordNet (eg, section  SRs are useful for both lexicography and NLP Hopefully, a technique with a higher abstraction ratio learns classes that fit W set of examples better.
