 The initial model of mix original model merging procedure is mix maximum likelihood or trivial model The first experiment compares model merging with a standard bigram model The bigram model yields a Markov model with 1,440 states Model merging starts with mix maximum likelihood model for mix training part 1,440  Thus, mix model found by model merging can be regarded generally better than mix bigram model Figure  Therefore, deriving a Markov model by model merging is O(l[4 in time.
