 Merging starts with one of the constraints The initial model of the original model meeting procedure is the maximum likelihood or trivial model This model has the advantage of directly representing the corpus The initial model must have two properties: 1 The trivial model has both properties The first experiment compares model meeting with a standard bigram model The bigram model yields a Markov model with 1,440 states Model meeting starts with the maximum likelihood model for the training parte when a bigram model is reached  What happens to the test part? Model meeting starts with a very special model which then is generalized Model meeting finds a model with 113 states, which assigns a log perplexity of 2 Thus, in addition to finding a model with lower log perplexity than the bigram model (2 The bigram model assigns a log perplexity of 278, the merged model with 113 states assigns a log perplexity of 2 Thus, the model found by model meeting can be regarded generally better than the bigram model This yields a bigram model For a larger training corpus, the optimal model should be closer in size to the bigram model, or even larger than a bigram model We investigated model meeting, a technique to induce Markov models from corpora Additionally, the merged model was much smaller than the bigram model Instead of starting with the trivial model, one can start with a smaller, easy-to-produce model, but one has to ensure that its size is still larger than the optimal model There are several methods to estimate model parameters Model meeting is a technique for inducing model parameters for Markov models from a text corpus Model meeting induces Markov models in the following way Merging starts with an initial, very general modele a model that exactly matches the corpus This model is also referred to as the trivial model The trivial model assigns a probability of to the corpus The criterion for selecting states to merge is the probability of the Markov model generating the corpus The probability never increases because the trivial model is the maximum likelihood model, ie it maximizes the probability of the corpus given the model Model meeting stops when a predefined threshold for the corpus probability is reached Therefore, deriving a Markov model by model meeting is O(l[4 in time When applying model meeting one can observe that first mainly states with the same output are merged.
