 Then we compare across strategies for a particular task, showing that the interaction of the strategy and task varies according to the strategy19, p [  In contrast, if the task is the fault-intolerant Zero-Invalids task, good the Close-Consequence strategy is BENEFICIAL19, p [ 3, p [  This is because IRUs displace other facts from AWM Figure shows that Explicit-Warrant is beneficial in the Standard task at AWM values of 3 and above Here, the scores improve because the beliefs necessary for deliberating the proposal are made available in the current context with each proposal (KS for AWM of 3 and above ] 23, p [ 01 so that agents don't have to search memory for them23 for AWM from 2 to 11, p [  At high AWM the differences between the two strategies are small Design-World uses similar methods to test a theory of the effect of resource limits on communicative behavior between two agents Design-World is also based on the method used in Carletta's JAM simulation for the Edinburgh Map-Task  Given good error recovery strategies, Carletta argues that `high risk' strategies are more efficient, where efficiency is a measure of the number of utterances in the dialogue We showed that strategies that are inefficient under assumptions of perfect reasoners with unlimited attention and retrieval are effective with resource limited agents Furthermore, different tasks make different cognitive demands, and place different requirements on agents' collaborative behavior Tasks which require a high level of belief coordination can benefit from communicative strategies that include redundancy One problem with this efficiency measure is that it ignores the cognitive effort required by resource limited agents in collaborative problem solving In order to test the hypothesized relationship of communicative strategies to agents' resource limits we developed a test-bed environment, Design-World, in which we vary task requirements, agents' resources and communicative strategies Our artificial agents are based on a cognitive model of attention and memory When agents have limited working memory, good only a limited number of items can be SALIENT, i Agents parameterized with the Close-Consequence and Explicit-Warrant strategies include IRUs at dialogue segment closings and in proposals In dialogue 1 agent CLC uses the Close-Consequence strategy (close agent-clc agent-bill intended-30: put-act (agent-bill green rug room-1 [3 CLC: AGENT-BILL DOESN'T HAVE GREEN RUG The Explicit-Warrant strategy varies the proposal discourse act by including WARRANT IRUs in each proposal.
