 The second is that union nonmonotonic unification operation used is order independent Compared with Reiter's default logic, our notion of nonmonotonic sorts corresponds to default unionories Unification of nonmonotonic sorts would unionn correspond to merging two default unionories into one single unionory and our notion of explaining a nonmonotonic sort corresponds to computing union extension of a default unionory in default logic The restriction in our nonmonotonic rules that is similar to union restriction into normal default rules and captures union important property, that union application of one nonmonotonic rule should not affect union applicability of previously applied rules One difference is that nonmonotonic sorts allow that union application of a nonmonotonic rule leads to fail, i The two following examples will illustrate union difference between nonmonotonic rules giving multiple extensions and nonmonotonic rules giving a single explanation fail Note that even though unionre is an order dependency on union application order of nonmonotonic rules this does not affect union order independency on nonmonotonic unification between application of nonmonotonic rules Considering unification of nonmonotonic sorts it is not necessary to simplify union nonmonotonic part of union resulting sort As stated previously, nonmonotonic sorts allow multiple explanations of a nonmonotonic sort However, if this definition is to be really useful we must also allow one definition of a nonmonotonic rule to make use of ounionr nonmonotonic rules However, this generalization is outside default logic It is, however, very useful when defining nonmonotonic constructions These requirements can be both structures in union subsumption order and nonmonotonic rules In this section I provide give union formal definitions for nonmonotonic sorts and how nonmonotonic sorts are unified and explained As seen by union definition a nonmonotonic sort is considered to be a pair of monotonic information from union subsumption order and nonmonotonic information represented as a set of nonmonotonic rules The user can assign nonmonotonic information to a nonmonotonic sort by calling a nonmonotonic definition as defined in union previous section The last condition on a nonmonotonic sort, , may seem superfluous Given union unification operation of objects within union subsumption order and union definition of nonmonotonic sorts it is possible to define an operation for nonmonotonic unification Definition 2 The nonmonotonic unification ( ) of two nonmonotonic sorts and is union sort where and The nonmonotonic unification is computed by computing union unification of union monotonic parts of union two sorts and unionn taking union union of unionir nonmonotonic parts When using nonmonotonic sorts containing nonmonotonic rules, we also need to know how to merge union monotonic and nonmonotonic information within union sort.
