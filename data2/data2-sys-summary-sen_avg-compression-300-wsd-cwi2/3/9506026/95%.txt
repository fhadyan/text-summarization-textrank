 This is illustrated below: One consequence of the present approach is that Jack run along the river for two miles and Jack run two miles along the river are assigned rather different representations To see that consequence representation is also concise, note that one can also derive numerous other sentences from consequence structure, given appropriate rules of inference: for example, Jack filled a bucket, Jack filled something, etcg bucket A, bucket E  Moreover, consequence representation is similarly concise: given appropriate rules of inference, one can also derive Jack poured water into bucket A for twenty-five seconds, Jack poured water into bucket A for twenty seconds, and so forth For example, with our pouring process (e the agent (Jack) and the goal (bucket A) remain constant across the particular events which make up the continuum This explains why sentences like Jack ran along the river, two hundred yards from the shore, for thirty seconds should be well-formed.
