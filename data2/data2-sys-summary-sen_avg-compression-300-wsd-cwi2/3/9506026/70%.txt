 By making this natural assumption, we may then explain the curious fact that * Jack ran to the bridge for two miles is horrible, in sharp contrast to both Jack ran two miles to the bridge and Jack ran along the river for two miles This is illustrated below: One consequence of the present approach is that Jack run along the river for two miles and Jack run two miles along the river are assigned rather different representations for further details  To see that this representation is also concise, note that one can also derive numerous other sentences from this structure, given appropriate rules of inference: for example, Jack filled a bucket, Jack filled something, etcg bucket A, bucket E  As a second example, let us now consider the following representation of a pouring process e1: It should be evident once again that this structure can be straightforwardly translated into the English sentence Jack poured water into bucket A for thirty seconds Moreover, this representation is similarly concise: given appropriate rules of inference, one can also derive Jack poured water into bucket A for twenty-five seconds, Jack poured water into bucket A for twenty seconds, and so forth Jack poured five gallons of water into bucket A *for/in thirty seconds contrariwise, switching to a bare plural in the first example, we may note a switch in the opposite direction (cf Jack filled buckets for in twenty minutes  Turning now to the second question, we should first note that Jack poured water into bucket A and Jack filled bucket A with water exhibit different aspectual behavior, despite the presence of the same mass noun As Krifka points out, the conventional wisdom about aspectual composition does not appear to be compatible with a sortal approach: For consider a concrete event of running and a concrete event of running a mile; then surely both events have a terminal point (both events might even be identical  The difference is that an event of running might be part of another event of running which has a later terminal point, whereas this is not possible for an event of running a mile For this reason, Krifka eschews sortal distinctions (amongst eventualities) and develops an account based upon the reference properties of event predicates instead also Verkuyl grammatically, run more than a mile patterns with run a mile, yet according to Krifka's test, run more than a mile patterns with run (note that an event of running more than a mile might be part of another event of running more than a mile  One possibility is to assume that substances and processes are more abstract entities than objects and events: for example, rather than letting a substance be a particular quantity of matter, we may assume a substance is a continuum of such quantities; likewise, we may take a process to be a continuum of events with differing durations This yields the following representations for our example sentences: To paraphrase, in the first case e1 is an event of duration thirty seconds which is composed of a process e in which Jack pours the substance x, which is water, into bucket A In the second case, e1 is instead an event (again of duration thirty seconds) in which Jack pours the object x1 into bucket A, where x1 is a five-gallon quantity (composed of the substance x(which is again water  various concrete objects) when the relevant participant remains constant across the continuum For example, with our pouring process (e the agent (Jack) and the goal (bucket A) remain constant across the particular events which make up the continuum First, suppose our knowledge base contains the first representation of the event e1 given near the end of the preceding section, repeated below: From this representation of e1, we should be able to derive the existence of an event e2 in which Jack pours water into bucket A for twenty-five seconds, as well as an event e3 in which he does so for twenty seconds, and so forthe that each directed motion event has a unique (delimited) path and time interval associated with it With directed motion processes, however, this cannot be the case, given the present conception of predication over continua: while a continuum of motion events may have the same agent and the same manner of motion, the path traversed does not remain constant to the bridge which specify endpoints, we may naturally assume that their translations are only well-sorted with delimited paths, since endpoints do not remain constant across a continuum of such paths As a result, expressions such as Jack run to the bridge will give rise to predicates restricted to events, in contrast to Jack run (which can apply to processes as well  This explains why * Jack ran to the bridge for thirty seconds is not well-formed, as illustrated below (recall that the composed-of relation serves to map processes to events Unlike to-phrases, towards-phrases do make sense for non-delimited paths, since these specify direction rather than endpoints (and direction can remains constant across a continuum  As such, Jack ran towards the bridge for thirty seconds receives the following well-formed translation: As an aside, it is worth observing that non-delimited paths need not be unbounded Although the continuum e may contain events larger than e1, it cannot contain any events larger than the event in which Jack reaches the bridge, as the path of any such event would no longer satisfy the predicated yielded instance towards the bridge the distance between the path and the reference object, which can remain constant across a path continuum This explains why sentences like Jack ran along the river, two hundred yards from the shore, for thirty seconds should be well-formed Consequently, bare distance phrases will behave just like to-PPs, which explains both why Jack ran two miles to the bridge is fine and why * Jack ran two miles for ten minutes is out.
