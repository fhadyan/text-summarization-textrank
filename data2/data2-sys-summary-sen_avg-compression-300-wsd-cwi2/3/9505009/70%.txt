 Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) and Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) are two frameworks which so far have been largely pursued in parallel, taking little or no account of each other Although the encoding of selection information by SFs in HPSG is somewhat different than that traditionally employed in TAG, we also adopt the notion that the extremities of the spine in an auxiliary tree share some part (but not necessarily all) of the selection information Thus, once we have produced a tree, we examine the root and the nodes in its frontier A tree is an auxiliary tree if the root and some frontier node (which becomes the foot node) have some non-empty SF value in common Initial trees are those that have no such frontier nodes In the trees shown, nodes detected as foot nodes are marked with  Note that in the tree T1 anchored by an equi-verb, the foot node is detected because the SLASH value is shared, although the SUBJ is not non-local distinction in HPSG cuts across the relations that are localized in TAG via the domains defined by elementary trees Raising Verb (and Infinitive Marker to) Above, we noted that the preservation of some SFs along a path (realized as a path from the root to the foot of an auxiliary tree) does not imply that all SFs need to be preserved along that path To allow for adjoining of auxiliary trees whose root and foot differ in their SFs, we could produce a number of different trees representing partial projections from each lexical anchor Each partial projection could be produced by raising some subset of SFs across each domination link, instead of raising all SFs Consider T1 whose root and foot differ in their SFs Having an empty SUBJ list at the top of the domination link would then allow for adjunction by trees such as T1 In the first phase, all SFs are raised It is determined which trees are auxiliary trees, and then the relationships between the SFs associated with the root and foot in these auxiliary trees are recorded However, immediately after applying a rule schema, the features at the bottom of a domination link are compared with the foot nodes of auxiliary trees that have differing SFs at foot and root Whenever the features are compatible with such a foot node, the SFs are raised according to the relationship between the root and foot of the auxiliary tree in question This process may need to be iterated based on any new auxiliary trees produced in the last phase Most of the relevant HPSG rule schemata and lexical entries necessary to derive this sentence were already given above to give to Sandy Adjunction involves the identification of the foot node with the bottom of the domination link and identification of the root with top of the domination link Since the domination link at the root of the adjoined tree mirrors the properties of the adjunction site in the initial tree, the properties of the domination link are preserved The final derivation step then involves the adjunction of the tree for the equi verb into this tree, again at the topmost domination linkg VPs) that is not possible in traditional TAG We have also developed a scheme to effectively organize the trees associated with lexical items For example, HPSG typically assumes a rule schema which combines a subject phrase (e On the other hand, in a lexicalized TAG derivation, a tree structure corresponding to the combined instantiation of these two rule schemata is directly retrieved along with the lexical item for the verb Given the greater expressive power of the HPSG formalism, it will not be possible to compile an aribitrary HPSG grammar into a TAG grammar From a TAG perspective, using concepts employed in the HPSG framework, we provide an explicit method of determining the content of the elementary trees (e This also provides a method for deriving the distinctions between initial and auxiliary trees, including the identification of foot nodes in auxiliary trees In the following we will first briefly describe the basic constraints we assume for the HPSG input grammar and the resulting form of TAG Next we describe the essential algorithm that determines the projection of trees from the lexicon, and give formal definitions of auxiliary tree and foot node We do not assume atomic labelling of nodes, unlike traditional TAG, where the root and foot nodes of an auxiliary tree are assumed to be labelled identically However, this identity itself isn't sufficient to identify foot nodes, as more than one frontier node may be labelled the same as the root Our translation process yields a lexicalized feature-based TAG in which feature structures are associated with nodes in the frontier of trees and two feature structures (top and bottom) with nodes in the interior Adjoining separates them by introducing the path from the root to the foot node of an auxiliary tree as a further specification of the underspecified domination link Head-Subj-Schema While in TAG all arguments related to a particular functor are represented in one elementary tree structure, the `functional application' in HPSG is distributed over the phrasal schemata, each of which can be viewed as a partial description of a local tree Add a node n dominating this node Add another node m dominating the root node of the instantiated schema We will fill in the details below in the following order: what information to raise across domination links (where adjoining may take place how to determine auxiliary trees (and foot nodes and when to terminate the projection We note that the trees produced have a trunk leading from the lexical anchor (node for the given lexical type) to the root The nodes that are siblings of nodes on the trunk, the selected daughters, are not elaborated further and serve either as foot nodes or substitution nodes This is again because meets in HPSG are not equivalent to lexical anchors in TAG, and that other local properties of the top and bottom of a domination link could differ Raising all SFs produces only fully saturated elementary trees and would require the root and foot of any auxiliary tree to share all SFs, in order to be compatible with the SF values across any domination links where adjoining can take place This is too strong a condition and will not allow the resulting TAG to generate all the trees derivable with the given HPSG (e Traditionally, in TAG, auxiliary trees are said to be minimal recursive structures that have a foot node (at the frontier) labelled identical to the root As such category labels (S, NP etc determine where an auxiliary tree can be adjoined, we can informally think of these labels as providing selection information corresponding to the SFs of HPSG Factoring of recursion can then be viewed as saying that auxiliary trees define a path (called the spine) from the root to the foot where the nodes at extremities have the same selection information If we take into account the adjoining constraints (or the top and bottom feature structures then it appears that the root and foot share only some selection information.
