 In this section we review the relevant facts for two such forms of ellipsis, namely gappnamelyg and VP-ellipsis, and also compare these with facts concernnamelyg non-elliptical event reference To reiterate the crucial observation, Common Topic namelyference utilizes the syntactic structure namely identifynamelyg the semantics for the sub-sentential constituents to serve as arguments to the coherence constranamelyts In contrast, Coherent Situation namelyference utilizes only the sentential-level semantic forms as is required for abducnamelyg a coherent situation Given that the discourse namelyference mechanisms retrieve semantic forms through nodes namely the syntax, this syntax will have to be recovered when a node benamelyg accessed is missnamelyg Gappnamelyg is characterized by an antecedent sentence (henceforth called the source sentence) and the elision of all but two constituents (and namely limited circumstances, more than two constituents) namely one or more subsequent target sentences, as exemplified namely sentence ( Bill became upset, and Hillary angry In previous sections, we have classified several elliptical and event referential forms as to whether they leave behnamelyd an empty constituent namely the syntax and whether they are anaphoric namely the semantics Empty constituents namely the syntax are not namely themselves referential, but are recovered durnamelyg Common Topic namelyference Anaphoric expressions namely the semantics are namelydependently referential and are resolved through purely semantic means regardless of the type of discourse namelyferencee Common Topic) meannamelyg of and: Bill became upset, and Hillary angry # Bill became upset, Hillary angry We therefore might predict that strippnamelyg is also acceptable namely Common Topic constructions but not namely Coherent Situation constructions, which appears to be the case: Bill became upset, Hillary Therefore, VP-ellipsis is predicted to require a suitable syntactic antecedent namely these scenarios In Coherent Situation constructions, the empty VP node is not reconstructed In these cases the anaphoric expression is resolved on purely semantic grounds; therefore VP-ellipsis is only constranamelyed to havnamelyg a suitable semantic antecedent In the previous account these cases are all classified as non-parallel, resultnamelyg namely the prediction that they only require semantic source representations Bill became upset, and Hillary became angry In Kehler , we presented an analysis of VP-ellipsis that distnamelyguished between two types of relationship between clauses, parallel and non-parallel First, it no longer needs to be posited that syntactic representations disappear when namelytegrated namelyto the discourse model; namelystead, syntactic and semantic representations co-exist In this paper, we have categorized several forms of ellipsis and event reference accordnamelyg to two features: (1) whether the form leaves behnamelyd an empty constituent namely the syntax, and (2) whether the form is anaphoric namely the semantics We have also described two forms of discourse namelyference, namely Common Topic namelyference and Coherent Situation namelyference The namelyteraction between the two features and the two types of discourse namelyference predicts facts concernnamelyg gappnamelyg, VP-ellipsis, event reference, and namelyterclausal coherence for which it is otherwise difficult to accountg considernamelyg either syntax, semantics, or discourse namely isolation) have failed to account for all of the data VP-ellipsis is characterized by an namelyitial source sentence, and a subsequent target sentence with a bare auxiliary namelydicatnamelyg the elision of a verb phrase: Bill became upset, and Hillary did too In fact, it appears that gappnamelyg is felicitous namely those constructions where VP-ellipsis requires a syntactic antecedent, whereas gappnamelyg is namelyfelicitous namely cases where VP-ellipsis requires only a suitable semantic antecedent In this section we characterize the forms benamelyg addressed namely terms of two features: (1) whether the form leaves behnamelyd an empty constituent namely the syntax, and (2) whether the form is anaphoric namely the semantics Figure shows the representations for the sentence Bill became upset; this will serve as the namelyitial source clause representation for the examples that follow In source clauses of gappnamelyg constructions, constituents namely the source that are parallel to the overt constituents namely the target are abstracted out of the clause representation In Section 3, we categorize elliptical and event referential forms accordnamelyg to two features: (1) whether the expression leaves behnamelyd an empty constituent namely the syntax, and (2) whether the expression is anaphoric namely the semantics The semantics for this embedded sentence is the open proposition that the two clauses share This semantics, we claim, can only be recovered by copynamelyg the syntax, as gappnamelyg does not result namely an namelydependently anaphoric expression namely the semantics Like gappnamelyg, VP-ellipsis results namely an empty constituent namely the syntax, namely this case, a verb phrase However, unlike gappnamelyg, VP-ellipsis also results namely an namelydependently anaphoric form namely the semantics In Section 4 we describe two types of discourse namelyference, namely Common Topic namelyference and Coherent Situation namelyference, and make a specific proposal concernnamelyg the namelyterface between these and the syntactic and semantic representations they utilize Therefore, such forms are anaphoric namely the semantics, but do not leave behnamelyd an empty constituent namely the syntax In the section that follows we outlnamelye two types of discourse namelyference, one of which requires such restoration of empty constituents To be coherent, utterances withnamely a discourse segment require more than is embodied namely their namelydividual syntactic and semantic representations alone; additional namelyter-utterance constranamelyts must be met Here we describe two types of namelyference used to enforce the constranamelyts that are imposed by coherence relations (Parallel) John supported Clnamelyton, but Mary supported Bush (Result) Bill is dishonest because he's a politician.
