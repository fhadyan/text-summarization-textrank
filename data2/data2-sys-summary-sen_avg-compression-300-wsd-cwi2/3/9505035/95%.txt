 The Xerox Tagger HREF= 9505035 HREF= 9505035 This way, ambiguity classes are annotated with favoured tags The Xerox Tagger uses a statistical method for text tagging The full 1M word subset of tagger corpus being postedited has been used as tagger training corpus, leaving file SP_itu_corpus_000 as tagger test corpus This corpus contains 9,366 tagged tokens The first one makes use of a tagged training corpus continuous invariant multi-word units  present, using a corpus different to that used for training, results sensibly better for French (96 While use a tagset consisting of 88 tags and a tagset with 42 tags, our tagset has 466 different tags uses this method for training a text tagger The number of equivalence classes (referred to as ambiguity classes in HREF= 9505035 Besides, relatively few ambiguity classes are sufficient for wide coverage, so it is unlikely that adding new words to tagger lexicon requires retraining, as taggerir ambiguity classes are accomodated Words not found in tagger lexicon are assigned an ambiguity class according to both context and suffix information The set of tags identifies an ambiguity class, which is also delivered by tagger lexicon The training module takes long sequences of ambiguity classes as input The tagging module buffers sequences of ambiguity classes between sentence boundaries This function also operates on an untagged training corpus It taggern eliminates those tags not included in tagger ambiguity class for tagger open class and, afterwards, tries to match tagger remaining tags with one of tagger existing ambiguity classes If it succeeds, this ambiguity class is assigned to tagger suffix.
