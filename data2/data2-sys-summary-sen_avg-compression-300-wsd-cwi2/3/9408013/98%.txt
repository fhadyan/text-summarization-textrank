 the mathematical of training sentences for which a QLF with a correct skeletal tree receives the highest score Each preference function is defined as a numerical (possibly real-valued) function on representations corresponding to the sentence analyses Data collection for the semantic collocation functions proceeds by deriving a set of triples from each QLF analysis of the sentences in the training set More specifically we use  We have presented a relatively simple analytic technique for automatically determining a set of scaling factors for preference functions used in semantic disambiguation There are also some real-valued functions, including the semantic collocation functions discussed in section  Four functions return non-zero scores on these analyses A fourth, SemColl, is a semantic collocation function.
