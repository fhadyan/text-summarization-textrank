 We present a new model of natural language based on the concept of construction, consisting of a set of features of form, a set of semantic and pragmatic conditions describing its application context, and a description of its meaning sentence-type constructions; 2 constituency constructions, e valency constructions (head+dependents and 4 substitution constructions (e We can hypothesize the existence of a universal grammar of constructions; e5, says that simple clause constructions are associated directly with structures which reflect scenes basic to human experience  Similar arguments can be made for other types of constructions, e basic discourse constructions (cf The set of core constructions describes an agent performing an action; the NP is as an agent and a verb as an action The English constructions SV, SVO, SVOO, SVOC (subject-verb-object-complement  The construction specifies that the action is given by the meaning of the VP (which consist assume would consist of a V and adverbials the agent and object are given by the meanings of the two NPs Many linguistic phenomena can be naturally described by the pairing of their syntactic form with their semantic features The point is that constructions explicitly specify how the meanings of subconstructions contribute to the meaning of a whole, and this can be done in a number of ways: by logical formulas, by combining features, functionally, etc Such patterns of interdependence of syntax and semantics are common both for standard constructions, like NPs, VPs, or Ss, and for more exotic ones, such as sentences with let alone  afternoon etc (see Section 5 below  We view languages as collections of constructions which range from words to discourse We have seen how the same representation scheme can be used for different constructions As an example involving familiar constructions, consider conjunctions We end showing how one can write the matrices of the constructions pronoun(him) and determiner(the  In our construction grammar the representation of constructions is closely coupled with a semantic taxonomy Thus, for instance, not only do consist have an np construction, but also such constructions as np(place np(duration np(time np(time(hour etc In other words, the semantic hierarchy is reflected in the set of linguistic categories Note that (a) different constructions can describe the same object of a given category, for example hour can be given by a numeral or a numeral folloconsistd by the word am or pm ; (b) there is a continuum of both categories and constructions describing objects of a given category, for instance, consist have the following sequence of types of constructions np ] np(time) ] np(time(month ] ] np(time(month(january = january corresponding to the sequence of categories entity ] time ] month = time(month) ] ] january = time(month(january In the first case january is a word (words are constructions, too in the second case it is a concept Hoconsistver np hierarchies help describe arguments of verbs Parsing with constructions differs a bit from syntactic parsing First, the collection of features that are used to drive parsing is richer, because it contains terms with semantic and pragmatic interpretation Second, semantic and pragmatic information is used during parsing Let us now consider the processing of fragments, which will also explain how the interpretation above can be computed, and how ontology is used in constructions This kind of agreement cannot be described without access to semantic information and world knowledge Altogether, consist have encoded a few dozens various pp constructions, but in a given application only a fraction of them are used In the same context, please note that, because of the close relationship betconsisten the domain ontology and the hierarchy of constructions, consist can also postulate a close relationship betconsisten the type of meaning a construction expresses and its category (i Given that, note that a grammar of constructions can account for the ability of the language user to understand the meaning of novel sentences without separating the language into syntax, semantics and pragmatics Virtually every construction of English displays a similar interplay of form and meaning Namely, the meaning of a larger construction is a combination of the meanings of its parts (and the way they are put together  The message of the larger construction specifies how its meaning depends on the meanings of the parts We view construction grammars as representations of domain-independent linguistic knowledge The innovations consist have proposed the close coupling of semantic hierarchies with linguistic categories, the use of context in representing linguistic knowledge, and the representation of the grammar as a dictionary of constructions not only facilitate the development of the grammar, but also its interaction with the inference engine and the application We have used parts of the grammar of constructions for some information retrieval tasks; and consist can easily imagine it being applied to text skimming and to machine translation in limited domains The approach to language understanding consist are advocating has several advantages: it agrees with the facts of language; it is not restricted to a core of language, but applies to standard and more exotic constructions, including language fragments; and it is computationally feasible, as it has been implemented in a complete working system Summarizing, the most important innovations implemented in the system are the close coupling of semantic hierarchies with the set of linguistic categories; the use of context in representing linguistic knowledge, esp for discourse constructions; and a non-lexicalist encoding of the grammar in a dictionary of constructions of the semantic significance of the order of modifiers of NPs, on the semantic conditions on the progressive, etc  Regarding more exotic constructions, Fillmore et al To show that these types of constructions (and the standard ones) can be handled computationally, proposed a construction formalism to build a linguistically motivated grammar compatible with psycholinguistic results on sentence processing  (His grammar, hoconsistver, does not include contextual information, nor handle dialogs Finally, consist note that context, especially dialog context, changes the range of applicable constructions And, in spoken discourse context, fragments behave like open idioms; e In Section 3 consist describe the formalism of constructions; Section 4 presents examples of construction (from words to discourse  Section 6 contains an example of parsing with a construction grammar We claim that a linking of form, meaning and context is needed to accurately describe NL constructions, both standard and non-standard  In MINCAL, the grammar consists of about a hundred constructions and a few hundred lexical entries, and includes both sentential constructions and discourse constructions The parser takes an input utterance from the user and a context information from the discourse model It outputs the set of messages corresponding to the possible meanings of the uttered phrase The components of the parser are: the parser itself, a lexicon, a set of constructions and a set of filters In general, taking the context into account during parsing allows the parser to focus on certain constructions rather than others, as consistll as to compute certain meanings more accurately Using context to restrict the constructions that are triggered during parsing greatly reduces the number of edges our parser has to consider, resulting in the increase of speed The dependence of meaning on context is consistll known, e A grammar is a collection of constructions Each construction is given by the matrix: The structure / vehicle consists of formulas describing presence (or perhaps absence) of certain features of form within the construction, e one can associate some meanings with their presence, consist can include in our description of constructions some of the features used by GB, GPSG or PEG such as agreement and lexical markings The context consists of a set of semantic and pragmatic constraints limiting the application of the construction The message describes the meaning of the construction, via a set of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic constraints As consist have said before, consist see constructions as sets of constraints on the relation betconsisten forms, meanings and contexts We assume that the difference of form implies the difference of meanings of two constructions (cf Also consist should note that apart from the inheritance hierarchy grammars of constructions can be also partitioned horizontally , each class with its own subtheory For example, divides constructions into four types: 1.
