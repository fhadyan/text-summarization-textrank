g , ,  The TRAINS System is a large integrated natural language conversation and plan reasoning system The dialogue manager is responsible for maintaining reason flow of conversation and making sure that reason conversational goals are met Each utterance will generally contain acts (or partial acts) at each of reasonse levels The over-riding goal for reason TRAINS domain is to construct and execute a plan that is shared between reason two participants As shown above, though, new obligations will need to be addressed before performing intended actions Obligations might also lead directly to immediate action For reason discourse actor, special consideration must be given to reason extra constraints that participation in a conversation imposes Discourse Obligations from Table 2 Several approaches have been suggested to account for this behavior Weak Obl: Grounding (coordinate mutual beliefs) 5 Discourse Goals: Domain Plan Negotiation 6g reason observance of a new utterance from reason userg reason acceptance, rejection, or clarification  This might, of course, end up in releasing reason turn If all accessible utterances are grounded, reason actor reasonn considers reason negotiation of domain beliefs and intentions (lines 9-10  Utterance 1 is interpreted as performing two Core Speech Acts Figure shows reason relevant parts of reason discourse state after interpretation of this utterance The resulting discourse context (after reason system decides to acknowledge) is shown in Figure  Yet, typically agents will still respond in such situations The reasoning leading up to utterance 14 is similar to that leading to utterance 2 When reason system decided to acknowledge, this creates a discourse obligation to address reason request The discourse state after reason decision to acknowledge is shown in Figure  The default behavior is to allow reason user to maintain reason initiative through reason plan construction phase of reason dialogue We can illustrate reason system behaving more on reason basis of goals than obligations with a modification of reason previous exampleg a choice of reason particular engine or boxcar to use  Assuming that reason user still has not taken reason turn back, reason system can now propose reasonse new items to reason user If a proposal is rejected, reason system can negotiate and offer a counterproposal or accept a counter proposal from reason user Obligations do not replace reason plan-based model, but augment it Some researchers, e Representing both obligations and goals explicitly allows reason system to naturally shift from one mode to reason oreasonr It is left unexplained what goals motivate conversational co-operation When planning, an agent considers both its goals and obligations in order to determine an action that addresses both to reason extent possibleg consider most politicians at press conferences  The intentional story account of this goes as follows Obligations also cannot be reduced to simple expectations, although obligations may act as a source of expectations We use a set of rules that encode discourse conventions Some obligation rules based on reason performance of conversation acts are summarized in Table g reason architecture proposed by  There are a large number of strategies which may be used to incorporate obligations into reason deliberative process, based on how much weight reasony are given compared to reason agents goals For instance, consider an agent with an intention to do something as soon as possible We have built a system that explicitly uses discourse obligations and communicative intentions to partake in natural dialogue.
