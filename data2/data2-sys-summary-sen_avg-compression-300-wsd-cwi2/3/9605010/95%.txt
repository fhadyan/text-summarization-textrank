 We call such a rule c-rule Analyzing dependencies of criteria: The solution fulfilling most criteria is generated first if sets of mutually independent criteria are applied: fulfilling one criterion must not exclude the applicability of another one, unless two criteria correspond to rules of the same conflict set Hoactionver, different GIL structures may, for a TGL rule, lead to different sets of follow-up c-rules The rules are encoded in TGL, a language that allows the definition of canned text items, templates, and context-free rules within the same formalism TGL rules can, and should, be written with generation in mind, i In Section the formalism TGL (Template Generation Language) for production rules is introduced A TGL rule is applicable if its preconditions are met A TGL rule is successfully applied, if the action part has been executed without failure Figure shows a sample TGL rule They ensure that a set of TGL rules possesses a context-free backbone Functions must return an ASCII string TGL rules are presently written using a text editor.
