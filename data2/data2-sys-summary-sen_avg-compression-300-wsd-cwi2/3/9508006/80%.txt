 Transfer based approaches to machine translation (MT) involve three main phases: analysis, approach and generation In its original formulation, LMT consists of three main phrases: analysis, lexical-semantic approach and generation Such restrictions need to be incorporated in the monolingual lexical signs and rules Implementationally, bilexical rules may be applied off-line in order to expand the bilexicon before processing, or they may be applied during approach to extend the bilexicon just sufficiently to enable approach We now show how bi-lexical rules can be used in the translation of `thirsty basing our analysis on the classification of support verbs proposed by for English-French translation The analysis phase involves parsing the input sentence to produce an output bag or multiset of SL lexical signs instantiated with sufficient information to permit appropriate translation Information regarding which support verb a noun requires is encoded in its lexical entry We will consider neutral support verbs only although the other categories could also be handled through bi-lexical rules Transfer maps these signs into a TL bag through the bilingual lexicon in which sets of source and target lexical signs are placed in translation correspondence The neutral (ntrl) control verb required by the English adjective is included in its lexical entry's Qualia structure During approach, the bi-lexical rule above is applied to the bi-lexical entry for `thirst' to yield: be1e,s,x, thirsty1x tener1e,s,x, sed1xThis multi-lexeme relation is used to translate `is thirsty' into tiene sed; a separate entry translates `John' into Juan The purpose of bi-lexical rules then is to minimize the repetition of information in the bi-lexicon while allowing the exploitation of monolingual lexical processes There are other translation phenomena which can be described through the use of bi-lexical rules To exemplify the use of bi-lexical rules in head switching, we consider translation in embedded contexts in more detail now This concludes our overview of the different translation mismatches that may be handled through bi-lexical rules One difficulty we have found with bilexical rules has been their composition One possible solution is to manually add further bi-lexical rules which incorporate the bi-lexical rules In our proposed approach either the causative or the lexicalization pattern bi-lexical rule, or both, incorporate a context variable in their output bilexical entry The causative rule requires the Spanish side to include an infinitive verb, while the lexicalization pattern rule requires a gerundive verb If the lexicalization pattern rule rather than the causative rule had included the contextual verb lexical sign, the gerundive marchando could not have been generated The implemented prototype system contains approximately 250 bilexical entries; this figure includes 20 proper names, 20 multi-lexeme translations and 6 contextual rules We have introduced the mechanism of bi-lexical rules for incorporating lexical rules in MT These rules establish correspondences between bilexical entries such that given the presence of one entry, the existence of another bilexical entry can be inferred Future work could consider implementing Mel'cuk's lexical functions ( ( in a manner similar to the way bi-lexical rules were used in the translation of support verbs TFSs of type qualia encode lexical semantic information based on the Qualia structures of  A bilexical entry for `John - Juan' would be: For reasons of space and convenience, we will abbreviate the above lexical sign and bilexical entry to 1x john1x juan1xrespectively, where the subscripts correspond to the argument variable To exemplify LMT, consider the translation of `John likes Mary  Before approach, a process similar to skolemization is applied to the approach representation in order to replace variables by constants By using sets of lexical signs as their approach representation, LMT systems can reduce the difficulties posed by structural mismatches between two languages, thus increasing the independence between source and target approach representations For example, approach systems adopting a recursive representation for approach ( as opposed to a non-recursive one ( may need additional mechanisms for handling head switching (  One type of phenomena that leads to complex approach in a number of systems may be called multi-lexical translation For our implementation we have extended the original SB formulation by postulating bilingual lexical rules (bi-lexical rules henceforth) which dynamically expand the bilingual lexicon in order to extend its functionality Consider for example the case of `John is thirsty its Spanish translation, Juan tiene sed (lit We will consider three During Spanish bag generation, the appropriate support verb (i A variation of this strategy would be to use a partially instantiated lexical sign corresponding to the English support verb: { john11 , support-verb2,1,3 , thirsty3 } During approach, the support verb is translated as a partially instantiated support verb in Spanish The second mechanism for capturing multi-lexeme regularities assumes translation variables similar to those used in several approach systems ( , ,  This is followed by a description of the problems posed by certain multi-lexeme translations, and of how bi-lexical rules, in conjunction with lexical semantic information provide a framework for overcoming these problems The third mechanism uses bilingual lexical rules to map bilexical entries into new bilexical entries Lexical rules may be thought of as establishing a relationship between lexical items such that given the presence of one lexical item in the lexicon the existence of a further item may be inferred A bi-lexical rule ( , ( takes a bilexical entry as input, and outputs a new bilexical entry Bi-lexical rules also serve to capture lexical, syntactic and semantic regularities in the translation between two languages by relating equivalent lexical processes cross-linguistically We give a simple example of a bi-lexical rule before addressing the multi-lexeme translations introduced earlier Consider the relationship that exists in English-Spanish translations between the translation of fruits and The relevant relationship may be described by the following bi-lexical rule: This bi-lexical rule says that if there is a bilexical entry translating English fruit nouns into Spanish fruit nouns, then there is a bilexical entry translating `noun tree' in English into a morphologically derived tree-denoting noun in Spanish.
