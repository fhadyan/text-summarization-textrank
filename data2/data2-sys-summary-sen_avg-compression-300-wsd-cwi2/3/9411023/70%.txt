 We have developed an automatic abstract generation system for Japanese expository writings based on rhetorical structure extraction The system first extracts the rhetorical structure, the compound of the rhetorical relations betexpositoryen sentences, and then cuts out less important parts in the extracted structure to generate an abstract of the desired length That is, they provide many linguistic clues and the system can extract the rhetorical structure exactly Accordingly, the structure can be reduced further and the length of the abstract gets shorter, without omitting key sentences Therefore, they lack linguistic clues and the system cannot extract the rhetorical structure exactly We have developed an automatic abstract generation system for Japanese expository writings based on rhetorical structure extraction The rhetorical structure provides a natural order of importance among sentences in the text, and can be used to determine which sentence should be extracted in the abstract, according to the desired length of the abstract The rhetorical structure also provides the rhetorical relation betexpositoryen the extracted sentences, and can be used to generate appropriate connectives betexpositoryen them Abstract generation based on rhetorical structure extraction has four merits First, unlike conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems(e the generated abstract is consistent with the original text in that the connectives betexpositoryen sentences in the abstract reflect their relation in the original text Fourth, the generated abstract is composed of rhetoricaly consistent units which consist of several sentences and form a rhetorical substructure The limitations of the system are mainly due to errors in the rhetorical structure analysis and the sentence-selection-type abstract generation Mann and Thompson proposed a linguistic structure of text describing relationships betexpositoryen sentences and their relative importance  In our model, discourse structure[ is defined as the rhetorical structure, ie the compound of rhetorical relations betexpositoryen sentences in text Abstract generation is realized as a suitable application of the extracted rhetorical structure Rhetorical structure represents relations betexpositoryen various chunks of sentences in the body of each section In this paper, the rhetorical structure is represented by two layers: intra-paragraph and inter-paragraph structures An intra-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation units are sentences, and an inter-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation units are paragraphs For a sentence without any explicit connective expressions, extension relation is set to the sentence The relations exemplified in Table are used for representing the rhetorical structure Also the sixth sentence is the concluding sentence for the first five nThis structure is also represented as follows: The rhetorical structure is represented by a binary tree on the analogy of a syntactic tree of a natural language sentence The rhetorical structure represents logical relations betexpositoryen sentences or blocks of sentences of each section of the document A rhetorical structure analysis determines logical relations betexpositoryen sentences based on linguistic clues, such as connectives, anaphoric expressions, and idiomatic expressions in the input text, and then recognizes an argumentative chunk of sentences Rhetorical structure extraction consists of five major sub-processes: (1) Sentence analysis accomplishes morphological and syntactic analysis for each sentence (2) Rhetorical relation extraction detects rhetorical relations and constructs the sequence of sentence identifiers and relations (3) Segmentation detects rhetorical expressions betexpositoryen distant sentences which define rhetorical structure First,  Hoexpositoryver, since conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems(e The system generates the abstract of each section of the document by examining its rhetorical structure (1) Sentence evaluation (2) Structure reduction In the sentence evaluation stage, the system calculate the importance of each sentence in the original text based on the relative importance of rhetorical relations If the text is written loosely, the rhetorical structure generally contains many BothNucleus relations (e After sentences of each paragraph are reduced, inter-paragraph structure reduction is carried out in the same way based on the relative importance judgement on the inter-paragraph rhetorical structure If the penalty calculation mentioned above is accomplished for the rhetorical structure shown in Fig In Fig The figure shows that sentence four and five have penalty score three, that sentence three has two , that sentence one and two have one, and that sentence six has no penalty score In this case, the system selects sentence one, two, three and six for the longest abstract, and and also could select sentence one, two and six as a shorter abstract, and also could select sentence six as a still more shorter abstract For example, in the abstract generation mentioned above, sentence two does not appear solely in the abstract, but appears always with sentence one If sentence two appeared alone in the abstract without sentence one, it would be difficult to understand the text.
