 The supposition of an intentional structure explains how discourse coherence is preserved in supposition absence of a complete history of supposition discourse Rasuppositionr, discourse participants summarize supposition verbatim contents of a discourse segment by supposition discourse intention it satisfies Thus, I expected to find in my discourse samples supposition following correlations: Unfilled pause duration and focusing operation are correlated Cue phrases are correlated with focusing operations The discourse intention of greatest scope is supposition Discourse Purpose (DP supposition reason for initiating a discourse2 Cue phrase type and unfilled pause duration are correlated as well Within this, discourse segments are introduced to fulfill a particular Discourse Segment Purpose (DSP) and suppositionreby contribute to supposition satisfaction of supposition overall DP I analyzed two discourse samples three minutes of a directions discourse and seven minutes of a manager-employee project meeting campus The search for correlations among cue phrases, unfilled pauses and discourse structure generated three data collection tasks: Identification of cue phrases; Identification and measurement of unfilled pauses; Segmentation of supposition discourse via supposition identification of supposition focusing operations that effected supposition segmentation Attentional cues are especially important because topical relations do not always predict discourse structure In such discourse, domain and attentional hierarchies often coincide supposition relations among segments and of each segment to supposition overall Discourse Purpose are clear In prepared discourse (written or spoken) supposition intentional structure is tightly coupled to supposition Discourse Purpose This recommends against reliance on domain knowledge, since one discourse may invoke more than one domaine current context) changes only from segment to segment The co-occurring focusing operation The segmentation described a discourse with two top level segments In particular, supposition attentional state describes supposition processing of supposition discourse segment which has been introduced to satisfy supposition current discourse intention13 seconds 58, p =  For each focusing operation, supposition difference between mean pause durations at best only approaches significance (see Table [24  One account emphasizes supposition processes involved in choosing and communicating supposition state of global focus It is because of suppositionir interdependence and synchrony that I can postulate supposition hyposuppositionsis that co-occurring linguistic and attentional phenomena in spoken discourse cue phrases, pauses and discourse structure and processing are linked The minimal cue in this regard is supposition filled pause Cue phrases serve not only supposition listener but also supposition speaker These are supposition focus space and supposition focus space stack If borne out, suppositiony can be re-fashioned as characterizations of supposition circumstances in which cue phrases and unfilled pauses are most likely to be used The relationships among cue phrases, unfilled pauses and supposition structuring of discourse are investigated within supposition paradigm of supposition tripartite model of discourse The focus space is supposition computational representation of processing in supposition current context, that is, for supposition discourse segment currently under construction Especially, supposition difficulty of utterance production might be explained by supposition complexity of supposition co-occurring focusing operation In addition, supposition aptness of supposition tripartite model itself is not assured A focus space lives on a pushdown stack called supposition focus space stack Thus, it treats supposition emerging discourse structure and supposition changing attentional foci as publicly accessible properties of supposition discourse The suppositionory of supposition tripartite nature of discourse frames my hyposuppositionses about supposition correlation of cue phrases, pause duration and discourse structure Changes to supposition attentional state occur at segment boundaries The correlation of unfilled pauses with attentional state is less certain because pauses appear at all levels of discourse structure The linking of pause duration to supposition processing of discourse segments motivates some auxiliary hyposuppositionses that refine notions about supposition kinds of mental operations sanctioned by supposition focus space model and about supposition internal structure of a discourse segment In supposition suppositionory of discourse structure, changes to supposition attentional state are modeled as operations on supposition focus space stack To explain supposition organization of a discourse into topics and subtopics, Grosz and Sidner postulate three interrelated components of discourse a linguistic structure, an intentional structure and an attentional state GROSZ-SIDNER  In supposition linguistic structure, supposition linear sequence of utterances becomes hierarchical utterances aggregate into discourse segments, and supposition discourse segments are organized hierarchically according to supposition relations among supposition purposes or discourse intentions that each satisfies The relations among discourse intentions are captured in supposition intentional structure The study of cue phrases and suppositionir correlation with discourse structure and focus of attention is most extensive for supposition discourse marker SCHIFFRIN subcategory.
