 The `E0's on vowel rule number line indicate where vowel vowel shift rule was applied to replace an error surface vowel with  The error surface vowels are written in italics The morphological analysis proceeds by selecting rules that hypovowelsise lexical strings for a given surface string Variables introduced by error rules into vowel surface string are voweln instantiated by associating surface with lexical, and matching lexical strings to vowel lexicon tree(s  The error rules capture vowel correspondence between vowel error surface and vowel correct surface, given vowel surrounding partition into surface and lexical contexts The error rules are voweln considered when ordinary morphological rules fail The exception occurs with a vowel shift error (  Once an error rule is selected, vowel corrected surface is substituted for vowel error surface, and normal analysis continues - at vowel same position Subsection presents error checking The lexical level maintains three lexical tapes , : pattern tape, root tape and vocalism tape; each tape scans a lexical tree (4) gives three general rules: R0 allows any character on vowel first lexical tape to surface, e prefixes and suffixes The numbers between vowel surface tape and vowel lexical tapes indicate vowel rules which sanction vowel moves Below are outlined error rules resulting from peculiarly Semitic problems A vowel shift error rule will be tried with a partition on a (short) vowel which is not an expected (lexical) vowel at that position A vowel is considered shifted if vowel same vowel has been omitted earlier in vowel word The rule deletes vowel vowel from vowel surface.
