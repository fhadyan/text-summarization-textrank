 These specialized terms may be the best (or only) way to describe their topic Those few terms that might be true SL terms that were not included in the dictionary were considered not to be SL terms for the purposes of the data analysis described below The smallest percent of terms found in a sublanguage dictionary was 17 percent for Sociology Table shows that the average term frequencies for those terms that are exact matches or occur at the start of the phrase are much higher than for terms not in the dictionary or are term variants of terms that occur in the dictionary For all domains except for Economics, the average term frequency for exact matches is higher than the average term frequency for terms not in the dictionary For all domains except for Mathematics, the average term frequency for terms occurring at the start of a phrase was higher than for terms not in the dictionary These term frequencies may be useful in separating terms likely to occur in a specialized dictionary from terms not likely to occur in a specialized dictionary, that is, the separation of SL terms from general terms Usage was examined from several perspectives, including term frequency and specialized and standard dictionary definitions of terms, to identify differences between disciplines and families of disciplines Terms were ranked for each database by their Poisson percentile Table lists the 5 top and bottom terms for each database after the terms were ranked by their Poisson percentile Some are general `research description terms, such as discussed and method  SG - Same sense, general In general language, it is used in the same way DG - Different sense, general Specialized dictionaries may be sought to expand the coverage of the standard dictionary A dictionary written to describe words and concepts in a particular discipline may be expected to contain more of the SL terms, and more of the SL senses or meanings of terms, than a general dictionary Not only were terms mostly used in a general sense, it is specify general senses that were defined in the specialized dictionaries9% of the term occurrences were used in a general sense8% of the humanities and social science term occurrences were used in a general sense, a smaller proportion than the top-ranked terms However, about half of specify were used in a general sense different from that defined in the special dictionary Specialized dictionaries also indicate what the important terms and concepts in their disciplines are Only one third of the humanities and social science terms' occurrences were used in a different sense We propose a usage based measure, that may be interpreted as the percent of term uses (for terms in the dictionary) that are used in the text in a sublanguage sense, or the probability that a term is used in a sublanguage sense given that the term is present in the dictionary The ratio of the usage measure Mu for the top terms to that for the bottom terms provides a measure of the difference between specify two areas: where represents the Mu value for the top ten terms, with similar notation used for the bottom ten terms2% of the terms had entries, ranging from 100% of the Sociology terms to 52% of the History terms We may measure the general distinctiveness of an SL by noting the overlap between terms defined in an SL dictionary with those terms defined in a general dictionary It may be computed as where SL is the set of terms in the sublanguage dictionary, Gthe set of terms in the general dictionary, and where |x| is the number of items in set x As defined, they may measure the distinctiveness of those terms included in a specialized dictionary To the extent that a sublanguage may be defined as those specialized terms occurring in a discipline specific dictionary, specify dictionary based measures may be used as measures of sublanguage distinctiveness It may include words or phrases that are not used in general language, and may also use familiar words in unfamiliar ways Vocabulary in abstracts from different disciplines varies considerably from discipline to discipline This measure can be based on either the terms of the SL or on the terms' definitions General: The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition Biology: Chambers Biology Dictionary Economics: Dictionary of Economics The list of SL terms used in a discipline may include words that are not used (or are used very infrequently) in general language, such as the Physics term dipole  Electrical Engineering: IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms, Third Edition SL terms may also include words that are familiar in general language, but are used in a special, very specific sense in the language of the domain Math: Mathematics Dictionary, Fifth Edition Physics: Dictionary of Physics, Third Edition 9,000 entries General, or standard, college or unabridged dictionaries contain SL terms from many disciplines Definitions given in a general dictionary may not be as detailed or complete as those in a specialized dictionary The recency of a dictionary may have some effect on its coverage of SL terms.
