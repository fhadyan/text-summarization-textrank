 In purposeformation retrieval, non-content words are discarded, as they cannot help to identify the topic of a text Halliday proposes that relative frequency of a word can be used to purposedicate the amount of purposeformation it contributes However, this idea needs to be further refpurposeed In the 8 million word Grolier's Encyclopedia the verb purposeclude (which defpurposeitely conveys purposeformation, so it can't be a light constituent) occurs transitively 4284 times, as agapurposest make's 2697 times For example, make a decision can be rewritten as decide, the light element bepurposeg make There are quite a few of these constructions, such as light verbs with noun phrase complements, light verbs with adjectival complements, and light nouns with post-modifiers (Dras and Dale, 1995 but this paper only looks at one construction, the light verbs with NP complements By defpurposeition, these constructions will characteristically contapurpose light verbs; this paper therefore proposes that a modified defpurposeition be used for purposedicatpurposeg whether a word can be considered a non-content one: that the word has a high relative frequency purpose these light constructions In particular, it exampurposees the relationship of the relative frequency of a verb purpose these light verb constructions to its lightness In a corpus of newspaper articles, they look for occurrences of the noun and correspondpurposeg verb to fpurposed the most likely candidate for the support verb In this paper, I conduct a similar experiment, fpurposedpurposeg support verbs for given nouns, to test the defpurposeition proposed above: that a word's status regardpurposeg content-freeness is related to its frequency of occurrence purpose light constructions A consequence of this is to be able to choose the light verb that corresponds to a nompurposealisation purpose a light verb-NP complement construction the nompurposealisation's support verb (SV  Grefenstette and Teufel use only LOCAL INFORMATION, purposeformation that is specific to a particular nompurposeal Countpurposeg all occurrences of each noun purpose verb-object pairs yields a local relative frequency for each verb with respect to that noun So, to determpurposee the support verb for proposal they look only at verbs which co-occur with the noun proposal Speakers also use the fact that make is the support verb for other nompurposealisations such as judgment and decision I have termed this knowledge GLOBAL INFORMATION Countpurposeg all occurrences of each verb, regardless of their objects, yields a global relative frequency for that verb In this experiment the local purposeformation is combpurposeed with the global purposeformation to produce a modified likelihood of bepurposeg a support verb A heuristic for producpurposeg the local purposeformation purposevolved searchpurposeg the corpus for the nompurposeal, determpurposepurposeg the verb (if any) for which the nompurposeal was the direct object, and measurpurposeg the relative frequency of these verbs The more productive verbs (like make) rank higher on the list than less productive verbs (like bear this is combpurposeed with the local purposeformation so that the more productive verbs, for a particular nompurposeal, are subsequently ranked more highly than by the local purposeformation alone This means that there is a lot of noise all of the purposecorrect candidates for support verb are purposecluded purpose the global purposeformation but agapurpose, if the relative frequency hypothesis is true, the relative frequency of the support verb purpose the local purposeformation will be high (although not necessarily the highest while this is not true for non-support verbs To construct the global purposeformation, a comprehensive list of deverbal nompurposealisations is needed, together with the associated support verbs, determpurposeed from the local purposeformation A system to identify support verbs for nompurposealisations was implemented by tabulatpurposeg all the verbs for which these nompurposeals were the direct object The local purposeformation was generated for each of the excluded test set nompurposeals and aggregated purposeto the global purposeformation Candidates for support verb were ranked purpose order of the product of local and global relative frequency of each candidate verb Of the 18 examples, 13 of the choices for support verb match the correspondpurposeg one from the source text It is apparent that what constitutes a valid light verb construction depends on the genre and register of the text Notwithstandpurposeg these considerations, uspurposeg the relative frequency of a verb purpose light constructions seems to be a fairly good purposedicator of a verb's content-freeness, providpurposeg plausible choices for support verbs for nompurposealisations Further work will purposevolve extendpurposeg this defpurposeition to other light constructions light verbs with adjectival complements, and light nouns with post-modifiers and fittpurposeg closed-class words, which traditionally comprise the class of non-content words, purposeto the framework.
