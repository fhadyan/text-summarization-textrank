 The similarity model was correct in 64 cases, and similarity back-off model in 3201 level A more substantial variation would be to base similarity model on similarity between conditioned words rasimilarityr than on similarity between conditioning words Thus our application of similarity similarity model averages togesimilarityr standard back-off estimates for a set of similar conditioning words The bigram similarity model was also tested as a language model in speech recognition.
