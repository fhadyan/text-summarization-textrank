 Compositionality is defined as the property that the meaning of a whole is a function of the meaning of its parts (cf24-25  Hence so is the function  enumerates all the equations (e Hence is effectively computable Also, notice that the proposition holds true for generalized computability, in the sense of  He does not define the word systematic except as being an antonym to idiosyncratic  But in this paper we restrict ourselves to the mathematics of cf. However it does work for smaller classes of functions as the following examples show Proof Compositional semantics is usually defined as a functional dependence of the meaning of an expression on the meanings of its parts 10 n+1 1 Hence,  Contradiction And there are many other semantics corresponding to all possible polynomials in and  The moral is that not only it is natural to restrict meaning functions to, say, polynomials, but to further restrict them IDIOMS (However, the precise semantics of the expression is not important at this point wall, and highseas is a composition of the meaning functions for high and seas COORDINATION Then: (A  Proof We now prove the second part, i The proof consists in observing that cannot be obtained as a Boolean polynomial (function)  In this section we discuss some of the most obvious issues, and propose some research possibilities in this area That is, we want semantics to encode some basic intuitions, e Clearly, this cannot always be the case For instance, it seems natural to map verbs into predicates and nouns into their arguments type raising for ellipsis, but at the same time constrain the grammars  Other constructions can express speech acts, various kind of conflict, etc hence creating rich sets of meanings that nouns denote sets of entities, and verbs denote relations between entities, and so on; in other words, we would like to have a compositional semantics that agrees with intuitions only by the  But there are other measures of complexity by approximating a finite language by an infinite one  (A slightly less general definition, e One of the referees has pointed out two other ideas First, there could be other more natural notions of systematicity, in cases when meanings are specified by means of constraint solving, as is implicit in unification-based formalisms, and even in Theorem 1, where meanings are extracted as solutions to equations This concept is full abstraction , i which can be viewed as a general constraint on cf. also and  The answer to this question is somewhat disturbing In that model there is no separate syntax, since constructions encode both form and meaning Each construction explicitly defines the meaning function taking the meanings of its subconstructions as arguments (Continuing the above mathematical analogy, we would say that the only mode of combination is substitution for an argument  Montague) have not been using arbitrary homomorphisms Thus a careful examination of their work should lead to some characterization of good homomorphisms; and this seems to be another interesting avenue of research In this paper we have shown the formal vacuity of the cf. principle Theorem 1 (and its corollaries) explain formally why the postulate of a homomorphism between syntax and semantics is not restrictive enough: the syntactic operator of concatenation  can be mapped into functional composition operating on functions that encode arbitrary semantics of an arbitrary language As we have seen in the examples, the presence of other operators does not change the result, because they can be treated as yet another letter of the alphabet, and one can still produce a homomorphism between syntax and semanticse non-arbitrary204-205 in  Furthermore, our results have implications for computational linguistics (they are briefly discussed in  Finally, the reader should note that one of the more bizarre consequences of Theorem 1 is that we do not have to start building compositional semantics for natural language beginning with assigning of the meanings to words ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We do not assume that concatenation is associative, that is (a b Intuitively, this means that we assign semantics to parse trees, and not to strings of words Let M be a set of meanings, and let for any , be the meaning of s , postulates the existence of a homomorphism from syntax to semantics  Since elements of Mcan be of any type, we do not automatically have , where is some operation on the meanings 1 being a function equal to 1 for all values) and in mathematical linguisticst of S There is more than one way of doing this by assuring , for all s in S (Theorem 1  THEOREM 1 Let A be an arbitrary alphabet Thus, although intuitively clear, the definition is not restrictive enough Let be an arbitrary function is partial Furthermore, ZFA is better suited as foundations for semantics of natural language than ZFC (  We need only one (but fundamental) theorem of ZFA: the solution lemma ( and which says any (well-formed) collection of equations that define sets has a unique solution We illustrate the power of the theorem by showing how to assign compositional semantics to idioms and to a very counterintuitive semantics of coordination (Section 4  That is, there is a unique collection of sets that satisfy them Similarly for (ii  Given a class of functions F, we say that the compositional semantics is systematic if the meaning function belongs to the class F a function Proof of Corollary 2 Let enumerate S We can create a big table specifying meaning values for all strings and their combinations Clearly, such a process defines the function f, but, intuitively, it is not a definition we would care much for Then there is a set of functions M and a unique map such that for all s, Proof Note that, as in Corollary 2, if a certain string does not belong to the language, we can assume that the corresponding value in this table is undefined; thus is not necessarily defined for all possible concatenations of strings of S Notice that requiring the computability of the meaning function will not do PROPOSITION 4 Proof.
