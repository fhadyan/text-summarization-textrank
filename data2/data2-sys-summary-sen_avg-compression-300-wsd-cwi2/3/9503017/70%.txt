 form and uh wants to give her some security  Harry's utterance of (20) is said with a falling intonational contour and hence is unlikely to be a question This is part of the CENTERING function of IRU's and is left to future work This section discusses assumption (3) of the determistic model, namely that: Agents are logically omniscient [c You cannot buy an I R A oh no oh i see well i did work i do work for a company that has a pension (17) h THEN YOU'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR EIGHTY ONE (18) j Utterance (17) selects eighty one, with a narrow focus pitch accent A subcase of ensuring that certain inferences get made involves the juxtaposition of two propositions form ( 7) j IT DOES45 per month ( 9) j take the money (10) h absolutely YOU'RE ONLY GETTING 1500 A YEAR ( 9) h SUPPORT is a general relation that holds between beliefs and intentions in this model Presumably Jane would have no trouble calculating that $125 I suggested that this assumption can be replaced by adopting a model in which agents' behavior provides evidence for whether or not mutual understanding has been achieved I also discussed some of the effects of resource bounds, ie YUP THAT KNOCKS HER OUT cases of ensuring that or providing evidence that certain inferences dependent on what is said are made Therefore it is important to distinguish an agent actually ACCEPTING the belief that p or intending to perform an action described by p from merely understanding that p was conveyed Other accounts legislate that helpful agents should adopt other's beliefs and intentions or that acceptance depends on whether or not the agent previously believed p ,  In standard information theoretic terms, both (8) and (9) are REDUNDANT Example 5: (38) h that's correct (41) r Example 6 (13) h WELL I THOUGHT THEY JUST STARTED THIS YEAR Joe's statement is based on his prior beliefs In both of these cases this evidence for conflict is given immediately Harry's assertion in (9) simply paraphrases what was said in (7) and (8) and so it cannot be adding beliefs to the common ground However when there is no evidence to the contrary, and goals of the discourse require achievement of acceptance, inferences about acceptance are licensed as default They can be defeated later by stronger evidence The result of this is that the retraction of that belief results in many beliefs being revised The first point to note is that the examples here are only a subset of the types of IRU's that occur in dialogues Of 171 IRU's, only 28 are realized with rising question intonation Finally, if it were a question it would seem that it should have more than one answer It seems an odd question that only has one answer The first point to note is that IRU's actually occur in dialogues that aren't on the radio  they are not random This can be based on analyzing when the information that is repeated has been specifically requested, such as in the caller's opening question or by a request for information from Harry make or keep a proposition salient  It should also be possible to test whether the IRU realizes a proposition that plays a role in the final plan that Harry and the caller negotiate It should be apparent from the account that the types of utterances examined here are not really redundant It also follows from (2) that these models assume that agents are not autonomous, or at least do not have control over their own mental states But belief revision is surely an autonomous process; agents can choose whether to accept a new belief or revise old beliefs ,  The occurrence of IRU's in dialogue has many ramifications for a model of dialogue Accounting for IRU's has two direct effects on a dialogue model This paper will focus on (1) leaving (2) for future work One function of IRU's is to address the assumptions on which mutual beliefs are based Second the assumption that propositions representing beliefs and intentions get added to the context by the unilateral action of one conversant must be dropped First consider the notion of evidence This is especially true when it comes to modelling the effects of linguistic actions Linguistic actions are different than physical actions An agent's prior beliefs, preferences and goals cannot be ascertained by direct inspection This means that it is difficult for the speaker to verify when an action has achieved its expected result, and so giving and receiving evidence is critical and the process of establishing mutual beliefs is carefully monitored by the conversants (4) The context of a discourse is an undifferentiated set of propositions with no specific relations between them Section discusses assumption (1 section shows how assumption (2) can be dropped; section discusses (3 section shows that some IRU's facilitate the inference of relations between adjacent propositions The account proposed here of how the COMMON GROUND is augmented, is based is Lewis's SHARED ENVIRONMENT model for common knowledge ,  indicates to everyone in P that everyone in P has reason to believe that holds indicates to everyone in P that  The situation , used above in the mutual belief induction schema, is the context of what has been said Mutual beliefs can be inferred based on some evidence, but these beliefs may depend on underlying assumptions that are easily defeasible This model can be implemented using Gallier's theory of autonomous belief revision and the corresponding system  This ordering reflects the relative defeasibility of different assumptions Augmenting the strength of an assumption thus decreases its relative defeasibility A claim of this paper is that one role of IRU's is to ensure that these assumptions are supported by evidence, thus decreasing the defeasibility of the mutual beliefs that depend on them  Thus mutual beliefs depend on a defeasible inference process All inferences depend on the evidence to support them, and stronger evidence can defeat weaker evidence So a mutual belief supported as an inference can get defeated by linguistic information This section examines the assumption from the DETERMINISTIC MODEL that: (2) Propositions representing beliefs and intentions get added to the context by the unilateral action of one conversant This assumption will also be examined in section  I adopt the assumption that the participants in a dialogue are trying to achieve some purpose  Some aspects of the structure of dialogue arises from the structure of these purposes and their relation to one another The minimal purpose of any dialogue is that an utterance be understood, and this goal is a prerequisite to achieving other goals in dialogue, such as commitment to future action I claim that a model of the achievement of mutual belief of understanding can be extended to the achievement of other goals in dialogue Inference of mutual understanding relies upon some evidence, e the utterance that is made, and a number of underlying assumptions The assumptions are given with the inference rule below The assumptions are that A and B were copresent, that B was attending to the utterance event, that B heard the utterance, and that B believes that the utterance u realizes the intended meaning p The [evidence-type] annotation indicates the strength of evidence supporting the assumption All of the assumptions start out supported by no evidence; their evidence type is therefore hypothesis It isn't until after the addressee's next action that an assumption can have its strength modified Examples are provided in sections and  It is also possible that A intends that BY saying u, which realizes p, B should make a certain inference q Then B's understanding of u should include B making this inference All that prompts such as uh huh do is provide evidence of attention However repetitions, paraphrases and making inferences explicit also demonstrate complete hearing In addition, a paraphrase and making an inference explicit provides linguistic evidence of what proposition the paraphraser believes the previous utterance realizes Explicit inferences additionally provide evidence of what inferences the inferrer believes the realized proposition licenses in this context In each case, the IRU addresses one or more assumptions that have to be made in order to infer that mutual understanding has actually been achieved a PARAPHRASE is stronger evidence of understanding than a REPEAT  Consider example 1 in section  Ray, in (8 repeats Harry's assertion from (7  This upgrades the evidence for the assumptions of hearing and attention associated with utterance (7) from hypothesis to linguistic.
