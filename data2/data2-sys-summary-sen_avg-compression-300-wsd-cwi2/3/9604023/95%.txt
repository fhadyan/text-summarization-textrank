 These principles are simply properties of trees Thus while universals in GB are properties of trees, in GPSG they tend to be properties of sets of trees But the accompanying loss of language-theoretic complexity results is unfortunate The nature of language-theoretic complexity hierarchies is to classify languages on the basis of their structural properties The languages in a class, for instance, will typically exhibit certain closure properties (e Finally, the fact that universal complexity classes have automata-theoretic characterizations means that results concerning the complexity of natural languages will have implications for the nature of the human language faculty In this way, generative grammar in concert with formal language theory offers insight into a deep aspect of human cognition syntactic processing on the basis of observable behavior the structural properties of human languages Thus the insights offered by formal language theory might actually be misleading in guiding theories of syntax Since GPSG is presumed to license (roughly) context-free languages, we are not concerned here with establishing language-theoretic complexity but rather with clarifying the linguistic theory expressed by GPSG.
