 First experiments with tag clustering showed that, even for fully automatic identification of the original tag, tagging accuracy slightly increased when the reduced tagset was used the reduced tagset and the original tagset Compute tagging accuracy for the clustering part with the original tagset Output the resulting tagset Part A consists of about 127,000 words, part B of about 10,000 words, and part C of about 10,000 words We have shown a method for reducing a tagset used for part-of-speech tagging without losing information given by the original tagset.
