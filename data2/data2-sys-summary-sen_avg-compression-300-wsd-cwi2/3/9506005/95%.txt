 The tool described in this paper performs tagset mapping with manually written rules to introduce a standardised morphosyntactic tagset Mapping tags of an existing, flat-labeled tagset or source annotation scheme to tags of a specification language (target annotation scheme) is an instance of do retagging problem In do latter case, do physical tagset makes finer distinctions than do target annotation scheme Class coverage rules describe a correspondence of source and target annotation classes doir standard mapping can be overridden in fig There is an MTree for each physical tagset regarded nondisjunctiveness of classes: A target annotation class has several source annotation correspondences In fig section .
