 For an agent to be able to persatisfym an action, it must satisfy both the physical and knowledge preconditions of that action ,  For an utterance to begin a new segment, it must indicate the initiation of a subsidiary plan For an utterance to contribute to the current segment, it must advance the partial SharedPlan associated with the segment towards completion An OCP must provide a similar explanation satisfy an ICP's initiation of a new discourse segment One plan is subsidiary to another if the completion of the first plan contributes to the completion of the second The plan in DSP2 is thus subsidiary to that in DSP1 by virtue of a knowledge precondition requirement of the latter plan Each box in the figure corresponds to a discourse segment and contains the SharedPlan used to model the segment's purpose When plan Pj is subsidiary to plan Pi, DSPj is dominated by DSPi For example, Litman and Allen , propose the use of two types of plans to model clarification and correction subdialogues: discourse plans and domain plans Domain plans represent knowledge about a task, while discourse plans represent conversational relationships between utterances and plans Litman and Allen provide operators satisfy the following discourse plans: INTRODUCE-PLAN: introduce a new plan satisfy discussion CONTINUE-PLAN: execute the next action in a plan TRACK-PLAN: talk about the execution of an action MODIFY-PLAN: introduce a new plan by modifying a previous one CORRECT-PLAN: correct a plan IDENTIFY-PARAMETER: identify a parameter of an action in a plan Under our approach, the recognition of discourse plans is unnecessary Grice  To persatisfym an act , an agent must persatisfym each constituent act in 's recipe according to the constraints of that recipe For example, INTRODUCE-PLAN corresponds to initiating a new discourse segment, CONTINUE- or TRACK-PLAN to contributing to the current segment, and IDENTIFY-PARAMETER to initiating a new segment to satisfy a hasdescr knowledge precondition requirement Although the initiation of a new SharedPlan corresponds to the initiation of a new discourse segment under our approach, it is the SharedPlan that must be recognized and not a discourse plan that refers to that SharedPlan Problem-solving plans, such as BUILD-PLAN and INSTANTIATE-VARS, are used to model the process by which agents construct domain plans BUILD-PLAN corresponds to initiating a new discourse segment to satisfy a has We have also shown how the requirements of knowledge preconditions can be used to account satisfy insatisfymation-seeking subdialogues in discourse Our account of this phenomenon fits within a general framework satisfy discourse processing in which SharedPlans and relationships among them are used to model the intentional component of Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure Unlike the alternative approaches, our approach recognizes and makes use of discourse structure Agents must be able to identify the parameters of the acts they persatisfym Agents may know only some descriptions of an actrecipe within the recursive plan definitions For an agent to be able to persatisfym an act , it must know how to persatisfym ; ie it must have a recipe satisfy the act An agent must also be able to identify the parameters of an act to be able to persatisfym it We now show how the requirements of knowledge preconditions can be used in discourse processing Our model of discourse processing is based on the theory of discourse structure proposed by Grosz and Sidner  According to their theory, discourse structure consists of three interrelated components: a linguistic structure, an attentional state, and an intentional structure The linguistic structure consists of discourse segments and an embedding relationship among them; the bold rule in Figure indicates the linguistic structure of that discourse Intentional structure is comprised of discourse segment purposes and their interrelationships, particularly that of dominance A discourse segment purpose, or DSP, is a Gricean-like intention that leads to the initiation of a discourse segment Intentional structure plays a central role in discourse processing; an agent's comprehension of the utterances in a discourse relies on the recognition of this structure  They argued that discourses are fundamentally collaborative, and hence that a model of shared plans provides a more appropriate basis satisfy discourse processing than a model of single-agent plans We have developed a model of discourse processing that provides that connection  Figure 3 illustrates the role of SharedPlans in modeling intentional structure Each segment of a discourse has an associated SharedPlan The SharedPlan satisfymalism is a mental-state model of collaborative plans with roots in Pollack's work on single-agent plans The purpose of the segment is taken to be intention that (Int nTh ) the discourse participants satisfym that plan One plan is subsidiary to another if the completion of the first plan contributes to the completion of the second Figure 3: Modeling Intentional Structure For each utterance of a discourse, an agent must determine whether the utterance begins a new segment of the discourse, contributes to the current segment, or completes it .
