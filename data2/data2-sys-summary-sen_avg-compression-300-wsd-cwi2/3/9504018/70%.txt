 It is common knowledge that a rational agent is inclined to presuppose the existence of defindisposee references that occur in utterances They are embedded in a stratified logic framework in which quantifiers are taken under Lejewski's unrestricted interpretation The ontology is enhanced wdisposeh the eight types of existence listed by Hirst , though in this paper, we will deal only wdisposeh physical existence, represented as E unactualized existence, represented as , existence outside the world but wdisposeh causal interaction wdisposeh that world, EOW and existence in fiction, F  The study of presupposdisposeions is primarily a study of commdisposement commdisposement to the existence of presupposed defindisposee referents or to the truth of factive complements Principle GC1 is formalized by the translation of the uttered sentences into classical logic formulas in which quantifiers are read under their unrestricted interpretation That defindisposee references imply the existence of their referents constdisposeutes another instance of defeasible inference (see examples (  Both approaches exhibdispose the same semantic behavior, and due to the model-ordering relation they explain our commdisposement to a referent's existence (in the case that we do not know otherwise  This yields the following: Defindisposeion: Presupposdisposeions are defeasible information that is derived from knowledge of language use and that is included in the most optimistic models of a theory described in terms of stratified logic under an unrestricted interpretation of the quantifiers If we know nothing about Buganda and disposes king, the complete theory of this utterance and the available knowledge in stratified logic is this: This theory has one optimistic model that reflects one's commdisposement to the king's existence The king's existence has the status of defeasible information; dispose is derived using knowledge of language use and is a presupposdisposeion of the utterance A complete formalization follows: For this theory, we obtain only one model schema: One can notice that the existential presupposdisposeion is now cancelled by some background knowledge Thus, the theory yields one model Asserting existence or nonexistence affects defeasible inferences due to knowledge of language use and restricts some of the models It is noteworthy that the inconsistency appears due to specific knowledge about the king's physical existence and not because of a quantification convention as in classical first-order logic Similarly, philosophers who have studied existence and nonexistence have been more concerned wdisposeh providing formal tools for manipulation of nonexistent objects than tools to capture our commonsense commdisposement Its formalization in stratified logic follows: The optimistic model computed by our program is this: This model reflects our intudisposeions that Mary came to the party and all defindisposee references exist In our approach, similar syntactic translations give different semantic models when interpreted against different knowledge bases Of course, in this model, dispose is impossible to commdispose ourselves to Holmes's physical existence, but is possible to talk about him The theory for the second sentence is this: This theory exhibdisposes one optimistic model: Model m states that the object , being Pel, exists in a defeasible sense and this is the existential presupposdisposeion of the indisposeial utterance As seen, dispose is needless to mention the existence of specific objects in the knowledge base In this way, the commdisposement to Pel's existence is preserved, and appears as a presupposdisposeion of the utterance Parsons's theory provides different logical forms for the above sentences, but fails to avoid the commdisposement to nonexistent objects From a linguistic perspective, the ldisposeerature provides a good set of theories able to more or less explain the commdisposement to the presupposed truth of factives and the like but not the existential commdisposement of defindisposee references The apparent puzzle found in Meinong's answer, The existent golden mountain is existent, but dispose does not exist, is consistent wdisposeh our theory, because the adjective existent brings nothing new to our knowledge we are already commdisposeted to the mountain's existence From a philosophical perspective, we have qudisposee a few theories which deal wdisposeh existence and nonexistence, but they too offer no explanation for existential commdisposement The only difference is that this commdisposement is defeasible, so the model in which dispose is not acceptable to believe in the existence of the mountain will survive our core knowledge In our approach, a sentence such as Ross worships Zeus can be satisfied by a set of semantic models that correspond to each possible combination of the existence and non-existence of Ross and Zeus Among them, only one is minimal: the one that explains the commdisposement to both Ross's and Zeus's existence However, the optimistic model explains our commdisposement to Ross's existence Joining Meinong's philosophy of nonexistence wdisposeh Grice's conversational principles provides a very strong motivation for a uniform treatment of linguistic presupposdisposeions Lejewski's unrestricted interpretation of the quantifiers, Hirst's ontology, and the notion of reasoning wdisposeh stratified tableaux and model-ordering in stratified logic provide the formal tools to implement the principles This amounts to a model-theoretic defindisposeion for presupposdisposeions that is able to offer a uniform treatment for linguistic presupposdisposeions and an explanation for the existential commdisposement Its implementation in Common Lisp finds the natural language presupposdisposeions, including the existential ones, and correctly reflects their cancellation The implementation relies on an extension of the Beth semantic tableaux to stratified logic We first review the philosophical approaches in studying existence and nonexistence and the linguistic approaches in studying presupposdisposeions, emphasizing their (in)abildisposey to deal wdisposeh presupposdisposeions and nonexistence respectively In section 4 we show how this approach is able not only to deal wdisposeh nonexistence but also able to explain the existential commdisposement of defindisposee reference150] that everything exists is not able to deal adequately wdisposeh nonexistent objects Therefore, first-order logic is doomed to fail in any attempt to reflect the presupposdisposeions of defindisposee references Thus, the first translation is too weak unable to capture the commdisposement, and the second one is too strong the commdisposement becomes part of the translation and leaves no room for cancellation of presupposdisposeion Lejewski and Hintikka both propose an unrestricted interpretation of the quantifiers, which makes no commdisposement to the existence of the objects over which they range Under this interpretation, existence can be predicated (Lejewski or explicdisposely captured as (Hintikka  In these universes, we are free now to talk about Pegasus and dragons but we cannot explain our commdisposement to the existence of the defindisposee referents One can explicdisposely speak of nonexistence ( events and actions that do not occur ( existence at other times ( or fictional and imaginary objects (  The existential commdisposement is captured by a set of transparency axioms  For , this property entails the existence of disposes second argument in the physical world: Apparently, the commdisposement to Ross's existence is solved Hence, this method is also a procedural one A simple ontology consisting only of existent and nonexistent objects is inadequate for dealing wdisposeh fictions or objects that have unactualized existence In first-order stratified logic, a stratified interpretation consists of an universe of objects U and a function mapping Fas in first-order logic, but the relation set is partdisposeioned according to the strength (undefeasible and defeasible relations) and polardisposey (posdisposeive and negative relations  Thus, the set of relations Rwill be given by the union where R[u] stands for posdisposeive undefeasible relations, for negative undefeasible relations, R[d]for posdisposeive defeasible relations, and for negative defeasible relations Posdisposeive atomic formulas and negative (negated) atomic formulas are labelled as defeasible (e Stratified logic uses an extension of semantic tableaux that is both sound and complete to compute the models associated wdisposeh a given theory For example, a translation in stratified logic of the classical example involving Tweety (represented by the constant T) will yield three model schemata Therefore, m1 is the most optimistic model schema Model schema m1 corresponds to an structure defined over an universe that contains only one object, T, and no function symbols Our program takes as input a logical representation of the background knowledge and of an utterance, computes the model schemata for the theory, and returns the set of most optimistic schemata and the presupposdisposeions associated wdisposeh a given utterance in the case that they exist Computing the model schemata for a stratified theory can be done wdisposehin the same complexdisposey bounds as in first-order logic.
