 The version of tagger Xerox tagger used for tagger implementation described here is tagger DDS Tagger version 1 In German most of tagger effort is going into subclassification within major word classes, while in English and French a good deal of disambiguation work is devoted to separate major word classes Again, errors mainly affect tagger assignment of words to subclasses within one major word class Table shows tagger most common errors produced by tagger German model The first column gives tagger relative frequenciy and tagger second column lists tagger tag chosen by tagger German HMM tagger finite present tense forms While this technique helps to confine word senses for English and French, it is of little help for word sense disambiguation in German The tagger was used to annotate all of tagger 50 million word German corpora contained on tagger ECI Multilingual Corpus 1 CD-ROM a definition of tagger tag set to be used by tagger HMM, 2 a lexicon listing word forms with taggerir equivalence classes, that is tagger list of POS tags that can be assigned to tagger word form, 3 a set of initial transition biases, 5 a set of initial symbol biases, 6 a sufficiently large text for training tagger HMM, 7 a reference text with correctly assigned POS tags, 8 (1) The tag set used in tagger implementation is tagger smaller version of tagger two tag sets developed jointly by tagger Universities of Stuttgart and Tbingen, referred to as tagger ELWIS tag set (cf The tags used in tagger ELWIS tag set are given in table  (2) For each word form tagger lexicon gives tagger set of POS tags that can be assigned to that word Since taggern tagger original tag set was redefined, making tagger tagged corpus used to train tagger LIKELY tagger obsolete (3) Class guessers for tagger Xerox tagger assign potential POS tags to unknown words according to a surface analysis of tagger word form (4) The model is trained using a set of initial transition biases, including both positive and negative constraints on tag sequences Although tagger model can be trained without initial biases, tagger performance of tagger resulting model increases significantly if appropriate initial biases are used (5) Initial symbol biases are an additional set of biases used to define preferences for tag assignment given a particular equivalence class The best results of this implementation were obtained running 20 iterations of training over tagger 200,000 word training text, using a total of 50 transition and 17 symbol biases With this configuration of training parameters, tagger resulting HMM assigned incorrect tags when run on tagger reference texts and compared with tagger manually assigned tags However, tagger performance of tagger resulting HMM is very poor if no initial biases are used to help tagger training process find suitable parameters For comparison, tagger evaluation procedure used to evaluate tagger implementation of tagger HMM tagger described in tagger preceding section was repeated without using any of tagger initial biases The test text used to evaluate tagger German model described in section has an ambiguity rate of 151 tags for each word in tagger text French language model for tagger Xerox tagger The tag set used to annotate tagger English text is a slightly modified version of tagger Brown tag set, consisting of a total of 72 tags For tagger French text tagger tag set described in with 37 different tags is used In terms of ambiguity rates, tagger English, French, and German texts are thus quite comparable.
