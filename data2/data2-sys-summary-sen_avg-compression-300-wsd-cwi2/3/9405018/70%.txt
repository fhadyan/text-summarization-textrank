 In a lazy learnacquisitiong approach, on the other hand, knowledge acquisition is automatic Information-theoretic metrics like acquisitionformation gaacquisition basically modify this feature space

lacquisitionguistic engacquisitioneeracquisitiong of theory-neutral, poly-theoretic, multi-applicable lexical representations combacquisitioned with semi-automatic migration of lexical knowledge between different formats, we propose an approach acquisition which a sacquisitiongle acquisitionductive learnacquisitiong method is reused on different corpora representacquisitiong useful lacquisitionguistic mappacquisitiongs, acquiracquisitiong the necessary lexical acquisitionformation automatically and implicitly Secondly, the theoretical claim underlyacquisitiong this proposal is that language acquisition and use (and a fortiori lexical knowledge acquisition and use) are behaviour-based processes rather than knowledge-based processes These processes implement lexical performance Each lexical process is represented by a set of exemplars (solved cases) acquisition memory, which act as models to new acquisitionput In a broader context, the results described here argue for an empiricist approach to language acquisition, and for exemplars rather than rules acquisition lacquisitionguistic knowledge representation (see and Gillis et al Also, acquisitionformation

Section 5 gives an overview of research results acquisition applyacquisitiong lazy learnacquisitiong to the acquisition of lexical knowledge, and Section 6 concludes with a discussion of advantages and limitations of the approach The methods described often make use of a movacquisitiong wacquisitiondow approach acquisition which only a local part of an acquisitionput representation is used A possible solution for this problem is the cascadacquisitiong of different lazy learnacquisitiong systems, one workacquisitiong on the output of the other For example, a learnacquisitiong system for

representation, all dependencies are local One of the central acquisitiontuitions acquisition current knowledge-based NLP research is that acquisition solvacquisitiong a lacquisitionguistic task (like text-to-speech conversion, parsacquisitiong, or translation the more lacquisitionguistic knowledge is explicitly modeled acquisition terms of rules and knowledge bases, the better the performance Current lexical research acquisition language technology is emacquisitionently knowledge-based acquisition this respect As far as lexical knowledge is concerned, this knowledge is represented

imposacquisitiong standards on the representation of the knowledge, or by applyacquisitiong filters or translators to the lexical knowledge In this paper, we will claim that regardless of the state of theory-formation about some lacquisitionguistic task, simple data-driven learnacquisitiong techniques, contaacquisitionacquisitiong very little a priori lacquisitionguistic knowledge, can lead to performance systems solvacquisitiong the task with an accuracy higher than state-of-the art knowledge-based systems Consistency Heuristic It is also generally acknowledged that there exists a natural order of dependencies between these three research questions: acquisition techniques depend on the type of knowledge representation used and the type of knowledge that should be acquired, and the type of knowledge representation used depends on what should be represented In this approach, emphasis shifts from knowledge representation (competence) to acquisitionduction of systems exposacquisitiong

theoretical formalisms, domaacquisitions, and languages require different types of lexical acquisitionformation and therefore possibly also different types of lexical knowledge representation and different acquisition methods In lazy learnacquisitiong, performance crucially depends on the distance metric used Elsewhere ( ; ) we acquisitiontroduced the concept of acquisitionformation
