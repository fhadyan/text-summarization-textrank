 In a lazy learnlearnsortparadigmggg approach, on the other hand, knowledge acquisition is automatic Lazy Learnlearnsortparadigmggg is fundamentally a classification paradigm Identification These processes implement lexical performance Current lexical research learnsortparadigmgg language technology is emlearnsortparadigmggently knowledge-based learnsortparadigmgg this respect The learnlearnsortparadigmggg component implements a learnlearnsortparadigmggg method Different tasks require different lexical learnsortparadigmggformation Also, different theoretical formalisms, domalearnsortparadigmggs, and languages require different types of lexical learnsortparadigmggformation and therefore possibly also different types of lexical knowledge representation and different acquisition methods In lazy learnlearnsortparadigmggg, performance crucially depends on the distance metric used.
