 Each elementary tree pair in the synchronous TAG corresponds to an elementary tree set in the MCTAG Figure shows the derivation tree pair schematically, including the nonisomorphism mapping between the trees This exclusion makes the definition of the derived tree for a given derivation tree determinate It should be obvious that such a synchronous derivation tree can be trivially restated as a pair of standard derivation trees, further simplifying the definition of synchronous TAG derivation This leads to the following definition of synchronous TAG derivation DL is a well-formed derivation tree relative to GL First, the derived tree pair for a derivation is .
