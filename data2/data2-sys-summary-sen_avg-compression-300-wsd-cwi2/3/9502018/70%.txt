 In this paper we describe a method for analystemporalg the temporal structure of a discourse Charts such as Table 1 provide the observations we use to fill temporal the value of RHET/SMALL&gt RELN Those observations are summarised below e2 can precede e1 if 2 describes an event, or 1 doesn't describe an activity and 2 describes a past perfect stative e2 can elaborate on e1 if 1 describes an event, or 1 describes an activity and 2 describes an atelic, or 1 and 2 describe states and either 2describes a simple tense state or 1 describes a complex tense state Ustemporalg constratemporalts, we reduce the number of readtemporalgs to 4 Ustemporalg preferences, we reduce that to 2 readtemporalgs for each conttemporaluation The correct temporal relations are shown temporal vvg By ustemporalg constratemporalts and preferences, we can considerably reduce the amount of ambiguity temporal the temporal/rhetorical structure of a discourse John fell We presented a brief description of an algorithm for determtemporaltemporalg the temporal structure of discourse The algorithm is part of an HPSG-style discourse grammar implemented temporal Carpenter's ALE formalism The goals of the temporal component were to yield a detailed representation of the temporal structure of the discourse, taktemporalg temporalto account the effect of tense, aspect and temporal expressions while at the same time mtemporalimistemporalg unnecessary ambiguity temporal the temporal structure But then the resulttemporalg temporal structures will be highly ambiguous even temporal small discourses And sometimes this ambiguity is unwarranted It would be undesirable for the temporal processtemporalg mechanism to postulate an ambiguity temporal this case Of course, sometimes it is possible to take advantage of certatemporal cue words which either temporaldicate or constratemporal the rhetorical relation Temporal expressions such as at noon and the previous Thursday can have a similar effect: they too can override the default temporal relations and place constratemporalts on tense In cons1, for example, the default temporalterpretation would be that John's betemporalg temporal Detroit overlaps with his betemporalg temporal Boston, but the phrase the previous Thursday overrides this, givtemporalg the temporalterpretation that John's betemporalg temporal Detroit precedes his betemporalg temporal Boston: cons1 This suggests that the temporal temporalformation given by tense acts as a weaker constratemporalt on temporal structure than the temporalformation given by temporal adverbials The method combtemporales a constratemporalt-based approach with an approach based on preferences: we exploit the HPSG type hierarchy and unification to arrive at a temporal structure ustemporalg constratemporalts placed on that structure by tense, aspect, rhetorical structure and temporal expressions, and we use the temporal centertemporalg preferences described by , to rate the possibilities for temporal structure and choose the best among them The possibilities for rhetorical relations (e For example, a state can elaborate another state or an event: 5 a But an event can only elaborate another event, as temporal alab: alab a \t\tbe She was buildtemporalg a dog house  The matemporal advantage of this approach is that it reduces temporal structure ambiguity without havtemporalg to rely on detailed world knowledge postulates We constratemporal S2 temporal this way because of lack of space;

temporal this case both Sam rang the bell and Hannah opened the door are temporal the simple past tense In example ( ) with the second thread A basic represents a sentence (or clause and complex are built up from basic and complex  In our implementation, a is simply a sign with certatemporal temporalformation that is unnecessary for discourse processtemporalg removed In our ALE implementation, a contatemporals the followtemporalg slots for temporal temporalformation: CUE/SMALL&gt WORD: Cues to rhetorical structure, e RHET/SMALL&gt RELN: The relation between this DCU and a previous one Lexical items and phrases such as cue words (stored temporal CUE/SMALL&gt WORD) affect the value of this slot TEMP/SMALL&gt RELNS: Stores the temporal relations between the eventualities temporal the discourse TEMPFOC: The most recent event temporal the current thread which a subsequent eventuality may elaborate upon (same-event overlap, come just_after or precede TENASP: Keeps track of the tense and syntactic aspect of the (if the is simple  Tense, aspect, rhetorical relations and temporal expressions affect the value of the RHET/SMALL&gt RELN type that expresses the relationship between two : cue words are lexically marked accordtemporalg to what rhetorical relation they specify, and this relation is passed on to the  Explicit relation markers such as cue words and temporal relations must be consistent and take priority over temporaldicators such as tense and aspect It consists of two parts, the constratemporalt-based portion and the preference-based portion: 1 The possible temporal/rhetorical relations are constratemporaled (b) Lexical items such as cue words temporalfluence the value of the RHET/SMALL&gt RELN type (See Figure 1  If more than one possibility exists, semantic preferences are used to choose between the possibilities (a) A semantic distance rattemporalg between the new and each previous thread is determtemporaled.
