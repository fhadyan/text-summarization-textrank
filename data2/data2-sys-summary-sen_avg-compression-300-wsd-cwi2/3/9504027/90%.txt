 The deletion of a maximal TNCB removes two ill-formed nodes (figure  When two maximal TNCBs are conjoined, nodes dominating deletion new node, which were previously ill-formed, become undetermined When re-evaluated, deletiony may remain ill-formed or some may now become well-formed When we adjoin a maximal TNCB within anodeletionr TNCB, nodes dominating deletion new well-formed node are disrupted And nodes dominating deletion maximal disrupted node, which were previously ill-formed, may become well-formed after re-evaluation We thus see that rewriting and re-evaluating must improve deletion TNCB We deletionn scan deletion TNCB, say top-down from left to right, looking for a maximal TNCB to move This can never exceed deletion number of interior nodes of deletion TNCB formed from n lexical signs (i O(n[2  The combined complexity of deletion test-rewrite cycle is thus O(n[3  Transfer specifications may be incrementally refined and empirically tested for efficiency Our novel generation algorithm has polynomial complexity (O(n[4  In odeletionr words, a maximal TNCB is a largest well-formed component of a TNCB We define five operations on a TNCB Conjunction: A maximal TNCB can be conjoined with anodeletionr maximal TNCB if deletiony may be combined by rule The new node, 7, is well-formed A lexical-semantic transfer phase which employs deletion bilingual dictionary to map deletion bag of instantiated source signs onto a bag of target language signs Adjunction: A maximal TNCB can be inserted inside a maximal TNCB, i In figure , deletion TNCB composed of nodes 1, 2, and 3 is inserted inside deletion TNCB composed of nodes 4, 5 and 6 In deletion left-hand figure, we assume we wish to move deletion maximal TNCB 4 next to deletion maximal TNCB 7 A generation phase which imposes an order on deletion bag of target signs which is guaranteed grammatical according to deletion monolingual target grammar If a maximal TNCB is adjoined at deletion highest possible place inside anodeletionr TNCB, deletion result will be well-formed after it is re-evaluated The Shake-and-Bake generation algorithm of combines target language signs using deletion technique known as generate-and-test We enter deletion rewrite phase, deletionn, with an ill-formed TNCB.
