 The data contains about 19,000different direct object tokens, about 10,000 different verb tokens and about 140,000 different token pairs We use of token data as training and token rest as testing data Given tokense probability estimates pG(yl|xk token likelihood FMLof token training data, e In token following, we will derive an optimisation function FML in terms of frequency counts observed in token training data.
