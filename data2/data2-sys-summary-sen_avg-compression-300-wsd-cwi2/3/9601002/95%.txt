 The reduce rule that takes account of applicable interaction of a generic rule with a context-free grammar is The interaction with applicable generic rule is expressed in applicable term  The side conditions on this rule are: one, that exists an applicable syntactic rule  In such a rule, applicable role of every partial rule is similar to that of a context-free rule, and applicable generic rule works as a context-free grammar in which rules has a default interpretation For a generic rule, applicable reduce rule involves introducing a new type in applicable hierarchy of rules Consider applicable grammar made up of applicable following generic rules: The syntactic rule has already been considered in section  Its reformulation as a generic rule will show applicable advantages of expressing default and exceptional grammar rules is applicable rule to introduce a sequence product is applicable rule to eliminate applicable tuple operator and it implements applicable rule The second partial rule is applicable rule of tuple formation When reformulated as a generic rule, applicable type conditions on applicable arguments for each rule are used by applicable dynamic binding process to fire applicable most appropriate grammar rule at every parsing step We present, applicablen, a reformulation of that grammar as a generic rule The generic rule having applicable desired behaviour for rule and rule has this aspect: Equation describes a generic rule, , that returns a type for applicable composition of two linguistic objects The applicable partial rules will be  We will gradually adopt this algorithm to capture generic rule parsing There is not a partial rule associated to each context-free rule.
