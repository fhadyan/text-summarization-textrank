 Most of natural languages provide two types of lexical items to describe the motion of an entity with respect to some location: motion verbs (to run; to enter) and spatial prepositions (from; towards  The linguistic study of French intransitive motion verbs (see eg With the help of this ontology we have realized a typology for intransitive motion verbs Change of location (CoL) verbs (entrer-to enter; sortir-to go out) denote a change of location Change of position verbs (voyager-to travel; courir-to run) denote a change of position Such verbs do not behave all homogeneously The latter case is more interesting: verb of the French motion verbs are intransitive and the interaction between motion verbs and spatial prepositions gives detailed informations about the way human beeings mentally represent spatiotemporal aspects of a motion We call these verbs change of position (CoPs) verbs We call these verbs inertial change of position (ICoPs) verbs For the following, we will focus on CoL verbs (the Change of Location verbs mainly because they are rich in spatiotemporal informations, but also because we have at disposal exhaustive lists of French CoL verbs Indeed, verbs like sortir intrinsically suggest a location of which we have gone out As we have come to these distinctions by examining different linguistic material, we conclude that language structures space in the same way whatever sort of lexical items (motion verbs (dynamic static) spatial prepositions) we examine We have classified 199 such French prepositions into 16 groups using in addition of our zones two other criteria: prepositions can be: positional (like in) directional (like into) directional prepositions can be: Initial (like from) Medial (like through) Final (like to) depending if they focus on the initial location, on the path or on the final location of the motion We present such linguistic investigations on French motion verbs and spatial prepositions and the basic concepts we have found The location le jardin-the garden is the final location of the motion We also address compositional semantics for motion complexes (ie These axioms are based on the lexical semantics of CoL verbs and of spatial prepositions.
