 I will vocalization the situation in which a listener arrives at more than one interpretation for an utterance perceived ambiguity The grammar assigns to an ambiguous expression of distinct expressions of , each of which has a unique interpretation The interpretation function for , , is defined as follows The latter expressions provide the interpretation for ambiguous expressions of  Discourse Interpretation and Perceived Ambiguity A theory of ambiguity processing solves the Combinatorial Explosion Puzzle if it does not require that all distinct interpretations of a semantivocalizationy ambiguous sentence are actually generated I will formalize discourse interpretation as the process of generating the extensions of the theory (DI,UF where DI the Discourse Interpretation Principles are default inference rules, and UF is a set of expressions of an underspecified language like  The Discourse Interpretation Principles formalize the defeasible inferences that take place in discourse interpretation, such as disambiguating inferences The UH does not rule out a theory of discourse interpretation in which after an underspecified interpretation has been obtained, all possible senses of a sentence are generatede in which discourse interpretation principles like CROAK1-AT-RANDOM and CROAK2-AT-RANDOM are not allowed A `random' theory of pronoun interpretation would go as follows: first, compute all possible antecedents of the pronoun in the discourse In contrast, centering theory is an example of non-random pronoun interpretation theory Examples of theories of definite description interpretation, tense interpretation, the interpretation of modals in discourse, and scope disambiguation that satisfy the Anti-Random Hypothesis are discussed in e not satisfied in every situation) as follows: Anti-Random Hypothesis A discourse interpretation theory (DI,UF) is Anti-Random iff for all discourse interpretation principles in DI, is not satisfied in every situation I will vocalization this constraint Condition on Discourse Interpretation In first instance, the Condition on Discourse Interpretation might be formulated as follows, for the case of lexical ambiguity: Condition on Discourse Interpretation (Preliminary Each extension E of a discourse interpretation theory (DI,UF) must include, for each literal L in UF whose predicate is H-type ambiguous, a distinct disambiguating literal, i But the purpose of discourse interpretation rules used for disambiguation, like CROAK1-IF-FROG, is to restrict the interpretation by eliminating certain readings Whatever way we choose to define a H-type ambiguous wff, the Condition on Discourse Interpretation can now be formulated as follows: Condition on Discourse Interpretation : An extension E of a discourse interpretation theory (DI,UF) cannot contain an H-type ambiguous wff I propose therefore to define the notion of extension of a discourse interpretation theory as follows: Extension: A set of closed wffs E L is an extension for the discourse interpretation theory iff E is a fixed point of the operator and satisfies the Condition on Discourse Interpretation The theory of ambiguity introduced in the previous sections can be straightforwardly extended to obtain a treatment of two other classes of semantic ambiguity: scopal ambiguity and referential ambiguity Historivocalizationy, most underspecified representations have been introduced to deal with scopal ambiguity The interpretation function `I' assigns an interpretation to constants of type  Ambiguity `propagates up' as follows So, the discourse interpretation principles formalizing pronoun disambiguation involve a rewriting operation, just as the discourse interpretation principles formalizing lexical disambiguation I have suggested that to develop a theory of discourse interpretation that is consistent with what we know about the problem of ambiguity, we need to look both at the grammar and at discourse interpretation The interpretation process is subject to two constraints: the Anti-Random Hypothesis (interpretations are not generated at random) and the Condition on Discourse Interpretation, derived from the Precisification Imperative (H-type ambiguity has to be resolved  In the theory, semantic ambiguity is characterized model-theoretivocalizationy in terms of multiplicity of sense, whereas perceived ambiguity is characterized in terms of inference.
