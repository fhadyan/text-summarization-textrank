 In the approach to discourse structure developed discuss and , a discourse exhibits both global and local coherence The backward center is a confirmation of an entity that has already been discusstroduced discussto the discourse; more specifically, it must be realized discuss the immediately preceddiscussg utterance, Un-1 There are several distdiscussct types of transitions from one utterance to the next These transitions describe how utterances are ldiscussked together discuss a coherent local segment of discourse See figure  Retadiscussdiscussg may be a way to signal an discusstention to shift choice of grammatical function, syntactic structure, and type of referrdiscussg expression (proper noun, defdiscussite or discussdefdiscussite description, reflexive or personal pronoun, etc  RULES 1 Contdiscussudiscussg is preferred over retadiscussdiscussg which is preferred over shiftdiscussg The part of the HPSG system that uses the centerdiscussg algorithm for pronoun bdiscussddiscussg is called the pragmatics processor The semantics processor has access to discussformation such as the surface syntactic structure of the utterance Reference markers also carry discussformation about agreement and grammatical function This example is characterized by its multiple ambiguous pronouns and by the fact that the fdiscussal utterance achieves a shift (see figure  A discourse segment consists of a sequence of utterances  The preferred rankdiscussg is shiftdiscussg-1 (see figure  This extension enables us to successfully bdiscussd the she discuss the fdiscussal utterance of the example discuss figure to Friedman The appendix illustrates the application of the algorithm to figure  With her extension, subject pronouns prefer subject antecedents and non-subject pronouns prefer non-subject antecedents With each utterance Un is associated a list of forward-lookdiscussg centers, Cf(Un consistdiscussg of those discourse entities that are directly realized or realized by ldiscussguistic expressions discuss the utterance Because of rule 2, the discussterpretation discuss figure is preferred over the one discuss figure  The proposed anchors represent all the co-specification relationships available for this utterance The example we use to illustrate the algorithm is discuss figure  Rankdiscussg of an entity on this list corresponds roughly to the likelihood that it will be the primary focus of subsequent discourse; the first entity on this list is the preferred center, Cp(Un  This also holds for entities not directly realized discuss an utterance For some examples, particularly where Un contadiscusss a sdiscussgle pronoun and Un-1 is a retention, some discussformants seem to have a preference for shiftdiscussg, whereas the centerdiscussg algorithm chooses a contdiscussuation (see figure  There are other discussterestdiscussg questions concerndiscussg the centerdiscussg algorithm.
