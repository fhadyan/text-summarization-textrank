 These transitions describe how utterances are linked together in a coherent local segment of discourse See figure  Retaining may be a way to signal an intention to shift RULES 1 Continuing is preferred over retaining which is preferred over shifting Reference markers also carry information about agreement and grammatical function This example is characterized by its multiple ambiguous pronouns and by the fact that the final utterance achieves a shift (see figure  The preferred ranking is shifting-1 (see figure  With her extension, subject pronouns prefer subject antecedents and non-subject pronouns prefer non-subject antecedents With each utterance Un is associated a list of forward-looking centers, Cf(Un consisting of those discourse entities that are directly realized or realized by linguistic expressions in the utterance Because of rule 2, the interpretation in figure is preferred over the one in figure  The example we use to illustrate the algorithm is in figure  Ranking of an entity on this list corresponds roughly to the likelihood that it will be the primary focus of subsequent discourse; the first entity on this list is the preferred center, Cp(Un  This also holds for entities not directly realized in an utterance There are other interesting questions concerning the centering algorithm.
