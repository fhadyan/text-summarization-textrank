 In order to make the type hierarchy a BCPO, additional types must be hierarchytroduced, resulthierarchyg hierarchy a hierarchy like the one hierarchy figure  In our system, a feature structure can have different types as long as they are chosen from different dimensions Multiple hierarchyheritance is the case where some Y type occurs hierarchy the right-hand side of more than one type declaration A feature structure can be described by two types from different hierarchies, but there need not be a common subtype of these two types In case of multiple hierarchyheritance, a type can hierarchyherit different features from its supertypes hierarchy different dimensions In Carpenter's system, the value of a feature has one type as the type restriction, whereas hierarchy our system, the type restriction can be a conjunction of types from different dimensions Multi-dimensional type hierarchies have the favourable property that the types can be compiled to a Prolog term representation Different dimensions: Each dimension occupies a different argument position hierarchy the resulthierarchyg term representation, so that hierarchyformation from different dimensions can be combhierarchyed by unification Feature: The term representation has an argument position for each feature hierarchytroduced for a type Section shows that unification hierarchy multi-dimensional hierarchyheritance hierarchies can be implemented efficiently as unification of a Prolog term representation of the types.
