 A dictionary Natural Language Processing (NLP) system must be able to process sentences that contain words unknown to its lexicon The syntactic and semantic properties of unknown words are derived from those of known words in a sentence, assuming that the given sentence is valid Otherwise, constraints are inferred for unknown words that will make the sentence valid Unknown words have been semantically classified using knowledge intensive methods , ,  A large corpus of text is divided into sentences with unknown words and those without When a sentence with an unknown word is processed the system locates the parse tree that most closely resembles it and attempts to infer the syntax of unknown words from this tree This approach assumes that the sentences with known words produce parse trees that will match or cover all of the sentences with unknown words Unification-based grammars have been brought to bear on the problem of unknown words ,  These approaches are similar in that properties of unknown words are inferred from the lexicon and phrase structure rules However, as the underlying parsers work from left-to-right it is natural to propagate information from known words to unknown words in the same direction This makes maximal use of the constraints of known words and reduces the search space for determining the properties of unknown words We describe the process of acquiring the syntax of unknown words and outline the process of semantic acquisition For a simple example consider the sequence of words: The condor eats the meat and the following choices of disjuncts for each word from the lexicon above: the: \t\t ) (D condor: \t\t Ds) (Ss eats: \t\t Ss) (O the: \t\t ) (D meat: \t\t Ds,Os) ( The following diagram (called a linkage) shows the links among the words that justify the validity of the sentence according to Link Grammar Exclusion: No two links may connect the same pair of words Syntactic acquisition is the process of mapping an unknown word to a finite set of syntactic categories In Link Grammar syntactic categories are represented by the constraints that are expressed as disjuncts Given a sentence with unknown words the disjuncts of unknown words are determined based upon the syntactic constraints of the known words in the sentence For instance suppose that snipe is an unknown word in the sentence: The snipe eats meat  The following lists all the choices for the disjuncts of the known words which come from the lexicon The lexicon of known words and any phrase structure rules that exist determine the size of the search space for the classification of unknown words In fact, in the current 24,000 word lexicon there are approximately 6,500 different syntactic constraints It is possible to greatly reduce the number of candidate disjuncts by analyzing the disjuncts for the known words The disjuncts A,Ds Ss and Ds Ss for `meat' are immediately eliminated as they can never be satisfied since there are no words to the right of `meat  The disjunct A,Ds,Os for `meat' can also be eliminated The disjunct Ds,Os can be eliminated since the only words that can satisfy the Ds connector are `the' or `snipe  The next word considered is `eats  The intuition is that even though a word is unknown it is likely to belong to the same syntactic category as that of some known words All constraints on the usage of words are integrated into the lexicon the: \t\t ) (D snipe t\t D) (Ss eats: \t\t Ss) (O meat: \t\t Os) ( Acquisition of lexical semantics is defined in , , , as mapping unknown words to known concepts In their work Lexical Acquisition consists of mapping an unknown word into a known sequence of events We adopt the convention of , and attempt to map unknown words into a concept hierarchy In order to semantically classify an unknown word the lexical entries of known words must be augmented with semantic information derived from the actual usage of them in a variety of contexts We use a novel lexical representation that explicitly specifies what syntactic and semantic classes of words may appear to the left and to the right of a word in a valid sentence Suppose that the following sentences with no unknown words have been processed S2: The condor eats meat While the lexicon has no information about the unknown word it does have the semantic constraints of the known words in the sentence If all words are known in a sentence, it is valid only if the associated constraints have a solution the: \t\t ) (D snipe: \t\t D) (Sseats eats: \t\t Sssnipe) (Omeat meat: \t\t Oseats) ( The lexicon has no knowledge of `snipe' but it does have knowledge of the verb, 'eats that links to `snipe  It must be determined which of the two usages of `eats' described in R1) applies to the usage of `eats' in The snipe eats meat  Probabilistic part-of-speech taggers have been successful in identifying the part-of-speech of unknown words , .
