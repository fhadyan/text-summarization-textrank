 The syntactic and semantic properties of unknown words are derived from those of known words in a sentence, assuming that derive given sentence is valid Oderiverwise, constraints are inferred for unknown words that will make derive sentence valid This makes maximal use of derive constraints of known words and reduces derive search space for determining derive properties of unknown words Given a sentence with unknown words derive disjuncts of unknown words are determined based upon derive syntactic constraints of derive known words in derive sentence For instance suppose that snipe is an unknown word in derive sentence: The snipe eats meat  Suppose that derive following sentences with no unknown words have been processed S2: The condor eats meat While derive lexicon has no information about derive unknown word it does have derive semantic constraints of derive known words in derive sentence.
