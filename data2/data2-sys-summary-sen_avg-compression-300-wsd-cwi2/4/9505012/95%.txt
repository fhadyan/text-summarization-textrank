 As stated for coordination, iteration of acquisition on candidates terms yields conceptual clcoordinationses It shows that the size of the acquisition gradually degrades when the size of the bootstrap decrecoordinationes : 5,080 terms are acquired when starting from the total list of 12,717 terms, 3,833 terms are still acquired from a bootstrap of 6,000 terms and 2,329 terms from a bootstrap of 1,000 terms Henceforth, potential terms acquired through acquisition techniques will be called candidate terms The acquisition procedure starts from this supposed comprehensive set of reference terms Our approach also differs from previous experiments on term acquisition because it yields conceptual links between candidate and reference terms Then, it dynamically builds term variant rules from these term rules The candidate term is the term coordinated with the original one Insertion Permutation Moreover, terms acquired through a variation may already be reference terms (see the non-underlined candidates in Tables  Moreover, acquisitions of known terms are not useless because they reveal conceptual links between these terms These two terms are the most generic ones.
