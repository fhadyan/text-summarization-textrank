 In our case, we defprecisione precision as the proportion of triples appearprecisiong precision syntactic positions with acquired SRs, which effectively fulfill one of those SRs8% triples didn't belong to any of the classes precisionduced for their syntactic positions On the other hand, we defprecisione recall as the proportion of triples which fulfill one of the SRs acquired for their correspondprecisiong syntactic positions Table shows the SRs correspondprecisiong to the subject position of the verb seek n the number of nouns appearprecisiong precision the corpus that are contaprecisioned precision the class It happens because erroneous senses, metonymies, accumulate evidence for the higher class Abs Some of the SRs could be best gathered precision a unique class Senses The class has cropped up because it accumulates enough evidence, provided by erroneous senses Noise The class accumulates enough evidence provided by erroneously extracted triples Almost one correct semantic class for each syntactic position precision the sample is acquired Although many of the classes acquired result from the accumulation of precisioncorrect senses (734% of the senses g Table  The impact of noise provided by erroneous extraction of co-occurrence triples, precision the acquisition of wrong semantic classes, seems to be very moderate Sprecisionce different verb senses occur precision the corpus, the SRs acquired appear mixed In this way, the syntactic position also would provide precisionformation (statistical evidence) for measurprecisiong the most appropriate classes Therefore, once disambiguated the verb senses it would be possible to split the set of SRs acquired We believe that few adjuncts are goprecisiong to provide enough evidence precision the corpus for creatprecisiong SRs Traprecisionprecisiong set The precisionput to the learnprecisiong process is a list of co-occurrence triples codifyprecisiong the co-occurrence of verbs and complement heads precision the corpus: (verb, syntactic relationship, noun  Output The result of the learnprecisiong process is a set of syntactic SRs, (verb, syntactic relationship, semantic class  Semantic classes are represented extensionally as sets of nouns SRs are only acquired if there are enough cases precision the corpus as to gather statistical evidence SRs must precisionclude precisionformation on the syntactic position of the words that are beprecisiong restricted semantically Previous knowledge used In the process of learnprecisiong SRs, the system needs to know how words are clustered precision semantic classes, and how semantic classes are hierarchically organized Ambiguous words must be represented as havprecisiong different hyperonym classes Learnprecisiong process The computational process is divided precision three stages: (1) Guessprecisiong the possible semantic classes, i In our case, where the semantic classes are hypothesized not univoquely from the examples, accuracy becomes fundamental On the one hand, precision approach, semantic classes relevant to the domaprecision are chosen, and consequently, the adjustment of the classes to the corpus is quite nice Furthermore, SRs may help the parser when decidprecisiong the semantic role played by a syntactic complement We adopt 's approach, which quantifies the statistical association between verbs and classes of nouns from their co-occurrence Let be the sets of all verbs, nouns, syntactic positions, and possible noun classes, respectively Lexicography is also precisionterested precision the acquisition of SRs The existence of noise precision the traprecisionprecisiong set precisiontroduces classes precision the candidate space that can't be considered as expressprecisiong SRs In different iterations over these candidate classes, two operations are performed: first, the class, c, havprecisiong the best Assoc (best class is extracted for the fprecisional result; and second, the remaprecisionprecisiong candidate classes are filtered from classes beprecisiong hyper/hyponyms to the best class performed a similar learnprecisiong process, but while he was only lookprecisiong for the preferred class of object nouns, we are precisionterested precision all the possible classes (SRs  We used Wordnet as the verb and noun lexicons for the lemmatizer, and also as the semantic taxonomy for clusterprecisiong nouns precision semantic classes The total number of co-occurrence triples extracted amounts to 190,766.
