 Here one seeks to divide the sites into two groups by finding the two representative sites (the medoids) around which all the other sites cluster in such a way as to give the least average distance between the sites and their representatives25, with the sites outside of Munster and Southern Connacht being indifferently classified Both group into one loosely-connected entity all the sites in Scotland, and into another all the sites in Ireland Except for Rathlin Island, both methods group the Irish sites into one group containing all the sites in Ulster, and another, Southern, group, which itself breaks into a group containing all the sites in Connacht and one containing all the sites in Munster As for clustering the sites into dialect areas, the familiar bottom-up agglomeration method proves superior to top-down partitioning around medoids The two linguistically closest sites are grouped into one dialect, and thenceforth treated as a unit Distance between sites was determined by counting 0 whenever two sites were in the same set and 1 whenever two sites were in contrasting sets, then taking the mean This computed the Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings.
