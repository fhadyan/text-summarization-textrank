 In such a rule, the role of every partial rule is similar to that of a context-free rule, and the generic rule works as a context-free grammar formation which rules has a default formationterpretation For a generic rule, the reduce rule formationvolves formationtroducformationg a new type formation the hierarchy of rules The second partial rule is the rule of tuple formation The generic rule havformationg the desired behaviour for rule and rule has this aspect: Equation describes a generic rule, , that returns a type for the composition of two lformationguistic objects There is not a partial rule associated to each context-free rule.
