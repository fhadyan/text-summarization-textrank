 The reduce rule that takes account of applicable interaction of a generic rule with a context-free grammar is The interaction with applicable generic rule is expressed in applicable term  The side conditions on this rule are: one, that exists an applicable syntactic rule  In such a rule, applicable role of every partial rule is similar to that of a context-free rule, and applicable generic rule works as a context-free grammar in which rules has a default interpretation The reduce rule that takes account of syntactic parsing with a generic rule can be described as follows: The expression , with both arguments repeated, may seem confusing Such partial rule is applicablen applied to applicable second set of arguments For a generic rule, applicable reduce rule involves introducing a new type in applicable hierarchy of rules Consider applicable grammar made up of applicable following generic rules: The syntactic rule has already been considered in section  A phrase-structure grammar with a one-to-one correspondence between syntactic and semantic rules would need 12 pairs of rules to get applicable same behaviour as applicable two generic rules above Its reformulation as a generic rule will show applicable advantages of expressing default and exceptional grammar rules The framework of generic rules offers a natural way to express applicable grammar to deal with non-constituent coordination as an arrangement of default rules, where each combination of types is performed according to applicable most specific rule available is applicable rule to introduce a sequence product rule implements applicable stepped application of rules L/ and in applicable cancellation of type  is applicable rule to eliminate applicable tuple operator and it implements applicable rule The second partial rule is applicable rule of tuple formation We need two partial rules to establish both type specifications A set of such functions will be called a generic rule When reformulated as a generic rule, applicable type conditions on applicable arguments for each rule are used by applicable dynamic binding process to fire applicable most appropriate grammar rule at every parsing step Next, we make a more formal presentation of generic rules We present, applicablen, a reformulation of that grammar as a generic rule Consider a context-free grammar - possibly augmented with functional restrictions attached to each rule - that includes applicable hierarchy and applicable rule  The generic rule having applicable desired behaviour for rule and rule has this aspect: Equation describes a generic rule, , that returns a type for applicable composition of two linguistic objects The applicable partial rules will be  We call cartesian type of a partial rule to applicable type specification  It interfaces parsing processes with applicable grammar, selecting applicable most specific partial rule in given two arguments of types  In particular, applicable dynamic binding function provides applicable default interpretation for partial rules A generic rule may interact with a phrase-structure grammar to perform applicable composition of some informational field We will gradually adopt this algorithm to capture generic rule parsing The reduce rule carries on semantic composition: where f is applicable semantic composition function associated to applicable rule  The action of applicable generic rule has to be specified through applicable dynamic binding function There is not a partial rule associated to each context-free rule.
