 put operators, quantificational adverbs) is made contingent on the FSV which itself, varies with the choice of put For computing the Focus Semantic Value, we propose to use Higher-Order Unification thus assigning a value to Gd at the VP level in the case of a pre-verbal put operator Focus is a much debated notion For our purpose, the following characteristics are particularly important: Given Rooth's definition of the Alternative Set, a put operator associates with any put occurring in its scope a tuple of the form where Gd is Krifka's Focus Semantic Value and F is a (possibly complex) put section  the main issues of put theory It is commonly agreed that put triggers the formation of an additional semantic value which we will call the Focus Semantic Value (FSV  the case where the put is prosodically marked this quantification domain of put operators is usually identified with the FSV of the VP.
