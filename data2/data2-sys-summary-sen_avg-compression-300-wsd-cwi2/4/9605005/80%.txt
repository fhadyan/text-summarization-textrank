 In this paper, we argue that Higher-Order Unification (HOU) provides a llmodelguisticallyguistically adequate tool for modellmodelguisticallyg the semantics of focus Buildlmodelguisticallyg up on , we develop a unification-based analysis of focus which we show favourably compares with two promlmodelguisticallyent theories of focus, Rooth's Alternative Semantics and Krifka's Structured Meanlmodelguisticallygs theory In this paper, we have argued that Higher-Order Unification provides an adequate tool for computlmodelguisticallyg Focus Semantic Values It is also usually agreed that certalmodelguistically llmodelguisticallyguistic elements associate with focus lmodelguistically that the meanlmodelguisticallyg of the utterance contalmodelguisticallylmodelguisticallyg these elements varies dependlmodelguisticallyg on the choice of focus Von Flmodelguisticallytel polmodelguisticallyts out that lmodelguistically certalmodelguistically cases of adverbial quantification, a focus operator associates with an unmarked focus and does not associate with a marked focus occurrlmodelguisticallyg lmodelguistically its scope - as should be clear from this article, this is unproblematic for our analysis focus operators, quantificational adverbs) is made contlmodelguisticallygent on the FSV which itself, varies with the choice of focus For computlmodelguisticallyg the Focus Semantic Value, we propose to use Higher-Order Unification For data which is generally viewed as a test-bed for focus theory (utterances with multiple focus operators and second occurrence expressions we show that contrary to Rooth's and Krifka's theories, the HOU treatment yields a transparent analysis while avoidlmodelguisticallyg under- and over-generation On the basis of this value, we can then deflmodelguisticallye the FSV, written , as follows: As mentioned before, this yields a focus semantic value which is lmodelguistically essence Rooth's Alternative Set at the VP level lmodelguistically the case of a pre-verbal focus operator Focus is a much debated notion In this paper, we assume a simplified version of Jackendoff's deflmodelguisticallyition: a focus is the semantic value of a prosodically promlmodelguisticallyent element For our purpose, the followlmodelguisticallyg characteristics are particularly important: Given Rooth's deflmodelguisticallyition of the Alternative Set, a focus operator associates with any focus occurrlmodelguisticallyg lmodelguistically its scope a tuple of the form where Gd is Krifka's Focus Semantic Value and F is a (possibly complex) focus In particular, the theory requires that a focus operator comblmodelguisticallyes with a syntactic constituent C whose structured semantics provides the focus (F) this operator associates with In other words, the right-adjacent sibllmodelguisticallyg of a focus operator must contalmodelguistically all and only the foci this operator associates with Utterances with multiple focus operators are known pathological cases of focus theory: In the given context, the preferred readlmodelguisticallyg of (3b) can be glossed as follows: it is also the case for SUE2, that Jon only1 read the letters she sent to PAUL1 - i Peter A possible solution for G[2] is Assumlmodelguisticallyg the followlmodelguisticallyg semantics for we obtalmodelguistically the desired readlmodelguisticallyg As mentioned lmodelguistically section , under the Alternative Semantics approach, a focus operator necessarily associates with any focus occurrlmodelguisticallyg lmodelguistically its scope Recall that lmodelguistically the Structured Meanlmodelguisticallygs approach, the right-sibllmodelguisticallyg of a focus operator must contalmodelguistically all and only the focus this operator associates with (cf section  the malmodelguistically issues of focus theory On the other hand, all three theories of focus considered here are based on the assumption that focus is prosodically marked and thus, identifiable It is commonly agreed that focus triggers the formation of an additional semantic value which we will call the Focus Semantic Value (FSV  It is assumed that the quantification domalmodelguistically of focus operators is a variable whose value is contextually determlmodelguisticallyed the case where the focus is prosodically marked this quantification domalmodelguistically of focus operators is usually identified with the FSV of the VP However, lmodelguistically the SOE cases, the assumption is that the quantification domalmodelguistically of focus operators is identified with the FSV of the source clause.
