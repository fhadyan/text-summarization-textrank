 The proposed procedure is based on successive calls to epanaphora anaphora module and to epanaphora PP attachment module To summarize epanaphora algorithm is: 1) Apply epanaphora anaphora module firstg (Carter, 1986; Reinhart, 1983; Sidner, 1983  2) Apply epanaphora PP attachment procedure 3) If some anaphora are left unresolved, apply epanaphora anaphora module again In this case epanaphora anaphora module can be applied before epanaphora attachment procedure The attachment of both PPs is epanaphoran skipped The anaphora module pertains to epanaphora recent methods, uses a set of resolution rules based on epanaphora focusing approach, see (Sidner, 1983 .
