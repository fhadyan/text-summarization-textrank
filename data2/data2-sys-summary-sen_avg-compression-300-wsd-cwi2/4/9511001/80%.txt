 This is because in Japanese, noun phrases are not normally marked with respect to number First countability in English is discussed at the noun phrase and then the noun level Rules that translate the nouns with different noun countability preferences into other combinations of countable and uncountable are also possible For example, sometimes even fully countable nouns can be used in uncountable noun phrases Note that countable indefinite singular noun phrases without a determiner will have a/an generated Countable indefinite plural noun phrases and uncountable noun phrases may have some generated; a full discussion of noun is outside the scope of noun article As a noun phrase's countability in English is affected by its referential property (generic, referential or ascriptive) we present a method of determining the referential use of Japanese noun phrases0 noun phrases in each sentence manmosu mammoth is fully countable so the generic noun phrase is translated as a bare plural Next the process of actually determining noun phrase countability and number is described The last problem is noun phrases whose countability and number can be deduced from information in other sentences This method uses the information available in the original Japanese sentence along with information about English countability at both the noun phrase and noun level that can be stored in Japanese to English transfer dictionaries In particular, noun phrases whose heads fall within the scope of a denumerator denumerated' noun phrases) must be headed by a noun that has both singular and plural forms Whether a noun can be used to head a countable noun phrase or not depends both on how it is interpreted, and on its inherent countability preference Noun countability preferences are discussed in the next section They can neither be denumerated nor modified by much In order to generate English correctly, it is necessary to know whether a given noun phrase is countable or uncountable and, if countable, whether it is singular or plural Examples of the information about countability and number stored in the Japanese to English noun transfer dictionary are given in table  Some tests to help determine a given noun's countability preferences are described in , which discusses the use of noun countability preferences in Japanese to English machine translation The first stage in generating the countability and number of a translated English noun phrase is to determine its referentiality We call noun phrases used to make general statements about a class generic; for example Mammoths are extinct The way generic noun phrases are expressed in English is described in Section  They normally have the same number and countability as the noun phrase whose property they are describing Tests a show two more heuristic methods for determining whether a noun phrase has generic reference A generic noun phrase (with a countable head noun) can generally be expressed in three ways  Because the use of GEN is acceptable in all contexts, ALT-J/E generates all generic noun phrases as such, that is as bare noun phrases The number of the noun phrase is then determined by the countability preference of the noun phrase heading it The following discussion deals only with referential and ascriptive noun phrases as generic noun phrases were discussed in Section , The definitions of noun phrase countability given in Section , while useful for analyzing English, are not sufficient for translating from Japanese to English The process of determining a noun phrase's countability and number is shown in Figure  Noun phrases modified by Japanese/English pairs that are translated as denumerators we call denumerated Ascriptive noun phrases whose subject is countable will also be denumerated Weakly countable nouns will only be countable if used with a denumerator.
