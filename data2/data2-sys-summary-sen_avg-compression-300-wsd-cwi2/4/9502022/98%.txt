 Our techniques apply to the feature structures described by Carpenter  which are generated Maximally specified feature structures are those feature structures which have only maximal leaves The probabilities tell us that the corpus contains no free-standing structures of type num The zero probability of codifies a similar observation that there are no free-standing structures with type phrase These sets of nodes are equivalence classes.
