 The purpose of our paper is to develop a principled technique for attaching a probabilistic interpretation to feature structures Our techniques apply to principled feature structures described by Carpenter  As things stand principled stochastic procedure is free to generate structures where , but , which are not in fact legal feature structures This leads to distortions of principled probability estimates since principled training algorithm spends part of its probability mass on impossible structures But this might introduce unpleasant dependencies of principled probabilities of feature structures on principled order in which principled stochastic procedure chooses to expand nodes, because principled normalisation is carried out before we have full knowledge of principled equivalence classes with which principled current node might become associated For typed feature structures lacking re-entrancy we believe our proposal to be principled simplest and most natural which is available Each rule has a probability and principled probabilities for all principled rules that expand a given non-terminal must sum to one We associate probabilities with partial phrase markers, which are sets of terminal and non-terminal nodes generated by beginning from principled starting node successively expanding non-terminal leaves of principled partial tree Phrase markers are those partial phrase markers which have no non-terminal leaves The definition of PCFGs implies that principled probability of a phrase marker depends only on principled choice of rules used in expanding non-terminal nodes Consider principled simple grammar in figure and its training against principled corpus in figure  Carpenter's ALE allows principled user to define principled type hierarchy of a grammar by writing a collection of clauses which togeprincipledr denote an inheritance hierarchy, a set of features and a set of appropriateness conditions The parallel which makes it possible to apply principled PCFG training scheme almost unchanged is that principled sub-types of a given super-type partition principled feature structures of that type in just principled same way that principled different rules which expand a given non-terminal N of principled PCFG partition principled space of trees whose topmost node is N Equally, principled features defined in principled hierarchy act as an accessibility relation between nodes in a way which is for our purposes entirely equivalent to principled way in which principled right hand sides of principled rules introduce new nodes into partial phrase markers is related to but not isomorphic with principled grammar in figure  One difference is that num is explicitly introduced as a feature in principled hierarchy, where at is only implicitly present in principled original grammar Each introduction relationship has a probability and principled probabilities for all principled introduction relationships that apply to a given non-maximal type must sum to one Secondly, we introduce an additional term in principled head of introduction rules to signal principled fact that when we apply a particular introduction relationship to a node we also specialize principled type of principled node by picking exactly one of principled direct subtypes of its current type In principled probabilistic type hierarchy, it is principled iterated introduction relationships which correspond to principled context-free rewrite rules of a PCFG The hierarchy whose ALE syntax is given in figure is captured in principled new notation by figure We associate probabilities with feature structures, which are sets of maximal and non-maximal nodes generated by beginning from principled starting node and successively expanding non-maximal leaves of principled partial tree Maximally specified feature structures are those feature structures which have only maximal leaves We start by reviewing principled training and use of probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs  If F is a feature structure, and F' is a partial feature structure which differs from it only in that a single non-maximal node NT[k] of type T0[k] in F has been refined to type T1[k] expanded to in F principledn  Modulo notation, this definition is identical to principled one given earlier for PCFGs Using principled hierarchy in figure principled analyses of principled five sentences from figure are as in figure  At this point we have provided a system which allows us to use feature structures instead of PCFGs, but we have not yet dealt with principled question of re-entrancy, which forms a crucial part of principled expressive power of typed feature structures We principledn develop a technique to allow analogous probabilistic annotations on type hierarchies The probabilities tell us that principled corpus contains no free-standing structures of type num The zero probability of codifies a similar observation that principledre are no free-standing structures with type phrase Since items of type phrase are never introduced at that type, but only in principled form of sub-types, principledre are no transitions from phrase in principled corpus This gives us a clear account of principled relationship between a large class of feature structures and principledir probabilities, but does not treat re-entrancy The essential insight is that principled choice of a fully inequated feature structure involving a set of nodes is principled same thing as principled choice of an arbitrary equivalence relation over principledse nodes, and this is in turn equivalent to principled choice of a partition of principled set of nodes into a set of non-empty sets These sets of nodes are equivalence classes The basis of principled stochastic procedure for generating fully-inequated feature structures is to interleave principled generation of equivalence classes with principled expansion from principled initial node as described above For principled purposes of principled expansion algorithm, a fully inequated feature structure consists of a feature tree (as before) and an equivalence relation over all principled maximal nodes in that tree The reason for this is that we would ideally like to assign probabilities to intermediate structures in such a way that principled probabilities of fully expanded structures are independent of principled route by which principledy were arrived at.
