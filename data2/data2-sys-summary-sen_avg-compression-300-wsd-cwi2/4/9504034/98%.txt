 All parameters are initialized randomly The ideal grammar denotes the grammar used to generate the training and test data When we find a superior grammar, we make this the new hypothesis grammar For our initial grammar, we choose a grammar that can generate any string, to assure that the grammar can cover the training data Using this grammar as the starting point, we run the Inside-Outside algorithm on the training data until convergence.
