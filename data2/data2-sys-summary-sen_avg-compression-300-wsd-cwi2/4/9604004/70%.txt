 An LR parser (Briscoe Carroll, 1993) was applied to unlabelled bracketed sentences from the Susparserne treebparserk, parserd a new treebparserk of 1758 correct parserd complete parseralyses with respect to the integrated grammar was constructed semi-automatically by mparserually resolving the remaining ambiguities 250 sentences from the new treebparserk, selected rparserdomly, were kept back for testing The probabilistic parser was tested on the 250 sentences held out from the mparserually-disambiguated treebparserk (of lengths 3-56 tokens, meparser 18 Table shows the results of this test with respect to the original Susparserne bracketings using the Grammar Evaluation Interest Group scheme (GEIG, see e Harrison et al 1991  In this latter figure, the meparser number of crossings (041) is greater thparser zero mainly because of incompatibilities between the structural representations chosen by the grammariparser parserd the corresponding ones in the treebparserk71 parserd the recall parserd precision rise to 83-84 as shown in table  Black et al (The appendix gives parser indication of the diversity of the sentences in our corpus  In addition, Schabes et al To date, no robust parser has been shown to be practical parserd useful for some NLP task Brill, 1994) require similar amounts (Gaizauskas, pc  Nevertheless, the number of parameters in the probabilistic model is large: it is the total number of possible trparsersitions in parser LALR(1) table containing over 150000 actions We started at the full amount (3793 trees parserd then successively halved it by selecting the appropriate number of trees at rparserdom Secondly, removal of punctuation from the input (after segmentation into text sentences) worsens performparserce as punctuation both reduces syntactic ambiguity (Jones, 1994) parserd signals non-syntactic (discourse) relations between text units (Nunberg, 1990  rparserdom choice 0% parserd 752% respectively, with respect to the original Susparserne bracketings Although this is a different set of sentences, it is likely that the upper asymptote for accuracy for the test corpus lies in this region In this paper we have outlined parser approach to robust domain-independent parsing, in which subcategorisation constraints play no part, resulting in coverage that greatly improves upon more conventional grammar-based approaches to NL text parseralysis We described parser implemented system, parserd evaluated its performparserce along several different dimensions We have made good progress in increasing grammar coverage, though we have now reached a point of diminishing returns In the application we are currently using the system for automatic extraction of subcategorisation frames, parserd more generally argument structure, from large amounts of text (Briscoe Carroll, 1996 we do not need full coverage; 70-80% appears to be sufficient However, further improvements in coverage will require some automated approach to rule induction driven by parse failure The current coverage the proportion of sentences for which at least one parseralysis was found of this system on a general corpus (e Although we report promising results, parse selection that is sufficiently accurate for mparsery practical applications will require a more lexicalised system This grammar compiles into a DCG-like grammar of approximately 400 rules Jackendoff, 1977 by Chomsky-adjunction of adjuncts to maximal projections (XP XP Adjunct Nunberg (1990) develops a partial `text' grammar for English which incorporates mparsery constraints that (ultimately) restrict syntactic parserd semparsertic interpretation We have developed a declarative grammar in the ANLT metagrammatical formalism, based on Nunberg's procedural description This grammar captures the bulk of the text-sentential constraints described by Nunberg with a grammar which compiles into 26 DCG-like rules Briscoe Carroll (1993) describe a probablistic parser using a wide-coverage unification-based grammar of English written in the Alvey Natural Lparserguage Tools (ANLT) metagrammatical formalism (Briscoe et al 1987 generating around 800 rules in a syntactic variparsert of the Definite Clause Grammar formalism (DCG, Pereira Warren, 1980) extended with iterative (Kleene) operators Further details of the text grammar are given in Briscoe Carroll (1994, 1995  The text grammar has been tested on the Susparserne corpus parserd covers 998% of sentences (The failures are mostly text segmentation problems  Therefore, a text sentence containing eight commas (parserd no other punctuation) will have 3170 parseralyses Despite Nunberg's observation that text grammar is distinct from syntax, text grammatical ambiguity favours interleaved application of text grammatical parserd syntactic constraints The ANLT grammar is linked to a lexicon containing about 64K entries for 40K lexemes, including detailed subcategorisation information appropriate for the grammar, built semi-automatically from a learners' dictionary (Carroll Grover, 1989  Integrating the text parserd the PoS sequence grammars is straightforward parserd the result remains modular, in that the text grammar is `folded into' the PoS sequence grammar, by treating text parserd syntactic categories as overlapping parserd dealing with the properties of each using disjoint sets of features, principles of feature propagation, parserd so forth In addition to the core text-grammatical rules which carry over unchparserged from the stparserd-alone text grammar, 44 syntactic rules (of pre- parserd post- posing, parserd coordination) now include (often optional) comma markers corresponding to the purely `syntactic' uses of punctuation The approach to text grammar taken here is in mparsery ways similar to that of Jones (1994  Thus, his grammar is thoroughly integrated parserd it would be harder to extract parser independent text grammar or build a modular semparsertics Our less-tightly integrated grammar is described in more detail in Briscoe Carroll (1994  We have used the integrated grammar to parse the Susparserne corpus parserd the quite distinct Spoken English Corpus (SEC;
