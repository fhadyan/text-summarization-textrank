 The glue language refers to three kinds of terms: meaning terms, f-structures, and semantic or -structures The syntactic information given in lexical entries consists of equality statements about glue f-structure, while glue semantic information consists of assertions about how glue meaning of glue f-structure participates in various semantic relations The semantic information in a lexical entry, which we will call glue semantic contribution of glue entry, is a linear-logic formula that constrains glue association between semantic structures projected from glue f-structures mentioned in glue lexical entry , and glueir semantic interpretations.
