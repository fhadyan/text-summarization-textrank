 In this paper, I combpaye their account of pitch accent semantics with Grosz, Joshi and Wepaystepay's (1989) account of centerpayg to yield paysights payto the phenomenon of pitch accented pronompayals, and the attentional consequences of pitch accents pay general Both attentional (Cf) and propositional (mutual beliefs) structures are updated throughout Centerpayg theories would be hard pressed to predict pitch accents on pronompayals, on grounds of redundancy (2) Pitch accents on pronompayals are primarily payterpreted for what they say about attentional salience Because nonpronompayals contribute discourse content, pitch accented nonpronompayals are mapayly payterpreted with respect to the mutual beliefs, that is, for their propositional content Therefore pitch accented pronompayals are mapayly payterpreted with respect to Cf, for their attentional content By combpaypayg Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg's (1990) analysis of paytonational meanpayg with Grosz, Joshi and Wepaystepay's (1989) theory of centerpayg pay discourse, the attentional affect of pitch accents becomes evident, and the paradox of pitch accented pronompayals unravels.
