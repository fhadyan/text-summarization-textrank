 Matching: Select all rules carrying the current category Conflict resolution: Select an element from the conflict set Any alternative is based on backtracking at least one rule Backtrack points correspond to conflict sets containing more than one element Both possibilities taken together allow a system that feeds TG/2 to specify linguistic criteria of preferred solutions to be generated first The criteria are defined in terms of rule names, and a criterion is fulfilled if some corresponding rule is successfully applied We call such a rule c-rule TG/2 implements a simple strategy that processes those backtrack points first that have conflict sets containing c-rules, and preferrably choses a c-rule from a conflict set Analyzing dependencies of criteria: The solution fulfilling most criteria is generated first if sets of mutually independent criteria are applied: fulfilling one criterion must not exclude the applicability of another one, unless two criteria correspond to rules of the same conflict set For every applied rule, the set of c-rules applied later in the current subtree of a derivation is stored However, different GIL structures may, for a TGL rule, lead to different sets of follow-up c-rules The rules are encoded in TGL, a language that allows the definition of canned text items, templates, and context-free rules within the same formalism TGL rules can, and should, be written with generation in mind, i In Section the formalism TGL (Template Generation Language) for production rules is introduced The properties of TGL allow for efficient generation of all possible solutions in any order TGL defines a general format for expressing production rules as precondition-action pairs (cf A TGL rule is applicable if its preconditions are met A TGL rule is successfully applied, if the action part has been executed without failure Failure to apply a TGL rule signals that the rule does not cover the portion of the input structure submitted to it Figure shows a sample TGL rule Every TGL rule has a unique name, denoted by the initial string They ensure that a set of TGL rules possesses a context-free backbone TGL rules are presently written using a text editor.
