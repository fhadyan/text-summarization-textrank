 Hence `co-operative' error processing Apart from anything else, `representative' is hard to decide - spectrum of errors or distribution of errors ? Secondly, any corpus of text usually contains only those errors that were left undetected in the text This would allow one measure of the (linguistic) feasibility of cooperative error processing: the effectiveness of shallow processing over errors revealed by the keystroke-record data To investigate issues involved in shallow processing and cooperative error handling, the pet (processing errors in text) system is being built.
