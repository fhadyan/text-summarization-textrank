 Initial maximum Highest accuracy on the first iteration, and falling thereafter With a good lexicon but either degraded transitions or a test corpus differing from the training corpus, the pattern tends to be early maximum When the test corpus is very similar to the model, then the pattern is iteration maximum If the test and training corpora are near-identical, do not use BW re-estimation; otherwise use for a small number of iterations If no such training corpus is available, but a lexicon with at least relative frequency data is available, use BW re-estimation for a small number of iterations If neither training corpus nor lexicon are available, use BW re-estimation with standard convergence tests such as perplexity Any transitions not seen in the training corpus are given a small, non-zero probability The lexicon lists, for each word, all of tags seen in the training corpus with their probabilities The first experiment concerned the effect of the iteration conditions on the accuracy using Baum-Welch re-estimation.
