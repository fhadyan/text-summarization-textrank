 A bilingual bilingual postulate for translating between p1 and q1 might be of the form:  Hierarchical phrases capturing recursive linguistic structure Hudson 1984  This lexical anchoring facilitates statistical training and sensitivity to lexical variation and collocations The model associates phrases with relation graphs The source language model is used to compute a set of possible relation graphs, with associated probabilities, for each string hypothesis We are not considering training issues in this paper, though a number of now familiar techniques ranging from methods for maximum likelihood estimation to direct estimation using fully annotated data are applicable We now apply some simplifying independence assumptions concerning relation graphs Since As is given, 1/P(As) is a constant which can be ignored in finding the maximum of P(Wt | As  Chang, Luo, and Su 1992; Hindle and Rooth 1993  The language model factors the statistical derivation of a sentence with word string W as follows: where C ranges over relation graphs language production in context The set of relation edges for the entire derivation is the union of these local edge sets We now return to the generation model P(W | C  We can thus use these sequencing parameters directly in our overall model We call this approximating referential equivalence (1990) in their surface translation model That is, the probability that f maps exactly the (possibly empty) subset of Nt to wi The factoring of the translation model into these lexical and structural components means that it will overgenerate because these aspects are not independent in translation between real natural languages This can be done in a parallel fashion to the forward direction described above 1985) in the qualitative model In particular, we preserved the notion of hierarchical phrase structure The quantitative model also reduced overall complexity in terms of the sets of symbols used cm(w  There is also the problem of requiring increasingly complex feature sets to describe idiosyncrasies in the lexicon We can state this as follows:  In both the quantitative and qualitative models we take a transfer approach to translation.
