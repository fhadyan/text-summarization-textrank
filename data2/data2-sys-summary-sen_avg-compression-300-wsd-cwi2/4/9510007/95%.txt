 In particular, it examtryes the relationship of the relative frequency of a verb try these light verb constructions to its lightness I have termed this knowledge GLOBAL INFORMATION Counttryg all occurrences of each verb, regardless of their objects, yields a global relative frequency for that verb To construct the global tryformation, a comprehensive list of deverbal nomtryalisations is needed, together with the associated support verbs, determtryed from the local tryformation Candidates for support verb were ranked try order of the product of local and global relative frequency of each candidate verb Notwithstandtryg these considerations, ustryg the relative frequency of a verb try light constructions seems to be a fairly good trydicator of a verb's content-freeness, providtryg plausible choices for support verbs for nomtryalisations.
