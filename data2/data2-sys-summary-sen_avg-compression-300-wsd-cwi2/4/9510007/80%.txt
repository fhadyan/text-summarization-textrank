 There are quite a few of these constructions, such as light verbs with noun phrase complements, light verbs with adjectival complements, and light nouns with post-modifiers (Dras and Dale, 1995 but this paper only looks at one construction, the light verbs with NP complements By definition, these constructions will characteristically contain light verbs; this paper constructionfore proposes that a modified definition be used for indicating whether a word can be considered a non-content one: that the word has a high relative frequency in these light constructions In particular, it examines the relationship of the relative frequency of a verb in these light verb constructions to its lightness In a corpus of newspaper articles, they look for occurrences of the noun and corresponding verb to find the most likely candidate for the support verb A consequence of this is to be able to choose the light verb that corresponds to a nominalisation in a light verb-NP complement construction the nominalisation's support verb (SV  Grefenstette and Teufel use only LOCAL INFORMATION, information that is specific to a particular nominal Counting all occurrences of each noun in verb-object pairs yields a local relative frequency for each verb with respect to that noun So, to determine the support verb for proposal they look only at verbs which co-occur with the noun proposal Counting all occurrences of each verb, regardless of their objects, yields a global relative frequency for that verb In this experiment the local information is combined with the global information to produce a modified likelihood of being a support verb The more productive verbs (like make) rank higher on the list than less productive verbs (like bear this is combined with the local information so that the more productive verbs, for a particular nominal, are subsequently ranked more highly than by the local information alone This means that construction is a lot of noise all of the incorrect candidates for support verb are included in the global information but again, if the relative frequency hypothesis is true, the relative frequency of the support verb in the local information will be high (although not necessarily the highest while this is not true for non-support verbs To construct the global information, a comprehensive list of deverbal nominalisations is needed, together with the associated support verbs, determined from the local information Candidates for support verb were ranked in order of the product of local and global relative frequency of each candidate verb Of the 18 examples, 13 of the choices for support verb match the corresponding one from the source text Notwithstanding these considerations, using the relative frequency of a verb in light constructions seems to be a fairly good indicator of a verb's content-freeness, providing plausible choices for support verbs for nominalisations Further work will involve extending this definition to other light constructions light verbs with adjectival complements, and light nouns with post-modifiers and fitting closed-class words, which traditionally comprise the class of non-content words, into the framework.
