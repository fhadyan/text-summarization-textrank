 Most of natural languages provide two types of lexical items to describe the motion of an entity with respect to some location: motion verbs (to run; to enter) and spatial prepositions (from; towards  Motion verbs can be used directly with a location, when they are transitive (to cross the town) or with a spatial preposition, when they are intransitive (to go through the town  The linguistic study of French intransitive motion verbs (see eg With the help of this ontology we have realized a typology for intransitive motion verbs Change of location (CoL) verbs (entrer-to enter; sortir-to go out) denote a change of location inside/outside) before and after the motion Change of position verbs (voyager-to travel; courir-to run) denote a change of position Such verbs do not behave all homogeneously The latter case is more interesting: verb of the French motion verbs are intransitive and the interaction between motion verbs and spatial prepositions gives detailed informations about the way human beeings mentally represent spatiotemporal aspects of a motion We call these verbs change of position (CoPs) verbs We call these verbs inertial change of position (ICoPs) verbs For the following, we will focus on CoL verbs (the Change of Location verbs mainly because they are rich in spatiotemporal informations, but also because we have at disposal exhaustive lists of French CoL verbs We have realized a systematic and fine linguistic study on these verbs, looking carefully at each of them, one by one (and we have 440 CoL verbs in French in order to extract their intrinsic spatiotemporal properties Indeed, verbs like sortir intrinsically suggest a location of which we have gone out As we have come to these distinctions by examining different linguistic material, we conclude that language structures space in the same way whatever sort of lexical items (motion verbs (dynamic static) spatial prepositions) we examine We have followed the same approach with French spatial prepositions, but using a structuration of the space induced by the location introduced in the PP by the preposition, and not induced by the lref as for verbs We have classified 199 such French prepositions into 16 groups using in addition of our zones two other criteria: prepositions can be: positional (like in) directional (like into) directional prepositions can be: Initial (like from) Medial (like through) Final (like to) depending if they focus on the initial location, on the path or on the final location of the motion The linguistic studies, used for the typologies of CoL verbs and spatial prepositions, have been realized on verbs considered without any adjuncts, in their atemporal form and independently of any context, on the one hand, and on prepositions considered independently of any context, on the other We present such linguistic investigations on French motion verbs and spatial prepositions and the basic concepts we have found The location le jardin-the garden is the final location of the motion We also address compositional semantics for motion complexes (ie These axioms are based on the lexical semantics of CoL verbs and of spatial prepositions Following Gruber (1965 Jackendoff (1976 Boons (1985 we approach motion verbs in terms of some localist semantical role labels.
