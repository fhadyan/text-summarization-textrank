 I will treatment in this paper that a discourse is a sequence of utterances produced (spoken or written) by one or more discourse participants In sum, with the ILF sealing off the space of grammatical reasoning, the present discourse processing architecture magnifies the importance of pragmatics in utterance interpretation This section discusses the features and examples of the defeasible rules in the pragmatics subsystem This characterizes the preferential aspect of utterance interpretation with the nonmonotonicity property The present focus is the interpretation preferences of intersentential pronominal anaphora Computational research on pronoun interpretation has always recognized the existence of powerful grammatical preferences, but there are different views on their status in the overall processing architecture Sidner's (1983) local focusing model used an attentional representation level to mediate the grammar's control of discourse inferencese tendency to be centrally about one thing at a time) to control the amount of computation required in discourse interpretation These computational approaches to discourse have recognized the non-truth-conditional effects on utterance interpretation coming from the utterance's surface structure (i Although this aspect of interpretation cannot be neglected in a discourse processing model, its relevance to a logical model of discourse semantics and pragmatics has remained unclear An example of defeasible preferences is the interpretation of the pronoun he in discourse John hit Bill Pronoun interpretation must be carried out in an often vast space of possibilities, somehow controlling the inferences with default preferences coming from different aspects of the current context In 1993, I conducted a survey of pronoun interpretation preferences using the discourse examples shown in Table 1 One group isolates the grammatical effects by minimizing commonsense biases In these examples, it is conjectured that there is no relevant commonsense knowledge that affects the pronoun interpretation in question Crucially, this preference is overridden in certain contexts Insignificant preference is interpreted to mean ambiguity or incoherence The present set of examples highlights four major sources of preference in pronoun interpretation SUBJECT Antecedent Preference, Pronominal Chain Preference, Grammatical Parallelism Preference, and Commonsense Preference SUBJECT Antecedent Preference This preference is confirmed in examples A and B Pronominal Chain Preference This processing tendency indicates that the grammatical preference is processed faster than the commonsense preference Grammatical Parallelism Preference This preference is demonstrated in example D that involves two pronouns In example L, the parallelism preference overrides the pronominal chain preference An x hit y back event conventionally presupposes that a y hit x event has previously occurred, leading to the near-unanimous interpretation Bill hit John back Commonsense Preference Examples F-H illustrate the effect of a simple causal knowledge that dictates the final interpretation over and above the grammatical preferences Conventional Presuppositions (triggered by adverbs in examples C and E) and Commonsense Preferences (examples F, G, and H) dictate the final preference Grammatical Preferences take charge in the absence of relevant Commonsense Preferences (examples A-E, K, and L  The SUBJECT Antecedent Preference overrides the Grammatical Parallelism Preference when in conflict (see examples A and B and both are in turn stronger than the Pronominal Chain Preference (example L  Utterance interpretation depends on the context, and utterance meaning updates the context Four major sources of preference have been identified in the above pronoun interpretation examples The context components the most relevant to the present discussion are the attentional state A, the LF register , and the discourse model D The main thrust of the present account is the general interaction of preferences that apply on different context components The present perspective of preference interactions also extends and explains the role of the attentional state in Grosz and Sidner's (1986) discourse theory A discourse describes situations, eventualities, and entities, together with the relations among them We will now recast some elements of the centering model in the present discourse processing architecture The pragmatics subsystem contains sets of preference rules that, in certain combinations, could lead to conflicting preferences From EXP ORDER, it follows that a pronoun normally realizes a maximally salient entity in the input attentional state A pronoun can also realize a submaximally salient entity if this choice is supported by another overriding preference The interactions of the above defeasible rules CENTER, GF ORDER, EXP ORDER, and EXP CENTER account for various descriptive generalizations First, the SUBJECT Antecedent Preference follows from GF ORDER and EXP ORDER SUBJECT is the highest ranked GF in the first utterance, and a pronoun in the second utterance realizes the maximally salient entity in the input A Existing logical semantic theories employing dynamic interpretation rules (e The grammatical parallelism of two adjacent utterances in discourse affects the preferred interpretation of pronouns (Kameyama, 1986 tense (Kameyama, Passonneau, and Poesio, 1993 and ellipsis (Pruest, 1992; Kehler, 1993  GF ORDER, EXP ORDER, and PARA join forces to create a strong grammatical preference for SUBJECT-SUBJECT coreference (examples D,K  When maximal salience is indeterminate, the parallelism preference affects the choice (example L leading to a noncoreference preference for an OBJECT-SUBJECT pronominal chain The discourse model contains a set of information states about situations, eventualities, entities, and the relations among them It also contains the evolving discourse structure, temporal structure, and event structure Both linguistic semantics and commonsense preferences apply on the same discourse model Adverbs too and back trigger conventional presuppositionsabout the input discourse model Consider each of the following utterances immediately preceding John hit Bill too Mary hit Bill John hit Mary Mary kicked Bill John kicked Mary Mary hit Jane and `John called Bill  That is, the utterance Bill hit John back presupposes that it occurred after John hit Bill  Commonsense Knowledge Lascarides and Asher (1993) extend the Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp, 1981) with the interaction of defeasible rules for integrating a new utterance content into the discourse information state The SUBJECT Antecedent Preference and Pronominal Chain Preference result from CENTER, GF ORDER, EXP ORDER, and EXP CENTER These are the defeasible Attentional Rules (ATT) stating the preferred attentional state transitions The Grammatical Parallelism Preference is PARA Conventional presuppositions triggered by too and back are examples of the indefeasible Semantic Rules (SEM) in the grammar constraining the interpretation in the discourse model These are examples of the defeasible Commonsense Rules (WK) stating the preferred discourse model Table 4 identifies the rules that dominate the final interpretation in examples A-L Rules: ATT CENTER, GF ORDER, EXP ORDER, EXP CENTER LF PARA WK HIT, ETC SEM TOO, BACK  General Features The SEM rules are indefeasible whereas all other rules are defeasible It is predicted that indefeasible rules override all defeasible rules, as verified in examples C and E What factor determines the interaction pattern among the defeasible rules? The three context components discourse model D, attentional state A, and LF register all have their preferred transitions The D preference results from proposition-level (or sentence-level inferences directly determining the preferred model whereas the A and LF preferences result from entity-level (or term-level inferences only indirectly determining the preferred model Take two examples: (1) John met Bill He was injured and (2) John hit Bill He was injured In (1 the ATT and LF preference that the pronoun refers to John indirectly leads to the preference that John was injured, which becomes the overall preference in the absence of relevant WK rules These flows of preference during an utterance interpretation are illustrated below: (1) [S [NP he John]Bill} ] John was injured (2) [S [NP he John]Bill} Bill was injured ] John was injured} Bill was injured Conflict Resolution Patterns It may be the general pattern of changing preferences during utterance interpretation Let discourse be a sequence of utterances,  The preference interaction patterns discussed here can perhaps be formulated as fine-grained upgrading inferences during utterance interpretation within the proposed utterance interpretation architectureg Perrault, 1990; Thomason, 1990; Jaspars, 1994 A discourse processing architecture with desirable computational properties consists of a grammar subsystem representing the space of possibilities and a pragmatics subsystem representing the space of preferences Utterance interpretation induces a complex interaction of defeasible rules in the pragmatics subsystem Upon scrutiny of a set of examples involving intersentential pronominal anaphora, I have identified different groups of defeasible rules that determine the preferred transitions of different components of the dynamic context There are grammatical preferences inducing fast entity-level inferences only indirectly suggesting the preferred discourse model, and commonsense preferences inducing slow proposition-level inferences directly determining the preferred discourse model We say that utterance utti defines a transition relation between the input context Ci-1 and the output context Ci The attentional state in the context supports the formulation of attentional rules that significantly affect pronoun interpretation preferences Di is the discourse model a set of information states that the discourse has been about, which also incorporates the content of  The slow-changing components are the linguistic knowledge L and world knowledge K used by the discourse participants Although we know that discourse participants never share exactly the same mental state representing these components of the context, there must be a significant overlap in order for a discourse to be mutually intelligible Vague predicates and functions represent various expression and construction types whose interpretation depends on the discourse context Preferences are affected by computationally expensive open-ended commonsense inferences This includes the integration of the utterance content into the evolving discourse structure, event structure, and temporal structure in the context, as discussed by Lascarides and Asher (1993  The ILF also leaves open how the given utterance is integrated into the temporal, event, and discourse structures in the context These structures are treatmentd to be in the discourse model D The pragmatics subsystem must make all of the preferential decisions including NP interpretation and operator interpretation as well as contextual integration.
