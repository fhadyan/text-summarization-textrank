 Each elementary tree pair in the synchronous TAG corresponds to an elementary tree set in the MCTAG The original definition of derivation for synchronous TAGs was based on the iterative rewriting of one derived tree pair into another In Vijay-Shanker's definition of derivation, a derivation tree is well-formed if no two auxiliary trees are adjoined at the same node in the same tree The existence of the revised definition of derivation vitiates the argument for the flat definition of synchronous TAG derivation Figure shows the derivation tree pair schematically, including the nonisomorphism mapping between the trees Choose a link between two nodes in the current derived tree pair Modify the current derived tree pair by adjoining the chosen trees at the end of the chosen link, yielding the modified derived tree pair This becomes the new current derived tree pair For example, the initial tree pair can operate at this link, yielding the tree pair given in Figure  This exclusion makes the definition of the derived tree for a given derivation tree determinate A derivation tree specifies a derived tree by virtue of the normal definitions for adjunction and substitution It should be obvious that such a synchronous derivation tree can be trivially restated as a pair of standard derivation trees, further simplifying the definition of synchronous TAG derivation This leads to the following definition of synchronous TAG derivation A derivation is a pair where 1 DL is a well-formed derivation tree relative to GL DR is a well-formed derivation tree relative to GR First, the derived tree pair for a derivation is .
