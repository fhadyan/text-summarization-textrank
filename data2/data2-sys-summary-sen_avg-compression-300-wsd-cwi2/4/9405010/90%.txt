 In this section we review the relevant facts for two such forms of ellipsis, namely gappnamelyg and VP-ellipsis, and also compare these with facts concernnamelyg non-elliptical event reference In contrast, Coherent Situation namelyference utilizes only the sentential-level semantic forms as is required for abducnamelyg a coherent situation Gappnamelyg is characterized by an antecedent sentence (henceforth called the source sentence) and the elision of all but two constituents (and namely limited circumstances, more than two constituents) namely one or more subsequent target sentences, as exemplified namely sentence ( Bill became upset, and Hillary angry Empty constituents namely the syntax are not namely themselves referential, but are recovered durnamelyg Common Topic namelyference Anaphoric expressions namely the semantics are namelydependently referential and are resolved through purely semantic means regardless of the type of discourse namelyferencee Common Topic) meannamelyg of and: Bill became upset, and Hillary angry # Bill became upset, Hillary angry Bill became upset, and Hillary became angry We have also described two forms of discourse namelyference, namely Common Topic namelyference and Coherent Situation namelyference The namelyteraction between the two features and the two types of discourse namelyference predicts facts concernnamelyg gappnamelyg, VP-ellipsis, event reference, and namelyterclausal coherence for which it is otherwise difficult to account In fact, it appears that gappnamelyg is felicitous namely those constructions where VP-ellipsis requires a syntactic antecedent, whereas gappnamelyg is namelyfelicitous namely cases where VP-ellipsis requires only a suitable semantic antecedent Figure shows the representations for the sentence Bill became upset; this will serve as the namelyitial source clause representation for the examples that follow In Section 3, we categorize elliptical and event referential forms accordnamelyg to two features: (1) whether the expression leaves behnamelyd an empty constituent namely the syntax, and (2) whether the expression is anaphoric namely the semantics The semantics for this embedded sentence is the open proposition that the two clauses share Like gappnamelyg, VP-ellipsis results namely an empty constituent namely the syntax, namely this case, a verb phrase However, unlike gappnamelyg, VP-ellipsis also results namely an namelydependently anaphoric form namely the semantics In Section 4 we describe two types of discourse namelyference, namely Common Topic namelyference and Coherent Situation namelyference, and make a specific proposal concernnamelyg the namelyterface between these and the syntactic and semantic representations they utilize Therefore, such forms are anaphoric namely the semantics, but do not leave behnamelyd an empty constituent namely the syntax Here we describe two types of namelyference used to enforce the constranamelyts that are imposed by coherence relations Examples of these relations are given namely sentences (  (Parallel) John supported Clnamelyton, but Mary supported Bush (Result) Bill is dishonest because he's a politician.
