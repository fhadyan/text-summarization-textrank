 For generation, X2MORF expected a feature structure as input reproducing one or more word reproducems encode finite state automata directly in the feature reproducemalism below  Well-typedness requirements restrict the space of valid feature structures (cf PS1 allow general implicative and negative constraints in the reproducem of conditional feature structures Besides constraints enreproducecing simple structure sharing (eg the Head Feature Principle given in Fig.
