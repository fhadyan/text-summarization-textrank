 The translations were compared by checking how well translation output Japanese sentence conveyed translation meaning of translation input English sentence The results of our experiments show translation effectiveness of this method; moreover, implementation of this method on a machine translation system improved translation accuracy of its translation9 of translation 54 sentences Then, except for sentences with incomplete parses and multiple parses, translation results of each parse are stored as discourse information1) Fig In translation second partial parse, translation word side is analyzed as a verb 3 and 12 (151st sentence) (33) Fig To examine translation possibility of modification, discourse information is applied at three different levels Next, if translationre is no identical pattern, a modification pattern with a synonym of translation node on one side is searched for in translation discourse information Since sentences with incomplete parses are usually quite long and contain complicated structures, it is hard to obtain a perfect analysis for those sentences The results are shown in Table .
