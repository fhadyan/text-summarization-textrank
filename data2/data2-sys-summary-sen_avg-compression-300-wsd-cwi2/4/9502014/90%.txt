 Ellipsis interpretations are represented as simple sets of substitutions on semantic representations of the antecedent The pronominal term occurs in the restriction of the book term  The interpretation can be represented as which is conjoined with the antecedent For the QLF to be interpretable, it is necessary to give the antecedent book term wide scope over the interpretation in order to discharge the index As above, the antecedent pronoun is constrained to be given wide scope over the interpretation, on pain of the index h being undischargeable The first reading involves scoping the book quantifier before interpretation resolution The modification is to allow (strict) substitutions on terms not explicitly appearing in the interpretation antecedent i the implicit his paper in the second interpretation when resolving the third interpretation Multiple VP Ellipsis Multiple VP interpretation poses problems at the level of determining which VP is the antecedent of which interpretation Other Forms of Ellipsis: Other forms of interpretation, besides VP-interpretation can be handled substitutionally agent(e john  In VP interpretation, strict identity corresponds to copying the entire role assignment from the antecedent As this example illustrates, tense and aspect on interpretation and antecedent do not have to agree When this is so, the antecedent and interpretation categories are both used to determine what should be substituted for the antecedent  This is reflected in the order-sensitive interleaving of scope and interpretation resolution in DSP's account Section concludes The interpretation of the interpretation is then given by applying this predicate to the subject of the interpretation The elliptical QLF will contain a predicate formed from the antecedent QLF plus substitutions Any uninstantiated meta-variables in the antecedent are thus re-entrant in the interpretation Consequently, any further resolutions to the antecedent are automatically imposed on the interpretation It was noted above that substitutions on term indices in scope nodes ensures scope parallelism Whichever scoping is given to the antecedent, a parallel scoping should be given to the interpretation This increases the computational complexity of the interpretation resolution task gives `every house' wide scope over both antecedent and interpretation In this case the two terms, in interpretation and antecedent are both discharged (i We need to distinguish between parallel and non-parallel terms in interpretation antecedents Parallel terms, like John in the example above, are those that correspond terms appearing explicitly in the interpretation We replace both the term and its index by the corresponding term and index from the interpretation A strict substitution substitutes the term by its index In this way, the version of the term occurring in the interpretation is directly linked to antecedent term.
