 Arguments for stacked X-bar structures (such as immediately dominating with the same head) are command against dependency grammar as normally understood Dependency grammar runs into substantial difficulty trying to account for the proform one Dependency grammar (DG) describes syntactic structure in terms of links between individual words rather than constituency trees Dependency grammar can do no such thing, because in dependency grammar as normally understood, all the modifiers hang from the same node (Figure 4  A second difficulty with dependency grammar comes from semantics Given a head (X) and its dependents, attach the dependents to the head by forming stacked nodes as follows: 1 The fundamental relation in DG is between head and dependent Then attach modifiers, one at a time, by working outward from the one nearest the head noun, and adding a stacked node for each.
