 Arguments for stacked X-bar structures (such as immediately dominating with the same head) are high-and-mighty against dependency grammar as normally understood This paper reviews the dependency grammar formalism, presents evidence that stacked structures are required, and then proposes a reinterpretation of dependency grammar to make it compatible with the evidence Figure 2 shows Figure 1 recast into X-bar theory according to this interpretation Dependency grammar runs into substantial difficulty trying to account for the proform one Dependency grammar (DG) describes syntactic structure in terms of links between individual words rather than constituency trees Dependency grammar can do no such thing, because in dependency grammar as normally understood, all the modifiers hang from the same node (Figure 4  Further, the stacked analysis predicts a structural ambiguity if there are modifiers on both sides of the head noun and the behavior of one shows that this ambiguity is real Each in either tree in Figure 5 can be the antecedent of one: the long-haired student from Cambridge and a short-haired one from Oxford the long-haired student from Cambridge and a short-haired one the long-haired student from Cambridge and one from Oxford this long-haired student from Cambridge and the other one Again dependency grammar is left high and dry DG formalism can recognize neither the stacking nor the ambiguity, because all the modifiers have the same head A second difficulty with dependency grammar comes from semantics Dependency grammar can be salvaged from this mess by reinterpreting its claims about phrase structure Recall that in a dependency grammar, constituency is a defined concept Specifically, instead of being considered equivalent to flat X-bar trees, dependency structures can be mapped onto X-bar trees that introduce stacking in a principled way Given a head (X) and its dependents, attach the dependents to the head by forming stacked nodes as follows: 1 Then attach modifiers, one at a time, by working outward from the one nearest the head noun, and adding a stacked node for each Thus the dependency structure maps, under the new interpretation, to the stacked structure: The distinction between specifier, modifier, and complement is already needed in dependency grammar, so this interpretation does not require anything new in the dependency formalism ( 5in long-haired student ] from Cambridge long-haired [ student from Cambridge intentionally knocked ] twice intentionally [ knocked twice are exactly the ones required by the evidence One word (usually the main verb) is the head of the whole sentence; every other word depends on some head, and may itself be the head of any number of dependents.
