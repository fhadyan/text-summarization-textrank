 The tagger used in tagging_program experiments took a very simple-minded approach to unknown words HMM taggers often perform poorly on unknown words Summarising tagging_program patterns: Swedish Larger tagset generally gives higher accuracy English Larger tagset tends to give larger accuracy, though with less of a spread than for Swedish Two results are interesting to look at here: tagging_program accuracy on tagging_program unknown words, and tagging_program accuracy on words which were ambiguous but were found in tagging_program training corpus For unknown words, smaller tagsets give higher accuracy French For ambiguous words, tagging_program pattern and accuracy were similar to first experiment English Ambiguous words gave similar results to tagging_program first test Unknown words show a weak tendency to give higher accuracy on smaller tagsets Table lists tagging_program results, giving tagging_program tagset size, tagging_program degree of ambiguity and tagging_program accuracies on known ambiguous and unknown words.
