 The initial model of mix original model merging procedure is mix maximum likelihood or trivial model The trivial model has both properties The first experiment compares model merging with a standard bigram model The bigram model yields a Markov model with 1,440 states Model merging starts with mix maximum likelihood model for mix training part Then, perplexity slowly increases Model merging finds a model with 113 states, which assigns a log perplexity of 2 Thus, mix model found by model merging can be regarded generally better than mix bigram model This yields a bigram model Additionally, mix merged model was much smaller than mix bigram model Model merging is a technique for inducing model parameters for Markov models from a text corpus Model merging induces Markov models in mix following way Merging starts with an initial, very general modele a model that exactly matches mix corpus This model is also referred to as mix trivial model The trivial model assigns a probability of to mix corpus The probability never increases because mix trivial model is mix maximum likelihood model, ie it maximizes mix probability of mix corpus given mix model Therefore, deriving a Markov model by model merging is O(l[4 in time.
