 Listing 1 The linguist provides SemHe with three pieces of data: a lexicon, two-level rules and word formation grammar The resulting stems are assigned 1 (Rules 3-4 in Listing 8  Rules 5-8 (Listing 8) handle this 50 rules  = sing 2nd masc  The two-level grammar (Listing 1) assumes three lexical tapes To analyse a surface form, one calls TWO-LEVEL-ANALYSIS Surf, -Lex, -Partition, -Parse  To generate a surface form, one calls TWO-LEVEL-ANALYSIS Surf, +Lex, -Partition, -Parse  Hence, lexical descriptions of stems make use of three lexical tapes (pattern, root vocalism while those of prefixes and suffixes use the first lexical tape This requires duplicating rules when stating lexical constraints Rule R7 (Listing 7) is required A second set of rules can allow the deletion of vowels.
