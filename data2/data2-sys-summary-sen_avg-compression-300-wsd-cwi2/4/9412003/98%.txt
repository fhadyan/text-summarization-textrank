 Let C be the maximal number of clusters for G, bunch E be the number of elements one tries to cluster (e If, based on some heuristic, one could select a fixed number t of target clusters, then one could only try moving w to these tclusters, rather than to all possible clusters C One can thus calculate the heuristic score of all C clusters in O(C  One frequently used approach to alleviate this problem is to construct a clustered language model One can see that the clustered trigram outperforms the clustered bigram, at least with sufficient training data Taking the logarithm, one obtains the final optimisation criterion F LO  One way to alleviate this problem is to use class based models00002*109  Given these probability estimates pG(w|v the likelihood FMLof the training data, e.
