 Collocations present specific problems in translation, both in human and automatic contexts It is essentially in addressing the issue of overgenerality that Mel'cuk introduces sub- and superscripts to lexical functions, enhancing their precision and making them sensitive to meaning aspects of the lexical items over which they operateg ( ( that collocational systems are systematically predictable from the lexical semantics of nouns We consider one case briefly One way to emulate such a mapping might be through the use of Mel'cuk's lexical paraphrasing rules For instance, one could conceive of a lexical paraphrasing rule as follows:  Again, we suggest the use of merged LFs and corresponding mappings via lexical paraphrasing rules as a possible translation strategy in these cases In this paper we have discussed how the lexicographical concept of lexical functions, introduced by Mel'cuk to describe juxtaposition, can be used as an interlingual device in the machine translation of such structures We have been concerned with investigating the lexical functions (LFs) of Mel'cuk ( ) as a candidate interlingual device for the translation of adjectival and verbal collocates Our use of lexical functions as an interlingua assumes that the relevant aspects of the meaning of the collocate are fully captured by the LF We have suggested some ways in which LFs can be enriched with lexical semantic information to improve translation quality Given that juxtaposition may translate as non-juxtaposition, we also have to provide a way to represent these expressions using lexical functions The use we make of lexical functions as interlingual representations, does not respect their original Mel'cukian interpretation In the lexical combinatorics zone, we find a list of the lexical functions that are relevant to this particular lexeme It seems then that adjectives which are not literal translations of one another may share meaning properties specifically in the collocational context Each lexical function is followed by one or more lexemes (the result or value of the function applied to the head word  The argument corresponds to the base and each value is a collocate Lexical functions are used to represent an important syntactico-semantic relation between the base and the collocate The second of these characteristics points out that the collocational restriction is seen as a purely lexical, idiosyncratic one: all juxtaposition are explicitly listed Mel'cuk deals with this by including in the ECD an entry for the free variant and putting the collocate-specific information in the entry for the base (with the result of the lexical functions  The full entry of the collocate is the result of taking the entry for the free variant and overwriting it with the information provided at the base Choosing the level at which lexical functions will be situated Relating the collocate information to the free variant entry As far as the second problem is concerned, the obvious place to put lexical functions is in the semantic representation provided by HPSG One is that LFs are used in the deep syntax level in Mel'cuk's model, a level oriented towards meaninge intensification, and hence establish a single meaning representation for the adjectives which can be viewed as an interlingual pivot for translation Another reason is that this level seems most appropriate to be used in transfer/translation and because we want to use lexical functions in transfer, this is where they should be In contrast to the ECD, the meaning of the collocate is represented by the lexical function only The following is an example of the entry for criticism with the encoding of strong as a collocate In our case, the feature ` COLLS' has a set of lexical entries as its value Each collocate subentry bears the value of the lexical function in its semantics field In this representation the lexical function is chosen as the real semantic value of the collocate The collocate subentry only provides partial information So far, we have not specified in what way one gets from the lexical entries for the base and the collocate to the representation of the collocational expression The adjunct daughter will contain the adjective collocate In such collocational constructions the collocate adjuncts have to be `licensed' by the noun or the head daughter This is implemented by requiring that the collocates field ( COLLS) of the head daughter contains a reference to a lexical entry that is compatible with the adjunct daughter The project has tried to investigate the use of lexical functions as an interlingual device, ie one which is shared by the semantic representations of juxtaposition in the language pairs This information is used to generate the correct translation in the target language This treatment of juxtaposition rests, among others, on the assumptions that there are only a limited number of lexical functions, that lexical functions can be assigned consistently, that all (or a significant number of) juxtaposition realise a lexical function, that lexical functions are not restricted to particular languages, etc Using a semantic representation as input to transfer implies that we relate semantic values of words and phrases For our purposes this is very satisfying since we will now be using the semantics of collocates instead of their orthography, in other words: we use lexical functions and abstract away from the particular realisation of a collocate in a particular language We now state the relation between the semantic representations of the source language and target language Thus, for translating heavy smoker into grand fumeur we will need the obvious entry for smoker-fumeur plus the entry below: The interlingual status of the lexical function is self-evident Lexical Functions abstract away from certain nuances in meaning and from different syntactic realizations An important problem stems from the interpretation of LFs implied by their use as an interlingua namely that the meaning of the collocate in some ways reduces to the meaning implied by the lexical function.
