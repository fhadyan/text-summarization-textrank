 If we also consider words joined with clitics, the number of dcombinationferent combinations is much higher, namely 6525 When we have only one tag for all the prepositions, for example, a sequence like determiner noun noun/verb preposition is frequently disambiguated in the wrong way by the statistical tagger, e The word part is ambiguous between a noun and a verb (singular, third person and the tagger seems to prefer the noun reading between a singular noun and a preposition Writing rules that map a tag or a sequence of tags into a new tag is rather straightforward, but redefining the source lexicon would imply complex and time consuming work The initial lexicon contains all the inflectional information For a statistical tagger however, a big tagset may be a major problem This in turn requires that forms like danses- and chante-t- be introduced into the new lexicon it is either a plural noun or a verb form that belongs to the collapsed first or second person paradigm Words not found in the lexicon are analysed by a separate finite-state transducer, the guesser er identcombinationies not only infinitive verbs but also nouns, due to possible borrowings from English These endings belong to the most frequent ending patterns in the lexicon, where every rare word weights as much as any frequent word the misspelt verb forms appellaient, geulait har-mo-ni-ser, also leave endings unaltered Generally, the guesser does not recognise words belonging to closed classes (conjunctions, prepositions, etc under the assumption that closed classes are fully described in the basic lexicon A possible improvement to the guesser would be to incorporate frequent spelling errors for words that are not otherwise recognised We extracted, from a corpus of newspaper articles (Libration a list of 13 500 words unknown to the basic lexicon Of those unknown words, 9385 (i about 70 are capitalised words, which are correctly and unambiguously analysed by the guesser as proper nouns with more than 95 % accuracy The test on the remaining 4000 non-capitalised unknown words is more interesting We randomly selected 800 of these words and ran the guesser on them 1192 tags were assigned to those 800 words by the guesser, which gives an average of 15 tags per word For 113 words, at least one required tag was missing (118 tags were missing as a whole, 4 words were lacking more than one tag: they are misspelt irregular verbs that have not been recognised as such  This means that 86 % of the words got all the required tags from the guesser This concerned 244 words, which means that 70 % of the words did not get any irrelevant tags Finally, 63 % of the words got all the required tags and only those If we combine the evaluation on capitalised and non-capitalised words, 85 % of all unknown words are perfectly tagged by the guesser, and 92 % get all the necessary tags (with possibly some unwanted ones  The same occurs with words ending in ement that are systematically tagged as [ADV NOUN-SG unless a longer ending like iquement is recognised As for missing tags, more than half are adjective tags for words that are otherwise correctly tagged as nouns or past participles (which somehow reduces the importance of the error, as the syntactic distribution of adjectives overlaps with those of nouns and past participles  The remaining words that lack at least one tag include misspelt words belonging to closed classes (come, trs, vavec) or to irregular verbs (constuit barbarisms resulting from the omission of blanks (proposde or from the adjunction of superfluous blanks or hyphens (quand-mme, so cit  We also had a few examples of compound nouns improperly tagged as singular nouns, e Finally, foreign words represent another class of problematic words, especially combination they are not nouns palazzi We have described the tagset, lexicon and guesser that we built for our French tagger If needed, we can do another lexicon lookup for words that have the tag VERB-SG-P3 and assign a tense to them after the disambiguation The guesser for words that are not in the lexicon is described in more detail Therefore, the tagset and the lexicon together may make finer distinctions than the tagger alone Our lexicon is based on a finite-state transducer lexicon  the verb reading for plastiques is impossible Because noun third-person sequence is relatively common, collapsing also the third person would cause trouble in parsing We have not introduced gender distinctions as far as nouns and adjectives (and incidentally determiners) are concerned Thus a feminine noun like chaise (chair) and a masculine noun like tabouret (stool) both receive the same tag NOUN-SG However, we have introduced distinctions between singular nouns (NOUN-SG plural nouns (NOUN-PL) and number-invariant nouns (NOUN-INV) such as taux (rate/rates  Ignoring gender distinction for a French tagger is certainly counter intuitive There are three major objections against this choice: Gender information would provide better disambiguation, Gender ambiguous nouns should be resolved, and Displaying gender provides more information For instance in le dcombinationfuseur dcombinationfuse, the word dcombinationfuse is ambiguous as a verb or as a feminine adjective This last category is unlikely after a masculine noun like dcombinationfuseur However, one may observe that gender agreement between nouns and adjectives often involve long distance dependencies, due for instance to coordination or to the adjunction of noun complements as in une envie de soleil dcombinationfuse where the feminine adjective dcombinationfuse agrees with the feminine noun envie In other words, introducing linguistically relevant information such as gender into the tagset is fine, but combination this information is not used in the linguistically relevant context, the benefit is unclear Another argument in favour of gender distinction is that some nouns are ambiguously masculine or feminine, with possible dcombinationferences in meaning, e A tagger that would carry on the distinction would then provide sense disambiguation for such words Actually, such gender-ambiguous words are not very frequent On the same 12 000-word test corpus, we counted 46 occurrences of words which have dcombinationferent meanings for the masculine and the feminine noun readings We also counted 325 occurrences of nouns (proper nouns excluded) which do not have dcombinationferent meanings in the masculine and the feminine readings, e la poste Finally, carrying the gender information does not itself increase the disambiguation power of the tagger A disambiguator that would explicitly mark gender distinctions in the tagset would not necessarily provide more information the final number of tags after disambiguation Gender information is certainly important in itself On our test corpus of 12 000 words, only three errors violate gender agreement This indicates how little the accuracy of the tagger could be improved by introducing gender distinction But because a word is typically associated with a sequence of tags, the number of dcombinationferent combinations is higher, 353 possible sequences for single French words rare words that do not fit into an existing category are collapsed together In a few instances, we introduced new categories for words that have a speccombinationic syntactic distribution For instance, we introduced a word-speccombinationic tag PREP-DE for words de, des and du, and tag PREP-A for words , au and aux The other readings of the words were not removed, e.
