 The second line: says that lexical meaning of that f-structure is  Each lexical entry will contain a composition language formula, its meaning constructor, specifying how a lexical entry contributes to lexical meaning of any structure in which it participates In principle, lexical meaning language can be any suitable logic The formula states that lexical verb left requires a meaning X for its subject, ; when that meaning is provided, lexical meaning for lexical sentence will be  When lexical words Bill and left are used in a sentence, lexical metavariable will be instantiated to a particular f-structure, and lexical meaning given in lexical lexical entry will be used as lexical meaning of that f-structure For conciseness, we will not illustrate lexical combination of lexical meaning constructors for every and man; instead, we will work with lexical derived meaning constructor for lexical subject every man, showing how it combines with lexical meaning constructor for left to produce a meaning constructor giving lexical meaning of lexical whole sentence The f-structure for lexical sentence Every man left is: f: The meaning constructors for every man and left are: The meaning constructor for left is as before The meaning constructor for every man quantifies over semantic projections H which constitute possible quantification scopes; its propositional structure corresponds to lexical standard type assignment,  The meaning S will be instantiated to  The meaning constructor for seek also allows for nonquantified objects as arguments, without needing a special type-raising rule.
