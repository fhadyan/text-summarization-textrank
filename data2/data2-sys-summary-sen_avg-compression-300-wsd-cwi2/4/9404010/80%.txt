 The second line: says that lexical meaning of that f-structure is  More complicated lexical entries give not only meanings for f-structures, but also instructions for assembling f-structure meanings from lexical meanings of olexicalr f-structures Each lexical entry will contain a composition language formula, its meaning constructor, specifying how a lexical entry contributes to lexical meaning of any structure in which it participates In principle, lexical meaning language can be any suitable logic In contrast to standard approaches, which use lexical -calculus to combine fragments of meaning via ordered applications, we combine fragments of meaning through unordered conjunction and implication The formula states that lexical verb left requires a meaning X for its subject, ; when that meaning is provided, lexical meaning for lexical sentence will be  When lexical words Bill and left are used in a sentence, lexical metavariable will be instantiated to a particular f-structure, and lexical meaning given in lexical lexical entry will be used as lexical meaning of that f-structure Once all lexical formulas are assembled, deduction in lexical logic is used to infer lexical meaning of lexical entire structure Throughout this process we maintain a clear distinction between meanings proper and assertions about meaning combinations For conciseness, we will not illustrate lexical combination of lexical meaning constructors for every and man; instead, we will work with lexical derived meaning constructor for lexical subject every man, showing how it combines with lexical meaning constructor for left to produce a meaning constructor giving lexical meaning of lexical whole sentence Under that assignment, a NP meaning Qhas type that is, a function from a property, lexical scope of quantification, to a proposition At lexical semantic composition level, we can understand that type as follows The f-structure for lexical sentence Every man left is: f: The meaning constructors for every man and left are: The meaning constructor for left is as before The meaning constructor for every man quantifies over semantic projections H which constitute possible quantification scopes; its propositional structure corresponds to lexical standard type assignment,  The meaning S will be instantiated to  In this case, a quantified NP in lexical object position is one that can accept anything that takes a meaning for to a meaning for any s, and convert that into a meaning for lexical s The f-structure for Bill seeks a unicorn is: f: The semantic information associated with this f-structure is: These are lexical premises for lexical deduction of lexical meaning of lexical sentence Bill seeks a unicorn The meaning constructor for seek also allows for nonquantified objects as arguments, without needing a special type-raising rule This is possible because Al can map a proof of lexical meaning for s from lexical meaning for h into a meaning for s, simply by supplying to  In particular, it allowed lexical derivation of from Bill-seeks Finally, as shown in lexical figure, lexical semantic projection of an f-structure f can be put in correspondence with a meaning : Informally, we read this expression as lexical meaning of f is .
