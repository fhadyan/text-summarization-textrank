 and naive to provide such a model, based on naive physics However, this is what K-context allows R to do F-context (factual context For this type of texts, there are two factual constraints bearing on the content of the text: - the text is a narration in which an accident takes place; - the text involves at least two participants, generally two vehicles, one of which is the author's This aspect of the texts is linked to E-context and the argumentative component in an accident report (A17)But this is not the case in , a text for which, if it was another type of narrative, we might imagine other endings to the incident (e but I was able to swerve and avoid it  We will see more instance of this in section , where we look at its argumentative effect The existence of the impact can then be deduced from a combination of several clues, some linguistic, some inferential Indeed the authors often mix first person expressions with these neutral third person labels From R's point of view, resolving the problem of reference, i The road is a narrow, windy road, lined with trees The second proposition introduces vehicule B, i the other vehicule involved in the accident In the third proposition, the reader encounters my left side mirror However, with the knowledge of this convention, coreference can be resolved Louvet's vehicle and W's Nothing, except F-context, warrants linking vehicle B and Mrs Louvet's, and at first glance, there could appear to be three vehicles in this scene Louvet is the driver of vehicle B and that there are only two vehicles involved These goals are not contradictory and actually become intermingled The argumentation may be explicit or left implicit It cut back in on my vehicle Since an accident has occurred, R may then deduce B's wrong behavior, which W then refers to explicitly at the end of the text At the same time, W takes care to insist on his own correct behavior (at moderate speed  (A11) The authors often express their own psychological states (e (17) b (A4) b The use of negation can also be a way of not mentioning explicitly the collision (see section  (18) I wasn't able to avoid the car which was coming with great speed Of course the two strategies are not mutually exclusive as shown by above (19) I was driving at about 45 km/h in a small one-way street where cars were parked on both sides Popping suddenly on my right coming out of a private building garage, Mrs It must then be the right blinker, since the vehicle is in the right lane Arguments of the Maxims type must then be used In addition, the verb s'apprter can have several interpretations It can also have a more agentive interpretation and then it means to actively prepare for The car skidded on the wet pavement and struck a sidewalk then a fence straight ahead (A5) Instead of using an imperfective verbal form (i This will succeed if R opts for a purely intentional reading of the verbal form We have tried to show the importance of situational, cultural and textual presuppositions from the point of view of both the writer and the reader We have determined three types of context: K-context, the non-linguistic knowledge required for this domain, F-context, the more specific context of the events being narrated, and E-context, the discourse context for this text type check that no vehicle is coming I was driving between two lanes of stopped cars when one of the cars on my left opened its right front door First, the two terms being used, vehicle and car, are compatible, indeed a car is a particular type of vehicle a car (4) b I was entering (vehicle A) the lane into a gas station (A17) b (A2) Metonymy is a general linguistic device, i Metonymy creates a unique discourse entity with properties coming from the elements being identified This metonymy allows transference of properties either from the driver to the car, e We show in section below the role played by metonymy in argumentation (5) b Vehicle B seemd to want to let vehicle A go through, (B42) b (A7) (6) b my bumper (A11) b.
