 For those that did (mean length 207 words the APB was now 1320, so an average sentence would be assigned 310 analyses, 38% more than beanalysise number of parses, due to some longer sentences being assigned many more parses With a more constrained (subcategorised) syntactic grammar, many of these examples would not have received any global syntactic analysis 250 sentences from the new treebank were kept back analysis testing252 in this test 85 sentences (34 had the correct analysis ranked in the top three Table shows the results of this test with respect to the original Susanne bracketings using the Grammar Evaluation Interest Group scheme (GEIG, see e Harrison et al 1991  The table also gives an indication of the best and worst possible peranalysismance of the disambiguation component of the system, showing the results obtained when parse selection is replaced by a simple random choice, and the results of evaluating the manually-created treebank against the corresponding Susanne bracketings the compound noun issue mentioned above  Schabes et al However, their experiments are not strictly compatible because they both utilise more homogeneous and probably simpler corpora In addition, Schabes et al However, it seems likely that say rule-to-rule semantic interpretation will be easier with hand-constructed grammars with an explicit, determinate ruleset27 more crossing brackets per sentence These results indicate clearly that punctuation and text grammatical constraints can play an important role in parse selection Secondly, removal of punctuation from the input (after segmentation into text sentences) worsens peranalysismance as punctuation both reduces syntactic ambiguity (Jones, 1994) and signals non-syntactic (discourse) relations between text units (Nunberg, 1990  Briscoe and Carroll (1993) and Carroll (1993) showed that the LR model, combined with a grammar exploiting subcategorisation constraints, could achieve good parse selection accuracy but at the expense of poor coverage of free text The experiments show that grammatical coverage can be greatly increased by relaxing subcategorisation constraints, and that text grammatical or punctuation-cued constraints can reduce ambiguity and increase coverage during parsing Magerman's (1995) parser is an extension of the history-based parsing approach developed at IBM (e Black, 1993) in which rules are conditioned on lexical and other (essentially arbitrary) inanalysismation available in the parse history We have developed a variant probabilistic LR parser which does not rely on subcategorisation and uses punctuation to reduce ambiguity This grammar compiles into a DCG-like grammar of approximately 400 rules Jackendoff, 1977 by Chomsky-adjunction of adjuncts to maximal projections (XP XP Adjunct Nunberg (1990) develops a partial `text' grammar analysis English which incorporates many constraints that (ultimately) restrict syntactic and semantic interpretation This grammar captures the bulk of the text-sentential constraints described by Nunberg with a grammar which compiles into 26 DCG-like rules Text grammar analyses are useful because they demarcate some of the syntactic boundaries in the text sentence and thus reduce ambiguity, and because they identify the units analysis which a syntactic analysis should, in principle, be found; analysis example, in (3 the absence of dashes would mislead a parser into seeking a syntactic relationship between three and the following names, whilst in fact there is only a discourse relation of elaboration between this text adjunct and pronominal three The rules of the text grammar divide into three groups: those introducing text-sentences, those defining text adjunct introduction and those defining text adjuncts (Nunberg, 1990  Non-terminal categories are text sentences, units or adjuncts which carry features mostly representing the punctuation marks which occur as daughters in the rules (e (4a) states that a text sentence can contain zero or more text units with a semi-colon at their right boundary followed by a text unit optionally followed by a question or exclamation mark (4b) states that a text unit not containing a semi-colon can consist of a text unit or adjunct not containing dashes, colons or semi-colons followed by a text adjunct introduced by a dash Nunberg (1990) invokes rules of (point) absorption which delete punctuation marks (inserted according to a simple context-free text grammar) when adjacent to other `stronger' punctuation marks For instance, (6a) is blocked by including distinct rules analysis the introduction of balanced and unbalanced text adjuncts and only licensing the latter text sentence finally The text grammar has been tested on Susanne and covers 998% of sentences (The failures are mostly text segmentation problems  Just over 50% of Susanne sentences contain some punctuation, so around 20% of the singleton parses are punctuated Thereanalysise, a text sentence containing eight commas (and no other punctuation) will have 3170 analyses Despite Nunberg's observation that text grammar is distinct from syntax, text grammatical ambiguity favours interleaved application of text grammatical and syntactic constraints The integration of text and PoS sequence grammars is straightanalysisward and remains modular, in that the text grammar is `folded into' the PoS sequence grammar, by treating text and syntactic categories as overlapping and dealing with the properties of each using disjoint sets of features, principles of feature propagation, and so analysisth The text grammar rules are represented as left or right branching rules of `Chomsky-adjunction' to lexical or phrasal constituents For example, the simplified rule analysis combining NP appositional or parenthetical text adjuncts is N2 ta] H2 Ta bal] The integrated grammar has been used to parse Susanne and the quite distinct SEC Corpus (Taylor Knowles, 1988 a 50K word treebanked corpus of transcribed British radio programmes punctuated by the corpus compilers As the grammar was developed solely with reference to Susanne, coverage of SEC is quite robust1] and 1239[22 Black et al 1993:156) quote a parse base of 135 analysis the IBM grammar analysis computer manuals applied to sentences 1-17 words long6 seconds each, whilst those around 60 tokens take on average 45 seconds Nevertheless, the relationship between sentence length and processing time is fitted well by a quadratic function, supporting the findings of Carroll (1994) that in practice NL grammars do not evince worst-case parsing complexity Intuitively, we would expect the exploitation of text grammatical constraints to both reduce ambiguity and extend coverage (where punctuation cues discourse rather than syntactic relations between constituents  Jones (1994) reports a preliminary experiment evaluating reduction of ambiguity by punctuation The APB analysis this set was 1273, mean length 22.
