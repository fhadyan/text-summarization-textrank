g a GB grammar O(2[n ,  structure proposing engines) while keeping the grammar constant A small principle-based parser was built, following the proper branch formalism developed in  X-bar Theory uses a set of schemata to license local subtrees Specifier (SPEC this feature specifies whether the word at the head of the phrase being built requires a specifier The head (i the main verbs were all from the set for which theta role data was obtained the examples were manually parsed by the authors The use of a heterogeneous grammar formalism and multiple probabilities invokes the problem of their combination Alternatively, a combination of some or all of the daughters' probability features could be employed, thus making, eg the X-bar probability of the mother dependent upon all the stochastic information from the daughters, including theta and Case probabilities, etc the X-bar, theta, etc was kept constant.
