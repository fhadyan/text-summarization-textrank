 Primarily, two sources have been examined: prosody and word stress Data on discovered word types helps make this comparison: DIST-FREE found 12% of the words with 30% accuracy and DIST-PHONO found 33% of the words with 50% accuracy Whereas the segmentation point data are inconclusive, word type data demonstrate that combining information sources is more useful than using distributional information alone Our technique segments continuous speech into words using only distributional and phonotactic information more effectively than one might expect up to 66% recall of segmentation points with 92% accuracy on one sample, which yields 58% recall of word types with 67% accuracy (the relatively low type accuracy is mitigated by the fact that most incorrect words are meaningful concatenations of correct words eg `thekitty g Jusczyk et al 1993b  Two such hypotheses are: lexicons: frequent words whereas Segmentation 2 yields a much larger lexicon of infrequent words We found that each source provided some useful information for speech segmentation, but the combination of sources provided substantial information 74-75  The lexicon lists words (represented as phoneme sequences) paired with their code after the other; the first column is called the word inventory column; the second column is called the code word inventory column The code word inventory column of the lexicon (see Figure for a schematic) has a nearly identical representation as the previous column except that code words are listed instead of phonemic words the length fields and unary prefix serve the same purpose of marking the divisions between code words The sample can be represented most compactly by assigning short code words to frequent words, reserving longer code words for infrequent words To satisfy this property, code words are assigned so that their lengths are frequency-based; the length of the code word for a word of frequency f(w) will not be greater than: The total length of the code word list is the sum of the code word lengths over all lexical entries: As in the word inventory column (described above the length of each code word is represented in a fixed-length field Finally, the sequence of words which form the sample (see Figure for a schematic) is represented as the number of words in the sample (m) followed by the list of code words The total length of the representation of the entire hypothesis is the sum of the representation lengths of the word inventory column, the code word inventory column and the sample.
