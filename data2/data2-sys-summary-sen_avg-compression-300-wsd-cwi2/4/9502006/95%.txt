 Some obligatory spelling changes in French involve more than one letter For case (2 the spelling rules may be applied directly, just as in rule compilation, to a specified surface or lexical character sequence, as if no lexical or morphotactic constraints existed Surface: chre Lexical: cher  Members of the surface and lexical strings may be characters or classes of single characters Figure shows three of the French spelling rules developed for this system The default rule that copies characters between surface and lexical levels and the boundary rule that deletes boundary markers are both optional This process results in a set of spelling patterns, one for each distinct application of the spelling rules to each affix sequence suggested by the production rules A spelling pattern consists of partially specified surface and lexical root character sequences, fully specified surface and lexical affix sequences, orthographic feature constraints associated with the spelling rules and affixes used, and a pair of syntactic category specifications derived from the production rules used One category is for the root form, and one for the inflected form Spelling patterns are indexed according to the surface (for analysis) and lexical (for generation) affix characters they involve Complications arise in spelling rule application from the fact that, at compile time, neither the lexical nor the surface form of the root, nor even its length, is known.
