 Unlike previous analyses, which postulate ambiguity of interpretation or derivation in the full clause source of the ellipsis, our analysis requires no such hidden ambiguity The antecedent or source clause is complete, whereas the target clause is missing (or contains only vestiges of) material found overtly in the source We know that the application of the property or relation to the parallel elements in the source constitutes the interpretation of the source clause Specifically, the interpretation of John greeted every person This sentence has a reading on which John finished reading both the poem and the short story before Bill finished reading the poem For instance, in the sentence John greeted every person when Bill did But VP ellipsis provides examples as well On an identity-of-relations analysis, such relations would be available only by virtue of their use in the derivation of the source clause interpretation This would necessitate the postulation of wild ambiguity in the source clause, one derivation for each possible case of subsequent ellipsis197 A difficulty in any identity-of-relations analysis, which makes available only one interpretation for subsequent clauses exhibiting ellipsis, is seen when a single sentence is the antecedent for the ellipsis of two different noun phrases On this reading, the source for both elliptical clauses is the same clause, `John finished reading the poem To produce a relation which can be the interpretation for the elided VP whose subject is Bill, the interpretation for the sentence `John finished reading the poem' must be derived as: so as to make available the property  On the desired reading, the interpretation for `John finished reading the poem' must be derived as: Under an identity-of-relations analysis, the source clause is deemed ambiguous between the two derivations John greeted every person when Bill did John greeted every person that Bill did We will take the source of the ellipsis in ( ) to be the clause `John greeted every person and the target to be `Bill did  The source clause is interpreted under a quantifier assumption generated by the subject NP That is, in an individual instance, the source clause is interpreted in one of several possible ways, leading to the use of a particular property in the interpretation; the property used in the target clause is identical to the corresponding property in the source clause Thus, the interpretation of the full sentence, with ellipsis resolved is The assumption may now be discharged, yielding the full interpretation This interpretation corresponds to a necessarily distributive reading, the `individual' reading, in which each person is simultaneously greeted by John and Bill We take the source clause to be the entire sentence, and the target to be, again, `Bill did  But in that case, the ellipsis equation will include the quantifier order manifest in the source clause interpretation, and this will be carried over to the target interpretation Under an identity-of-relations analysis, ambiguity of interpretation in a target clause comes about because the source clause is ambiguous This interpretation only makes sense as part of the derivation of the meaning of the whole source clause Purely interpretive analyses , allow for multiple semantic interpretations arising from an unambiguous syntactic analysis of the source clause Thus, under this analysis, the second ellipsis, `and Bill did too would be uninterpretable Nonetheless, if this were the meaning representation of the source of the second ellipsis, it would allow for a sloppy reading of the target; this would correspond to the sloppy reading (  It also allows for a third reading when used as the source for the second elliptical clause Our analysis produces six readings for the example sentence In Kamp's analysis, as in our own, ambiguities between strict and sloppy readings do not arise from ambiguity in the source clause; the source has only a single interpretation The following issues are problematic for most analyses of ellipsis interpretation Our analysis of ellipsis resolution presupposes identification of the source of the ellipsis and the parallel structuring of the source and target Our analysis does not require that the property provided as the interpretation for the elided portion of the target clause in examples like those above correspond to the interpretation of any constituent in the source clause The second of these readings would not be obtainable given ( ) as the source clause meaning This property will serve to generate the interpretation of the target clause On the excluded reading, the source clause is John revised his paper before the teacher did and the target clause is Bill did too  John and Bill are the parallel elements The properties that are generated as solutions to the equation are predicated of the parallel elements in the target clause to generate the target clause interpretation Either of the other two remaining properties yields a possible interpretation of the target clause.
