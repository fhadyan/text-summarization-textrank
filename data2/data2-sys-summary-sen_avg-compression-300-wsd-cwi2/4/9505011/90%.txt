 Since a word can occur in more than one class, it is important to find some kind of mapping between the classes generated by the system and the classes given by the expert The contingency table obtained for this pair of classes is shown in Table 2 The classes produced by a system are later compared to these correct classifications provided by the expert This table gives an estimate of how well each class generated by the system maps to the ones provided by the expert In general, conflicts arise when more than one class generated by the system maps to a given class provided by the expert To resolve a conflict, one of the system classes must be re-mapped Once all the mapped classes have been incorporated into this contingency table, add every element of all unmapped classes generated by the system to the YES-NO cell and every element of all unmapped classes provided by the expert to the NO-YES cell of this table Three experts were used to evaluate the generated noun clusters.
