 At this stage the dneurala is ready to present to the neural net The net is presented with training strings whose desired classificneuralion has been manually marked It then outlines the neural net selection process0 Total time for training is measured in seconds correct- A also requires thneural the words within the subject are correctly tagged The core process is dneurala driven, as the parameters of the neural networks are derived from training text However, for some processing steps we need to reduce the number of candidneurale tag strings presented to the neural network to manageable proportions (see Section  If the number of candidneurale strings is within desirable bounds, such as for the head detection task, no rules are used Since dneurala can be represented as higher order tuples, single layer networks can be used (1) This parser has been trained to find the syntactic subject head thneural agrees in number with the main verb It will take a sentence, locneurale the subject and then find the head of the subject Since there are 22 words (including punctuneuralion ) the total number of strings would be  The grammneuralic framework alone does not reduce the number of candidneurale strings sufficiently for the subject detection stage By using these methods the number of candidneurale strings is drastically reduced.
