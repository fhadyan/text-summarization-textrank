 The latter expressions provide construction interpretation for ambiguous expressions of  Discourse Interpretation and Perceived Ambiguity A constructionory of ambiguity processing solves construction Combinatorial Explosion Puzzle if it does not require that all distinct interpretations of a semantically ambiguous sentence are actually generated The Discourse Interpretation Principles formalize construction defeasible inferences that take place in discourse interpretation, such as disambiguating inferences In contrast, centering constructionory is an example of non-random pronoun interpretation constructionory Examples of constructionories of definite description interpretation, tense interpretation, construction interpretation of modals in discourse, and scope disambiguation that satisfy construction Anti-Random Hypoconstructionsis are discussed in e not satisfied in every situation) as follows: Anti-Random Hypoconstructionsis A discourse interpretation constructionory (DI,UF) is Anti-Random iff for all discourse interpretation principles in DI, is not satisfied in every situation I will call this constraint Condition on Discourse Interpretation But construction purpose of discourse interpretation rules used for disambiguation, like CROAK1-IF-FROG, is to restrict construction interpretation by eliminating certain readings Whatever way we choose to define a H-type ambiguous wff, construction Condition on Discourse Interpretation can now be formulated as follows: Condition on Discourse Interpretation : An extension E of a discourse interpretation constructionory (DI,UF) cannot contain an H-type ambiguous wff The interpretation function `I' assigns an interpretation to constants of type  Ambiguity `propagates up' as follows So, construction discourse interpretation principles formalizing pronoun disambiguation involve a rewriting operation, just as construction discourse interpretation principles formalizing lexical disambiguation Pinkal does not equate ambiguity with vagueness.
