 This paper concerns how to generate and understand discourse anaphoric noun phrases, or noun phrases (NPs) that evoke a discourse entity already in the discourse model (Webber webber78  Dale dale89 dale92 implements Gricean constraints on informativeness for generating discourse anaphoric NPs Results in include a one-way correlation of overly informative discourse anaphoric NPs with shifts in global discourse structure The data reported above indicates that in the Pear corpus, definite pronouns and phrasal NPs are rarely over-specified or over-determined Dale dale89 generates anaphoric pronouns and phrasal NPs by distinct means Dale dale89 requires phrasal NPs to be distinguishing descriptions Above, I noted that centering can add structure to the search space for understanding discourse anaphoric NPs In Fig , the feature increasing distinguishes between over-determined and over-specified NPs I have presented an analysis of discourse anaphoric phrasal NPs in a corpus of narrative monologues showing that pronouns and phrasal NPs are rarely over-specified Discourse anaphoric NPs almost never provide new information, and are rarely more informative than necessary Any phrasal NP that is discourse anaphoric is potentially over-specified, whereas a definite pronoun will only be over-specified if a zero pronoun could have been used I first sorted the discourse anaphoric NPs in the corpus (N=1,233) into the three categories of phrasal NPs (PhrNPs; N=563 explicit pronouns (PROs: definite, indefinite, demonstrative; N=544 and zero pronominals (ZPs; N=126  This procedure identified 128 discourse anaphoric NPs in the corpus that were potentially over-specified or over-determined To account for the choice of modifiers in phrasal discourse anaphoric NPs, it is necessary to determine how attributes are selected from the information known about a discourse entity.
