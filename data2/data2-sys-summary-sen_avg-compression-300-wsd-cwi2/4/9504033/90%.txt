 A noun architecture may be applied to noun compounds0) is used to favour a left-branching analysis Eight different training schemes have been used to estimate the parameters and each set of estimates used to analyse the test set under both the adjacency and the dependency model As can be seen, the dependency model is more accurate than the adjacency model0316 demonstrating the superiority of the dependency model, at least for the compounds within Grolier's encyclopedia To determine the difference made by conceptual association, the pattern training scheme has been retrained using lexical counts for both the dependency and adjacency model, but only for the words in the test set Each of two parameterisations are used: associations between words and associations between concepts One problem with the training methods given in section is the restriction of training data to nouns in  Three training schemes have been used and the tuned analysis procedures applied to the test set While Hindle and Rooth (1993) use a partial parser to acquire training data, such machinery appears unnecessary for noun compounds Given a three word compound, a search is conducted elsewhere in the corpus for each of the two possible subcomponents Resnik (1993) used unambiguous noun compounds from the parsed Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus to estimate the association values and analysed a test set of around 160 compounds Consider the compound calcium ion exchange, which is typically left-branching (that is, the first two words are bracketed together  The dependency model has also been proposed by Kobayasi et al (1994) for analysing Japanese noun compounds, apparently independently A test set of syntactically ambiguous noun compounds was extracted from our 8 million word Grolier's encyclopedia corpus in the following way All consecutive sequences of these words were extracted, and the three word sequences used to form the test set The remaining compounds were assigned either a left-branching or right-branching analysis One problem with applying lexical association to noun compounds is the enormous number of parameters required, one for every possible pair of nouns To ensure that the test set is disjoint from the training data, all occurrences of the test noun compounds have been removed from the training corpus.
