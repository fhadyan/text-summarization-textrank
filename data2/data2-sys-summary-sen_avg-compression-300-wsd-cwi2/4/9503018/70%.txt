 A communication strategy is a strategy for communicating with another agent Agents make strategy choices via decisions about when to talk, when to let the other agent talk, what to say, and how to say it Depending on the preceding communication, and the agent's attentional capacity, the propositions that an agent knows may or may not be salient when a proposal is made Another hypothetical factor was the relative cost of retrieval and communication These cost parameters support modeling various cognitive architectures, e varying the cost of retrieval models different assumptions about memory The experimental results in section show that effective strategies to support deliberation are determined by both cognitive and task variables Below we vary the relative cost of communication and retrieval Finally, we hypothesized that the Explicit-Warrant strategy may be beneficial if the relationship between the warrant and the proposal must be mutually believed Thus the definition of success for the task is a Design-World parameter: the Standard task does not require a shared warrant, whereas the Zero NonMatching Beliefs task gives a zero score to any negotiated plan without agreed-upon warrants To evaluate PERFORMANCE, we compare the Explicit-Warrant strategy with the All-Implicit strategy in situations where we vary the task requirements, agents' attentional capacity, and the cost of retrieval, inference and communication Evaluation of the resulting DESIGN-HOUSE plan is parametrized by (1) COMMCOST: cost of sending a message; (2) INFCOST: cost of inference; and (3) RETCOST: cost of retrieval from memory: PERFORMANCE RAW SCORE is task specific: in the Standard task we simply summarize the point values of the furniture pieces in each PUT-ACT in the final Design, while in the Zero NonMatching Beliefs task, agents get no points for a plan unless they agree on the reasons underlying each action that contributes to the plan The way PERFORMANCE is defined reflects the fact that agents are meant to collaborate on the task The costs that are deducted from the RAW SCORE are the costs for both agents' communication, inference, and retrieval Since the parameters for cognitive effort are fixed while communication strategy and AWM settings are varied, we can directly test the benefits of different communication strategies under different assumptions about cognitive effort and the cognitive demands of the task We simulate 100 dialogues at each parameter setting for each strategy This section discusses the results of comparing the Explicit-Warrant communication strategy with the All-Implicit communication strategy to determine when each strategy is BENEFICIAL One strategy that supports deliberation is the Explicit-Warrant strategy, as in 0 We test 4 factors outlined in figure : when the warrant is salient or not, when the warrant is required for the task or not, when the costs of retrieval and communication vary, and when retrieval is indeterminate Differences in performance between the Explicit-Warrant strategy and the All-Implicit strategy are shown via a DIFFERENCE PLOT such as figure  Dialogues in which one or both agents use the Explicit-Warrant strategy are more efficient when retrieval has a cost Figure shows that the Explicit-Warrant strategy is DETRIMENTAL at AWM of 3,4,5 for the Standard task, in comparison with the All-Implicit strategy, if retrieval from memory is free (KS 3,4,5 ] 19, p [  This is because making the warrant salient displaces information about other pieces of furniture when agents are attention-limited However, figure shows that Explicit-Warrant is beneficial when retrieval is one tenth the cost of communication and inference23, p [  Other experiments show that even when the relative cost of retrieval is 0001, that Explicit-Warrant is still beneficial at AWM settings of 11 and 16 (KS for 11,16 ] 23 , p [ 23, p[  If communication is expensive compared to retrieval, communication cost can dominate the other benefits If we change the definition of success in the task, we change whether a strategy is beneficial When the task is Zero-Nonmatching-Beliefs, the Explicit-Warrant strategy is beneficial even if retrieval is free (KS ] 23 for AWM from 2 to 11, p [  Consider a situation in which an agent A wants an agent B to accept a proposal P The strategy virtually guarantees that the agents will agree on the reasons for carrying out a particular course of action23, p [  See figure  In other words, even when every extra WARRANT message incurs a penalty of 10 points, if the task is Zero-NonMatching-Beliefs, agents using Explicit-Warrant do better This paper has discussed an instance of a general problem in the design of conversational agents: when to include optional information If B is a `helpful' agent (nonautonomous B will accept A's proposal without a warrant when AWM is very limited and warrants are not required to be shared The method used here is a new experimental methodology for computational linguistics that supports testing hypotheses about beneficial communication strategies ,  To my knowledge, no previous work on dialogue has ever argued that conversational agents' resource limits are a major factor in determining effective conversational strategies in collaboration The results presented here suggest that cooperative strategies cannot be defined in the abstract, but cooperation arises from the interaction of two agents in dialogue Here we compared two communication strategies: All-Implicit and Explicit-Warrant Although much work remains to be done, there is reason to believe that these results are domain independent Since a warrant makes the dialogue longer, the Explicit-Warrant strategy might be inefficient whenever either of these situations hold Then B cannot decide whether to accept P without a warrant whether the warrant is already accessible in B's working memory ,  Thus A's strategy choice may depend on A's model of B's attentional state, as well as the costs of retrieval and inference as opposed to communication Some tasks require that two agents agree on the reasons for adopting a proposal, e Figure summarizes these hypotheses by proposing a hypothetical decision tree for an agent's choice of whether to use the Explicit-Warrant strategy To my knowledge, all previous work on dialogue has simply assumed that an agent should never tell an agent facts that the other agent already knows Given these hypotheses, what is required is a way to test the hypothesized relationship of task and cognitive factors to effective communication strategies Design-World is an experimental environment for testing the relationship between communication strategies, task parameters and agents' cognitive capabilities, similar to the single agent TileWorld simulation environment ,  Design-World agents can be parametrized as to communication strategy, and the effects of this strategy can be measured against a range of cognitive and task parameters This paper compares the Explicit-Warrant strategy to the All-Implicit strategy as strategies for supporting deliberation The Design-World task requires two agents to carry out a dialogue in order to negotiate an agreement on the design of the floor plan of a two room house  (reject agent-kim agent-bill option-56: put-act (agent-kim purple couch room-1 On receiving a proposal, an agent deliberates whether to ACCEPT or REJECT the proposal  The Design-World experiments reported here compare the All-Implicit strategy with the Explicit-Warrant strategy Agents are parametrized for different communication strategies by placing different expansions of communication plans in their plan libraries Discourse plans are plans for PROPOSAL, REJECTION, ACCEPTANCE, CLARIFICATION, OPENING and CLOSING The All-Implicit strategy is an expansion of a communication plan to make a PROPOSAL, in which a PROPOSAL decomposes trivially to the communicative act of PROPOSE In dialogue 0, both Design-World agents communicate using the All-Implicit strategy, and the proposals are shown in utterances 1, 2, and 3 The All-Implicit strategy never includes warrants in proposals, leaving it up to the other agent to retrieve them from memory The Explicit-Warrant strategy expands the PROPOSAL communication act to be a WARRANT followed by a PROPOSE utterance This paper presents a new experimental method for determining whether a communication strategy is effective and presents experimental results on a strategy for supporting deliberation The Explicit-Warrant strategy models naturally occurring examples such as those in because the points information used by the hearer to deliberate whether to accept or reject the proposal is already mutually believed We hypothesized that a warrant must be SALIENT for both agents (as shown by example .
