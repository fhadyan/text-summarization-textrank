 A communication strategy is a strategy for communicating with another agent varying the cost of retrieval models different assumptions about memory To evaluate PERFORMANCE, we compare the Explicit-Warrant strategy with the All-Implicit strategy in situations where we vary the task requirements, agents' attentional capacity, and the cost of retrieval, inference and communication This section discusses the results of comparing the Explicit-Warrant communication strategy with the All-Implicit communication strategy to determine when each strategy is BENEFICIAL One strategy that supports deliberation is the Explicit-Warrant strategy, as in 019, p [ 23, p [  Other experiments show that even when the relative cost of retrieval is 0001, that Explicit-Warrant is still beneficial at AWM settings of 11 and 16 (KS for 11,16 ] 23 , p [ 23, p[ 23 for AWM from 2 to 11, p [ 23, p [  See figure  In other words, even when every extra WARRANT message incurs a penalty of 10 points, if the task is Zero-NonMatching-Beliefs, agents using Explicit-Warrant do better Here we compared two communication strategies: All-Implicit and Explicit-Warrant This paper compares the Explicit-Warrant strategy to the All-Implicit strategy as strategies for supporting deliberation The Design-World experiments reported here compare the All-Implicit strategy with the Explicit-Warrant strategy The Explicit-Warrant strategy expands the PROPOSAL communication act to be a WARRANT followed by a PROPOSE utterance.
