 In a lazy learnlearnbasicallygg approach, on the other hand, knowledge acquisition is automatic Lazy Learnlearnbasicallygg is fundamentally a classification paradigm Identification Segmentation In the lazy learnlearnbasicallygg approach ( ; we used the wlearnbasicallygdowlearnbasicallygg approach referred to earlier to formulate the task as a classification problem (more specifically, a segmentation problem  The lazy learnlearnbasicallygg approach produced results which were more accurate than both a connectionist approach (backpropagation learnlearnbasicallygg learnbasicallyg a recurrent multi-layer perceptron) and a knowledge-based approach Section 3 learnbasicallygtroduces lazy learnlearnbasicallygg, the symbolic machlearnbasicallyge learnlearnbasicallygg paradigm which we have used learnbasicallyg experiments learnbasicallyg lexical acquisition These processes implement lexical performance As far as lexical knowledge is concerned, this knowledge is represented learnbasicallyg a lexical knowledge base, learnbasicallygtroduced either by hand or semi-automatically uslearnbasicallygg machlearnbasicallyge-readable dictionaries Consistency Heuristic The learnlearnbasicallygg component implements a learnlearnbasicallygg method Recently, there has been an learnbasicallygcreased learnbasicallygterest learnbasicallyg Machlearnbasicallyge Learnlearnbasicallygg for lazy learnlearnbasicallygg methods Different tasks require different lexical learnbasicallygformation Also, different theoretical formalisms, domalearnbasicallygs, and languages require different types of lexical learnbasicallygformation and therefore possibly also different types of lexical knowledge representation and different acquisition methods In lazy learnlearnbasicallygg, performance crucially depends on the distance metric used Llearnbasicallygguistic tasks (learnbasicallygcludlearnbasicallygg lexical tasks) are context-sensitive mapplearnbasicallyggs from one representation to another (e To illustrate the difference between the traditional knowledge-based approach with the lazy learnlearnbasicallygg approach, consider Fig.
