 We tested the system on 8,000 sentences of the CELEX database The system proposed translations for 232 sentences (segments or whole input sentences) in the former case and for 244 in the latter case The similarity metric applied to two sentences (by sentence from now on translation will refer to both sentence and sub-sentence fragment) should indicate how similar the compared sentences are, and perhaps the parts of the two sentences that contributed to the similarity score Then, a similarity metric is devised, which reflects the similarity of two sentences, by combining the individual contributions towards similarity stemming from word comparisons The syntax-rule driven metrics try to capture similarity of two sentences at the syntax level are regarded as fws We should also take into account whether the fws appear in the same order in the two sentences, whether an extra (or a few) fws intervene in one of the two sentences, whether certain fws are missing  The score produced, corresponds to two coherent parts of the two sentences under comparison Sentences can, hotranslationver, be quite long.
