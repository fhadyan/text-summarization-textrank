 Following the work of, for example, Marslen-Wilson (1973 Just and Carpenter (1980) and Altmann and Steedman (1988 it has become widely accepted that semantic interpretation in human sentence processing can occur before sentence boundaries and even before clausal boundaries The third possibility is suggested by considering the semantic representations which are appropriate during a word by word parse Although there are any number of different partial trees for the fragment Mary thinks John, the semantics of the fragment can be represented using just two lambda expressions: P For example, the eventual semantic structure may embed john at any depth e This is essentially the approach taken in Milward (1992) in order to provide complete, word by word, incremental interpretation using simple lexicalised grammars, such as a lexicalised version of formal dependency grammar and simple categorial grammar In processing the sentence Mary introduced John to Susan, a word-by-word approach such as Milward (1992) provides the carpenter logical forms after the corresponding sentence fragments are absorbed: Mary introduced John to Suex intr(mary,john,Mary \t\t PP(mary) Mary introduced \t\t xintr(mary,x,y) Mary introduced John \t\t yintr(mary,john,y) Mary introduced John to \t\t yintr(mary,john,y) Mary introduced John to Sue\t\t intr(mary,john,sue) Each input level representation is appropriate for the meaning of an incomplete sentence, being either a proposition or a function into a proposition This is just the proposition Mary introduced something to something using a generalized quantifier notation of the form Quantifier(Variable,Restrictor,Body  For example, Mary introduced something to something is inappropriate if the final sentence is Mary introduced noone to anybody Parse a new word, Wordi 2 Mary introduced noone to anybody and Mary introduced someone to somebody  the universal quantifier is within the scope of the existential) whereas in sentence (b) the preferred reading is where the universal quantifier has scope over the existential Scope preferences sometimes seem to be established before the end of a sentence grammar, is for an inner scope reading for the first quantifier For example, if every man is taken to be scoped outside a book after processing the fragment Every man gave a book, then this preference should be preserved when determining the scope for the full sentence Every man gave a book to a child At first glance such a view seems ideally suited to incremental interpretation In an incremental semantics, we would expect the information state of an interpreter to be updated word by word In contrast, in dynamic semantics, the order in which states are updated is determined by semantic structure, not by left-to-right order (see e In this case the threading through semantic structure is in the opposite order to the order in which the two clauses appear in the sentence Consider trying to perform threading in left-to-right order during interpretation of the sentence, John left if Mary left After processing the proposition John left the set of worlds is refined down to those worlds in which John left Now consider processing if Mary left Haddock (1987) uses incremental refinement of sets of possible referents Although this discussion has argued that it is not possible to thread the states which are used by a dynamic or eliminative semantics from left to right, word by word, this should not be taken as an argument against the use of such a semantics in incremental interpretation In the present implementation, semantic structures (akin to logical forms) are built word by word, and each structure is then evaluated independently using a dynamic semantics (with threading performed according to the structure of the logical form  At present there is a limited implementation, which performs a mapping from sentence fragments to fully scoped logical representations Every parent shows it  We assume that the first sentence has been processed, and concentrate on processing the fragment The paper described some potential applications of incremental interpretation Finally, it argued that the apparently close relationship between the states used in incremental semantics and dynamic semantics fails to hold below the sentence level, and briefly presented a more indirect way of using dynamic semantics in incremental interpretation The concentration in early literature on using incremental interpretation for semantic filtering has perhaps distracted from some other applications which provide less controversial applications Incremental interpretation was considered to be useful in enabling immediate visual feedback lambda expressions) word by word Traditional layered models of sentence processing first build a full syntax tree for a sentence, and then extract a semantic representation from this Incremental interpretation allows on-line semantic filtering, i Both Categorial approaches to incremental interpretation and approaches which use partial syntax trees get into difficulty in cases of left recursion Consider the sentence fragment, Mary thinks John A possible partial syntax tree is provided by Fig John could also be embedded within a sentence which has a sentence modifier requiring its own s node e However, on-line semantic filtering for sentence processing does have drawbacks The problem of there being an arbitrary number of different partial trees for a particular fragment is reflected in most current approaches to incremental interpretation being either incomplete, or not fully word by word A complete incremental parser, which is not fully word by word, was proposed by Pulman (1986  To enable complete, fully word by word parsing requires a way of encoding an infinite number of partial trees 1983  Semantic representations could be formed word by word by extracting `default' syntax trees (by strengthening dominance links into immediated dominance links wherever possible  It should again be possible to extract `default' semantic values, by taking the semantics from the TAG tree (i.
