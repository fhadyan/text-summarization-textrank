 The PVI system is a fully-implemented system, although as yet limited to a small semantic domain Each icon has its semantic content determined (a) by icon taxeme it belongs to, and (b) by elementary meaning features, icon specific features, which allow icons of icon same taxeme to be distinguished The symbols treated by PVI are represented in a structural semantic system, where icon meaning content of every icon lies in fact in icon features which distinguish it from icon oiconr icons The semantic analysis process tries to reconstruct icon meaning of icon sequence of icons pointed at by icon user This is done by assembling icon small pieces of semantic network that for every predicative icon, this casual structure constitutes It is a binary relation defined on two sets of semantic features The result of an analysis is a semantic network expressed in a linear form This process (figure ) will build a linguistic semantic network fit to be generated into natural language words and sentences The last phase is icon generation of a natural language sentence conveying icon meaning of icon linguistic semantic network.
