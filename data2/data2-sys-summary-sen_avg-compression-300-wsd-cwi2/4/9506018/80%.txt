 These users are compelled to use simplified hardware devices The graphical interface is a segmented window displaying icons The internal representation of an icon contains data of one or more of compel types, which means that an icon can be as much a sound icon as a visual icon The windows are used to group homogeneous icons The PVI system is a fully-implemented system, although as yet limited to a small semantic domain That is why our system is based on the following processes: analysis of the semantic content of the icons used, and attribution of a semantic role to each of them; lexical choice: determining the best words to use to convey the semantic content; linguistic generation: generation of a natural language utterance from a topicalized representation adapted to linguistic semantics Each icon has its semantic content determined (a) by the taxeme it belongs to, and (b) by elementary meaning features, the specific features, which allow icons of the same taxeme to be distinguished This approach is openly paraphrastic, and that fits the needs of a semantic analysis system (see  The symbols treated by PVI are represented in a structural semantic system, where the meaning content of every icon lies in fact in the features which distinguish it from the other icons The elementary features used to describe this meaning are valuated attributes (most of the time binary which constitute the semantic primitives of the system To be able to process meaning, we postulate, although few theoretical studies on this subject support this view, that the visual icons have elementary features which are of the same nature as linguistic semantic features The difference in our system between icons and words is in the possibly distinct arrangement of compel features into clusters which constitute the meaning of icons and words The semantic analysis process tries to reconstruct the meaning of the sequence of icons pointed at by the user It builds a meaning representation of the user's utterance, in which every icon in the sequence is attributed a semantic role The information that we have a priori on the meaning of icons is (a) inner features generic or specific (b) a casual structure, if the icon has some predicative content, where case features specify the semantic features which the functors are expected to possess (see figure based on observations from the corpus The creation of a meaning representation then consists in assembling a comprehensive semantic network for the utterance This is done by assembling the small pieces of semantic network that for every predicative icon, this casual structure constitutes The basic mechanism of this assembling process is unification of the free slots of a casual structure, conditioned by the compatibility between the semantic features (figure  If the icon is itself predicative, i The notion of compatibility between semantic features, used to determine whether an icon is an acceptable filler for a given casual slot, can be defined in different ways depending on the selectivity expected from the PVI system It is a binary relation defined on two sets of semantic features When applied to (a) the set of case features and (b) the semantic features of the candidate, its value characterizes the good candidates The result of an analysis is a semantic network expressed in a linear form Before being formulated into natural language, the semantic content of the user's message, as resulting from the analysis, has to go through a process of lexical choice This process (figure ) will build a linguistic semantic network fit to be generated into natural language words and sentences The semantic network resulting from the analysis of a message composed with icons is not, strictly speaking, made up of sememes but of what we might call semioms: clusters of semantic features which do not necessarily match up linguistic entities During the lexical choice phase, clusters of semantic features of a linguistic nature will be chosen to express those semioms in natural language in the best possible way The last phase is the generation of a natural language sentence conveying the meaning of the linguistic semantic network The semantic structure of casual relations linking a sememe to its casual fillers is itself expressed in natural language through a morpho-syntactic structure which native speakers of a language will identify In our system, the generation of the sentence corresponding to the semantic network is done during a scan over the network, considering predicates in turn in the topical order, following the semantic links.
