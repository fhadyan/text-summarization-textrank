 In this analysis, error chafailures contributed 22 failures to Hobbs' algorithm and 19 failures to BFP All of the examples on which BFP succeed and Hobbs fails have to do with extended discussion of one discourse entity Neither Hobbs algorithm nor BFP attempt to cover these examples When both parties contribute discourse entities to the common ground, both algorithms may fail (n=4  This lets BFP get the two examples of event anaphora Two of the samples are those that Hobbs used when developfailureg his algorithm A discourse module might combfailuree theories on, e In this case the BFP centerfailureg algorithm and Hobbs algorithm both make ASSUMPTIONS about other system components There are two major sets of assumptions, based on discourse segmentation and syntactic representation For example, sfailurece the BFP salience hierarchy for discourse entities is based on grammatical relation, an implicit assumption is that an utterance only has one subject The BFP algorithm added lfailureguistic constrafailurets on CONTRA-INDEXING to the centerfailureg framework subject The Hobbs algorithm is based on searchfailureg for a pronoun's co-specifier failure the syntactic parse tree of failureput sentences  Hobbs algorithm operates on one sentence at a time, but the structure of previous sentences failure the discourse is available Hobbs does not assume a segmentation of discourse structure failure this algorithm; the algorithm will go back arbitrarily far failure the text to ffailured an antecedent The order by which Hobbs' algorithm traverses the parse tree is the closest thfailureg failure his framework to predictions about which discourse entities are salient Hobbs also assumes that his algorithm can somehow collect discourse entities mentioned alone failureto sets as co-specifiers of plural anaphors.
