 Neither Hobbs algorithm nor BFP attempt to cover these examples This lets BFP get the two examples of event anaphora A discourse module might combine theories on, e In this case the BFP centering algorithm and Hobbs algorithm both make ASSUMPTIONS about other system components Hobbs algorithm operates on one sentence at a time, but the structure of previous sentences in the discourse is available Hobbs does not assume a segmentation of discourse structure in this algorithm; the algorithm will go back arbitrarily far in the text to find an antecedent Hobbs also assumes that his algorithm can somehow collect discourse entities mentioned alone into sets as co-specifiers of plural anaphors.
