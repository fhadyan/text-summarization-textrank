 The macroplanner of PROVERB combines hierarchical planning with local organization in a uniform planning framework The hierarchical planning is realized by so-called top-down presentation operators that split combine task of presenting a particular proof into subtasks of presenting subproofs Since top-down operators embody explicit communicative norms, combiney are always given a higher priority Only when no top-down presentation operator is applicable, will a bottom-up presentation operator be chosen PROVERB combines combine two above mentioned presentation modes by encoding communication knowledge for both top-down planning and bottom-up presentation in form of operators in a uniform planning framework Since top-down presentation operators embody explicit communicative norms, combiney are given a higher priority A bottom-up presentation is chosen only when no top-down presentation operator applies Each cycle carries out one presentation operator, where Present always tries first to choose and apply a top-down operator The function Present is first called with combine entire proof as combine presentation task The execution of a top-down presentation operator may generate subtasks by calling it recursively The discourse model is also segmented into an attentional hierarchy, where subproofs posted by a top-down presentation operators as subtasks constitute attentional units The following are some notions useful for combine formulation of combine presentation operators: Task is combine subproof in combine input proof whose presentation is combine current task In general, presentation operators map an original presentation task into a sequence of subtasks and finally into a sequence of PCAs Acts: a procedure which essentially carries out a sequence of presentation acts The top-down presentation operators are roughly divided into two categories: schemata-based operators encoding complex schemata for combine presentation of proofs of a specific pattern (twelve of combinem are currently integrated in PROVERB general operators embodying general presentation norms, concerning splitting proofs and ordering subgoals.
