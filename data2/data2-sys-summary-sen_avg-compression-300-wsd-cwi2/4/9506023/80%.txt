 Scientific discovery was one of the favourite topics of Renaissance scholars (F Mill's methods for induction are introduced, and a system incorporating these methods is described, using as illustrations a simple deciphering problem and the discovery of (a part of) the famous Germanic Consonant Shift, known as Grimm's Law MILL's data representation is a simple Object-Attribute-Value knowledge structure Its discovery process is, in essence, an attempt to apply one or more of the above methods The study of discovery in linguistics is not fashionable today Thus, some methods (e MA a discovery using both (i Discovery has had its good days, reaching its climax in the works of American descriptivists, and esp zbwb occurs in obs Now we may look briefly at the discovery process It is indeed true that their discovery procedures (of a segmentation-and-classification type purporting to uncover the grammar of a language from a corpus of that language, significantly contributed to the understanding of the process, and served as a basis for later grammar learning systems and toolkits for linguistic fieldwork Nevertheless, it will be clear that a discovery process, relying on Mill's methods, will make a system simple, and at the same time quite general and powerful; thus the system has re-discovered a number of further sound laws, and was successfully tested in its role as a tool in the solutions of diverse field linguistic problems Finally, although we have considered only linguistic discovery, the system may be, obviously, applied to discovering empirical regularities in other fields as well However, the descriptivists' reduction of linguistic theory to a manual of procedures, and doing linguistics to following these procedures proved to be a too extreme and simplistic view to act as an incentive for the further study of discovery issues by later generations of linguists In his influential book Syntactic Structures Chomsky made a devastating criticism of descriptivists' discovery procedures, totally shifting the focus on grammar justification it is questionable whether /procedures of analysis/ can be formulated rigorously, exhaustively and simply enough to qualify as practical and mechanical discovery procedure Very significant contributions to a general understanding of the discovery process have come from various Renaissance disciplines, incl Not only discovery rules, as conceived by descriptivists, but the mere word discovery have eversince acquired strongly negative connotations for the influential transformational grammarians, so that many other linguists have had to be very diplomatic on the subject Another major factor contributing to the neglect of the study of discovery issues in linguistics is a view which may be called naive inductivism  What I have in mind is not some worked out system of beliefs, or a coherent theory, but rather some disparate and vague sentiments, sometimes deeply rooted in linguistic conscience, as to the primary and exclusive role of data gathering and observation/generalization in the process of linguistic discovery This amounts to looking upon the process of discovery of a hypothesis (or problem solution) as springing immediately and without appeal to any systematic modes of reasoning from observation and generalization of the data gathered First, mere observation or data gathering without some prior hypothesis/problem is a poor starting point for making a discovery since we do not know just which facts to observe or gather In effect, in many disciplines to date discovery is considered quite a respectable object of investigation And, in the second place, any (linguistic) discovery, contrary to the tenet discussed, is as a rule empirically underdetermined Botha 1980 who devotes a whole chapter to a (philosophically-oriented) treatment of linguistic discovery  also Pericliev 1990) where some heuristics are illustrated with a real research problem; a book on linguistic discovery is under preparation  Mill (Mill 1879) formulated several methods canons for discovery of causally related facts in a set of instances (observations  Then, the heursitics are provided with somewhat simplistic linguistic examples, and their implications for the computational modeling of (linguistic) discovery are briefly discussed For instance, one of the founders of modern linguistics characterized synchronic linguistics as finding form-meaning correspondences: In human speech, different sounds have different meanings So they have been widely used in the process of linguistic inquiry Their use may be unconscious (often disguised as specific litmus) tests discovery procedures etc in fact directly based on Mill's canons or it may be conscious (e Psychological plausibility is a further feature which a discovery system may profitably possess.
