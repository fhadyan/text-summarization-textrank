 If this value exceeds his confidence threshold, then he will accept the plan From this suggestion the initiator might expand her expression to the tall funny-looking building The result of the plan is the surface speech action, s-suggest, that communicates the suggestion However, only the initiator of the referring expression can actually elaborate a referring expression, because only she has the knowledge to do so Depending on whether the hearer of the expression makes a suggestion or not, the initiator has two options when elaborating a plan If possible, she should use the suggestion to elaborate the plan, thus avoiding unwanted conversational implicature, but its use may not be enough to make the plan adequate The plan constructor attempts to find a plan with the surface speech actions for the suggested attribute in its yield, but this might not be possible An agent constructs a referring expression plan by using the referent's most salient features In this model, the initiator has the goal of having the recipient identthresholdy the referent, and so constructs a referring plan given a set of beliefs about what the recipient believes The result of the initiator's plan is a set of surface speech actions, and hearing only these actions, the recipient tries to infer a plan in order to understand the reference Thus, referring expressions are represented as plan derivations, and an unsuccessful referring expression is an invalid plan in whose repair the agents collaborate If the recipient finds the initial referring expression plan invalid, then the agents will collaborate in its repair Thus, a collaborative dialogue is modeled in terms of the evolution of the referring plan First, an agent must communicate that she has not understood a plan What criteria, then, does he base his understanding on? The basis of our model is that the hearer can accept a referring expression plan threshold (1) the plan contains a description that is useful for making an identthresholdication plan that the hearer can execute to identthresholdy the referent, and (2) the hearer is confident that the identthresholdication plan is adequate We take the referring expression plan itself to be the identthresholdication plan The mental actions in the plan will encode only useful descriptions In our model, each agent associates a numeric confidence value with each of the attributes in the referring expression, and by composing these, computes a level of confidence in the adequacy of the complete referring expression plan that can be interpreted as ranging from low confidence to high confidence If the overall confidence value exceeds some set value, the agent's confidence threshold, then the agent believes the plan is adequate Now, the confidence value of each attribute is equivalent to its salience within the context of the referring expression When the hearer is not confident, the speaker and hearer collaborate to make a new referring expression that the hearer believes is adequate Each agent has his own beliefs about salience So, the hierarchy is accessed during both plan construction and plan inference In plan construction, the hierarchy is used for constructing initial referring expression plans, and for elaborating on inadequate plans by allowing an agent to choose the most salient properties of the referent first The agent constructs an initial referring expression plan in almost the same way as in Heeman and Hirst's system Mental actions in the intermediate plans of a referring expression plan allow the speaker to choose the most salient attributes that have not yet been chosen, and constraints in the surface speech actions make sure the speaker believes that each attribute is true During plan inference, the salience hierarchy is used when evaluating a recognized plan The final constraint in the plan makes sure that the hearer's confidence threshold is exceeded Thus, judging the adequacy of a referring expression plan falls out of the regular plan evaluation process.
