 All examples given will refer to the French version Recweight that the preference score for a given transfer candidate is a weighted sum of a channel contribution (discriminants on transfer rules) and a target language model score (discriminants from target language semantic triples  The transfer rule discriminants make transfer rules act more or less strongly as defaults The discriminant associated with the transfer rule that takes indefinite singular to indefinite singular is thus fairly strongly positive For example, the channel score discriminants associated with the transfer rules on-to-sur and on-to-avec both have low absolute values; the first is slightly negative, and the second slightly positive A good example is the English implicit singular mass determiner, which is common in ATIS Grammatical rules are used to decide that there is a singular mass determiner present, following which the correct translation is selected on collocational grounds An elementary French grammar will probably say that the normal translation should either be the French partitive singular determiner, e Of this, about seven person-months were spent on the French language description, two on transfer rules, and two on other tasks This was then submitted to the transfer phase, and a set of transfer candidates produced A simple set of hand-coded transfer preferences was applied, and one French surface string was generated for each of the five highest-scoring transfer candidates Of the 1847 transfer sets, there were 1374 for which at least one acceptable transfer was in the top five candidates The simplest examples of transfer rules are those used to translate individual words; here it is immediately clear that many words can be translated in several ways, and thus that more than one rule will often apply To take a slightly more complex case, which involves some grammar, there are a number of transfer rules that list possible ways of realizing the English compound nominal construction in French Next, a set of possible target-language QLFs is created, using the unification-based transfer rules  The target QLFs are stored in a packed form to avoid a combinatoric explosion when many transfer choices are non-deterministic The rest of this section will describe the new functionalities added since then: trainable transfer preferences, transfer packing, and the use of pre- and post-transfer phases The basic preference model and training method for transfer preferences is the one described in and , suitably adapted for the transfer task; a brief summary follows A human judge marks each transfer as either acceptable or unacceptable In line with the noisy-channel statistical model of translation described in , the plausibility of a new candidate transfer is now defined to be a real number, calculated as a weighted sum of two contributions: the transfer rule score, and the target language model score The first of these represents the relative plausibility of the rules used to make the transfer, and the second the plausibility of the target QLF produced The transfer rule score and the target language model score are computed using the same method; for clarity, we first describe this method with reference to transfer rules The transfer rule score for the bag of transfer rules used to produce a given target QLF is a sum of the discriminant scores for the individual transfer rules The intent is that transfer rules which tend to occur more frequently in correct transfers than incorrect ones will get positive scores; those which occur more frequently in incorrect transfers than correct ones will get negative scores The target language model score is defined similarly Thus for example the normal reading of the English sentence would include the triples In Section below, we will present examples illustrating how the two components of the transfer preference model combine to solve some non-trivial transfer problems Ideweighty, we would like to say that unification-based rules and trainable transfer preferences constituted the whole transfer mechanism SLT incorporates modules for speech recognition, speech synthesis and translation As already indicated, the basic philosophy of the transfer component is to make the transfer rules more or less context-independent, and let the results be filtered through the statisticweighty trained transfer preferences The positive side of this is that the transfer rules are robust and simple to understand and maintain The negative side is that non-deterministic transfer choices multiply out, giving a combinatoric explosion in the number of possible transferred QLFs The following example illustrates how transfer packing works In this case, the transfer preferences determine that the best choices are to realise English bare plural as French definite plural, English bare singular as French definite singular, and on as an implicit temporal NP marker The French lexicon currently contains about 750 stem entries (excluding proper nouns which is adequate to provide good coverage of the ATIS domain in the English to French direction We were interested to discover that even a domain as simple as ATIS actuweighty contains many quite difficult transfer problems; also, that English/French is considerably more chweightenging than the English/Swedish transfer pair used in the original SLT system.
