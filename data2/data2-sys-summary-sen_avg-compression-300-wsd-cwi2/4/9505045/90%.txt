 Recall that the preference score for a given transfer candidate is a weighted sum of a channel contribution (discriminants on transfer rules) and a target language model score (discriminants from target language semantic triples  The transfer rule discriminants make transfer rules act more or less strongly as defaults The discriminant associated with the transfer rule that takes indefinite singular to indefinite singular is thus fairly strongly positive So we have e Of this, about seven person-months were spent on the French language description, two on transfer rules, and two on other tasks This was then submitted to the transfer phase, and a set of transfer candidates produced A simple set of hand-coded transfer preferences was applied, and one French surface string was generated for each of the five highest-scoring transfer candidates Of the 1847 transfer sets, there were 1374 for which at least one acceptable transfer was in the top five candidates Next, a set of possible target-language QLFs is created, using the unification-based transfer rules  The basic preference model and training method for transfer preferences is the one described in and , suitably adapted for the transfer task; a brief summary follows The first of these represents the relative plausibility of the rules used to make the transfer, and the second the plausibility of the target QLF produced The transfer rule score and the target language model score are computed using the same method; for clarity, we first describe this method with reference to transfer rules The transfer rule score for the bag of transfer rules used to produce a given target QLF is a sum of the discriminant scores for the individual transfer rules The target language model score is defined similarly Ideally, we would like to say that unification-based rules and trainable transfer preferences constituted the whole transfer mechanism As already indicated, the basic philosophy of the transfer component is to make the transfer rules more or less context-independent, and let the results be filtered through the statistically trained transfer preferences The following example illustrates how transfer packing works In this case, the transfer preferences determine that the best choices are to realise English bare plural as French definite plural, English bare singular as French definite singular, and on as an implicit temporal NP marker We were interested to discover that even a domain as simple as ATIS actually contains many quite difficult transfer problems; also, that English/French is considerably more challenging than the English/Swedish transfer pair used in the original SLT system.
