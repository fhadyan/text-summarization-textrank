 Would there be a potential fit with the dynamic semantic theories in linguistics (e.g Kamp, 1981; Heim, 1982; Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1991) in a way that forms a basis for an integrated logical model of discourse semantics and pragmatics? In this paper, I propose a pronoun interpretation model taking ideas from both computational and linguistic traditions, and present it in such a way that it becomes tractable for logical implementation.
