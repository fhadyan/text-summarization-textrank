 Instead of concentrating on linguistic engineering of theory-neutral, poly-theoretic, multi-applicable lexical representations combined with semi-automatic migration of lexical knowledge between different formats, we propose an approach in which a single inductive learning method is reused on different corpora representing useful linguistic mappings, acquiring the necessary lexical information automatically and implicitly.
