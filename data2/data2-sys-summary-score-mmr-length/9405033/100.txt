 Additional reasons for the relatively poor performance of the CE parser are the overheads involved in maintaining a sparse representation of the chart, and the fact that with the ANLT grammar it generates less densely packed parse forests, since its parse table, with 14% more states (though fewer actions) than the LALR(1) table, encodes more contextual distinctions (Billot Lang, 1989:146
