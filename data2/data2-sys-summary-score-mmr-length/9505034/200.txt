 First of all, the semantics of expressions such as that, for historical reasons, I call logical forms can be computed in a completely classical fashion using the storage mechanism , with the result that syntactic constraints on the available readings, such as the Scope Constraint , can play a role in determining the semantics of these objects, without the need for additional constraints such as the label ordering constraints used in UDRS .
